.. py:class:: CloudTrail.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS CloudTrail
   

  This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.

   

  CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service.

   

  .. note::

     

    As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the `Tools for Amazon Web Services page <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/>`__ .

     

   

  See the `AWS CloudTrail User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html>`__ for information about the data that is included with each AWS API call listed in the log files.

  .. py:method:: add_tags(**kwargs)

    

    Adds one or more tags to a trail, up to a limit of 50. Overwrites an existing tag's value when a new value is specified for an existing tag key. Tag key names must be unique for a trail; you cannot have two keys with the same name but different values. If you specify a key without a value, the tag will be created with the specified key and a value of null. You can tag a trail that applies to all AWS Regions only from the Region in which the trail was created (also known as its home region).

    :type S3BucketName: string
    :param S3BucketName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing log files. See `Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/create_trail_naming_policy.html>`__ .

      

    
    :type S3KeyPrefix: string
    :param S3KeyPrefix: 

      Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information, see `Finding Your CloudTrail Log Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-find-log-files.html>`__ . The maximum length is 200 characters.

      

    
    :type SnsTopicName: string
    :param SnsTopicName: 

      Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.

      

    
    :type IncludeGlobalServiceEvents: boolean
    :param IncludeGlobalServiceEvents: 

      Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from global services such as IAM to the log files.

      

    
    :type IsMultiRegionTrail: boolean
    :param IsMultiRegionTrail: 

      Specifies whether the trail is created in the current region or in all regions. The default is false, which creates a trail only in the region where you are signed in. As a best practice, consider creating trails that log events in all regions.

      

    
    :type EnableLogFileValidation: boolean
    :param EnableLogFileValidation: 

      Specifies whether log file integrity validation is enabled. The default is false.

       

      .. note::

         

        When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail will not create digest files for log files that were delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10. The same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.

         

      

    
    :type CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn: string
    :param CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn: 

      Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a unique identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will be delivered. Not required unless you specify CloudWatchLogsRoleArn.

    :param KmsKeyId: 

      Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by "alias/", a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.

       

      Examples:

       

       
      * alias/MyAliasName 
       
      * arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName 
       
      * arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 
       
      * 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 
       

      

    
    :type IsOrganizationTrail: boolean
    :param IsOrganizationTrail: 

      Specifies whether the trail is created for all accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations, or only for the current AWS account.

       ``arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail``  

       

      If an empty list is specified, information for the trail in the current region is returned.

       

       
      * If an empty list is specified and ``IncludeShadowTrails`` is false, then information for all trails in the current region is returned. 
       
      * If an empty list is specified and IncludeShadowTrails is null or true, then information for all trails in the current region and any associated shadow trails in other regions is returned. 
       

       

      .. note::

         

        If one or more trail names are specified, information is returned only if the names match the names of trails belonging only to the current region. To return information about a trail in another region, you must specify its trail ARN.

         

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type includeShadowTrails: boolean
    :param includeShadowTrails: 

      Specifies whether to include shadow trails in the response. A shadow trail is the replication in a region of a trail that was created in a different region, or in the case of an organization trail, the replication of an organization trail in member accounts. If you do not include shadow trails, organization trails in a member account and region replication trails will not be returned. The default is true.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **TrailARN** *(string) --* 

          The specified trail ARN that has the event selectors.

          
        

        - **EventSelectors** *(list) --* 

          The event selectors that are configured for the trail.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors will be configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event.

             

            You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

             

            You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.

            
            

            - **ReadWriteType** *(string) --* 

              Specify if you want your trail to log read-only events, write-only events, or all. For example, the EC2 ``GetConsoleOutput`` is a read-only API operation and ``RunInstances`` is a write-only API operation.

               

              By default, the value is ``All`` .

              
            

            - **IncludeManagementEvents** *(boolean) --* 

              Specify if you want your event selector to include management events for your trail.

               

              For more information, see `Management Events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-management-events>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

               

              By default, the value is ``true`` .

               

              The first copy of management events is free. You are charged for additional copies of management events that you are logging on any subsequent trail in the same region. For more information about CloudTrail pricing, see `AWS CloudTrail Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing/>`__ .

              
            

            - **DataResources** *(list) --* 

              CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3 objects and AWS Lambda functions with basic event selectors. You can specify up to 250 resources for an individual event selector, but the total number of data resources cannot exceed 250 across all event selectors in a trail. This limit does not apply if you configure resource logging for all data events. 

               

              For more information, see `Data Events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-data-events>`__ and `Limits in AWS CloudTrail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/WhatIsCloudTrail-Limits.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                The Amazon S3 buckets, AWS Lambda functions, or Amazon DynamoDB tables that you specify in your event selectors for your trail to log data events. Data events provide information about the resource operations performed on or within a resource itself. These are also known as data plane operations. You can specify up to 250 data resources for a trail.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The total number of allowed data resources is 250. This number can be distributed between 1 and 5 event selectors, but the total cannot exceed 250 across all selectors.

                   

                  If you are using advanced event selectors, the maximum total number of values for all conditions, across all advanced event selectors for the trail, is 500.

                   

                 

                The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket named ``bucket-1`` . In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and the option to log both ``Read`` and ``Write`` data events.

                 

                 
                * A user uploads an image file to ``bucket-1`` . 
                 
                * The ``PutObject`` API operation is an Amazon S3 object-level API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that occur on any object in that bucket are logged. The trail processes and logs the event. 
                 
                * A user uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named ``arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2`` . 
                 
                * The ``PutObject`` API operation occurred for an object in an S3 bucket that the CloudTrail user didn't specify for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event. 
                 

                 

                The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of AWS Lambda data events for a Lambda function named *MyLambdaFunction* , but not for all AWS Lambda functions.

                 

                 
                * A user runs a script that includes a call to the *MyLambdaFunction* function and the *MyOtherLambdaFunction* function. 
                 
                * The ``Invoke`` API operation on *MyLambdaFunction* is an AWS Lambda API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified logging data events for *MyLambdaFunction* , any invocations of that function are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.  
                 
                * The ``Invoke`` API operation on *MyOtherLambdaFunction* is an AWS Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify logging data events for all Lambda functions, the ``Invoke`` operation for *MyOtherLambdaFunction* does not match the function specified for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.  
                 

                
                

                - **Type** *(string) --* 

                  The resource type in which you want to log data events. You can specify ``AWS::S3::Object`` , ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` , or ``AWS::DynamoDB::Table`` resources.

                   

                  The ``AWS::S3Outposts::Object`` , ``AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node`` , and ``AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint`` resource types are not valid in basic event selectors. To log data events on these resource types, use advanced event selectors.

                  
                

                - **Values** *(list) --* 

                  An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or partial ARN strings for the specified objects.

                   

                   
                  * To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets in your AWS account, specify the prefix as ``arn:aws:s3:::`` .  

                  .. note::

                     This will also enable logging of data event activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if that activity is performed on a bucket that belongs to another AWS account.  

                   
                   
                  * To log data events for all objects in an S3 bucket, specify the bucket and an empty object prefix such as ``arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/`` . The trail logs data events for all objects in this S3 bucket. 
                   
                  * To log data events for specific objects, specify the S3 bucket and object prefix such as ``arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/example-images`` . The trail logs data events for objects in this S3 bucket that match the prefix. 
                   
                  * To log data events for all Lambda functions in your AWS account, specify the prefix as ``arn:aws:lambda`` . 

                  .. note::

                     This will also enable logging of ``Invoke`` activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if that activity is performed on a function that belongs to another AWS account.  

                   
                   
                  * To log data events for a specific Lambda function, specify the function ARN. 

                  .. note::

                     Lambda function ARNs are exact. For example, if you specify a function ARN *arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld* , data events will only be logged for *arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld* . They will not be logged for *arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld2* . 

                   
                   
                  * To log data events for all DynamoDB tables in your AWS account, specify the prefix as ``arn:aws:dynamodb`` .

            - **ExcludeManagementEventSources** *(list) --* 

              An optional list of service event sources from which you do not want management events to be logged on your trail. In this release, the list can be empty (disables the filter), or it can filter out AWS Key Management Service events by containing ``"kms.amazonaws.com"`` . By default, ``ExcludeManagementEventSources`` is empty, and AWS KMS events are included in events that are logged to your trail. 

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
        
      
        

        - **AdvancedEventSelectors** *(list) --* 

          The advanced event selectors that are configured for the trail. 

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Advanced event selectors let you create fine-grained selectors for the following AWS CloudTrail event record ﬁelds. They help you control costs by logging only those events that are important to you. For more information about advanced event selectors, see `Logging data events for trails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

             

             
            * ``readOnly``   
             
            * ``eventSource``   
             
            * ``eventName``   
             
            * ``eventCategory``   
             
            * ``resources.type``   
             
            * ``resources.ARN``   
             

             

            You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.

            
            

            - **Name** *(string) --* 

              An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector, such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              
            

            - **FieldSelectors** *(list) --* 

              Contains all selector statements in an advanced event selector.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A single selector statement in an advanced event selector.

                
                

                - **Field** *(string) --* 

                  A field in an event record on which to filter events to be logged. Supported fields include ``readOnly`` , ``eventCategory`` , ``eventSource`` (for management events), ``eventName`` , ``resources.type`` , and ``resources.ARN`` . 

                   

                   
                  * **``readOnly`` ** - Optional. Can be set to ``Equals`` a value of ``true`` or ``false`` . A value of ``false`` logs both ``read`` and ``write`` events. 
                   
                  * **``eventSource`` ** - For filtering management events only. This can be set only to ``NotEquals``  ``kms.amazonaws.com`` . 
                   
                  * **``eventName`` ** - Can use any operator. You can use it to ﬁlter in or ﬁlter out any data event logged to CloudTrail, such as ``PutBucket`` . You can have multiple values for this ﬁeld, separated by commas. 
                   
                  * **``eventCategory`` ** - This is required. It must be set to ``Equals`` , and the value must be ``Management`` or ``Data`` . 
                   
                  * **``resources.type`` ** - This ﬁeld is required. ``resources.type`` can only use the ``Equals`` operator, and the value can be one of the following: ``AWS::S3::Object`` , ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` , ``AWS::DynamoDB::Table`` , ``AWS::S3Outposts::Object`` , ``AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node`` , or ``AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint`` . You can have only one ``resources.type`` ﬁeld per selector. To log data events on more than one resource type, add another selector. 
                   
                  * **``resources.ARN`` ** - You can use any operator with resources.ARN, but if you use ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the value must exactly match the ARN of a valid resource of the type you've speciﬁed in the template as the value of resources.type. For example, if resources.type equals ``AWS::S3::Object`` , the ARN must be in one of the following formats. To log all data events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use the ``StartsWith`` operator, and include only the bucket ARN as the matching value. The trailing slash is intentional; do not exclude it. 

                     
                    * ``arn:partition:s3:::bucket_name/``   
                     
                    * ``arn:partition:s3:::bucket_name/object_or_file_name/``   
                     

                   

                  When resources.type equals ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

                   

                     
                    * ``arn:partition:lambda:region:account_ID:function:function_name``   
                     

                   

                  When resources.type equals ``AWS::DynamoDB::Table`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

                   

                     
                    * ``arn:partition:dynamodb:region:account_ID:table:table_name``   
                     

                   

                  When ``resources.type`` equals ``AWS::S3Outposts::Object`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

                   

                     
                    * ``arn:partition:s3-outposts:region:>account_ID:object_path``   
                     

                   

                  When ``resources.type`` equals ``AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

                   

                     
                    * ``arn:partition:managedblockchain:region:account_ID:nodes/node_ID``   
                     

                   

                  When ``resources.type`` equals ``AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

                   

                     
                    * ``arn:partition:s3-object-lambda:region:account_ID:accesspoint/access_point_name``   
                     

                   
                   

                  
                

                - **Equals** *(list) --* 

                  An operator that includes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . This is the only valid operator that you can use with the ``readOnly`` , ``eventCategory`` , and ``resources.type`` fields. 

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **StartsWith** *(list) --* 

                  An operator that includes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . 

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **EndsWith** *(list) --* 

                  An operator that includes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . 

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --*

                  An operator that excludes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . 

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --*

  .. py:method:: lookup_events(**kwargs)

    

    Looks up `management events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html#cloudtrail-concepts-management-events>`__ or `CloudTrail Insights events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html#cloudtrail-concepts-insights-events>`__ that are captured by CloudTrail. You can look up events that occurred in a region within the last 90 days. Lookup supports the following attributes for management events:

     

     
    * AWS access key 
     
    * Event ID 
     
    * Event name 
     
    * Event source 
     
    * Read only 
     
    * Resource name 
     
    * Resource type 
     
    * User name 
     

     

    Lookup supports the following attributes for Insights events:

     

     
    * Event ID 
     
    * Event name 
     
    * Event source 
     

     

    All attributes are optional. The default number of results returned is 50, with a maximum of 50 possible. The response includes a token that you can use to get the next page of results.

     

    .. warning::

       

      The rate of lookup requests is limited to two per second, per account, per region. If this limit is exceeded, a throttling error occurs.

  .. py:method:: put_event_selectors(**kwargs)

    

    Configures an event selector or advanced event selectors for your trail. Use event selectors or advanced event selectors to specify management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors are configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events.

     

    When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event. 

     

    Example

     

     
    * You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want write-only events. 
     
    * The EC2 ``GetConsoleOutput`` and ``RunInstances`` API operations occur in your account. 
     
    * CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors. 
     
    * The ``RunInstances`` is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the event. 
     
    * The ``GetConsoleOutput`` is a read-only event that doesn't match your event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.  
     

     

    The ``PutEventSelectors`` operation must be called from the region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an ``InvalidHomeRegionException`` exception is thrown.

     

    You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more information, see `Logging data and management events for trails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__ and `Quotas in AWS CloudTrail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/WhatIsCloudTrail-Limits.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

     

    You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selectors on a trail. You can use either ``AdvancedEventSelectors`` or ``EventSelectors`` , but not both. If you apply ``AdvancedEventSelectors`` to a trail, any existing ``EventSelectors`` are overwritten. For more information about advanced event selectors, see `Logging data events for trails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

    :type TrailName: string
    :param TrailName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail name, the string must meet the following requirements:

       

       
      * Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (_), or dashes (-) 
       
      * Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number 
       
      * Be between 3 and 128 characters 
       
      * Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like ``my-_namespace`` and ``my--namespace`` are invalid. 
       
      * Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4) 
       

       

      If you specify a trail ARN, it must be in the format:

       

       ``arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail``  

      

    
    :type EventSelectors: list
    :param EventSelectors: 

      Specifies the settings for your event selectors. You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail. You can use either ``EventSelectors`` or ``AdvancedEventSelectors`` in a ``PutEventSelectors`` request, but not both. If you apply ``EventSelectors`` to a trail, any existing ``AdvancedEventSelectors`` are overwritten.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors will be configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event.

         

        You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

         

        You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.

        

      
        - **ReadWriteType** *(string) --* 

          Specify if you want your trail to log read-only events, write-only events, or all. For example, the EC2 ``GetConsoleOutput`` is a read-only API operation and ``RunInstances`` is a write-only API operation.

           

          By default, the value is ``All`` .

          

        
        - **IncludeManagementEvents** *(boolean) --* 

          Specify if you want your event selector to include management events for your trail.

           

          For more information, see `Management Events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-management-events>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

           

          By default, the value is ``true`` .

           

          The first copy of management events is free. You are charged for additional copies of management events that you are logging on any subsequent trail in the same region. For more information about CloudTrail pricing, see `AWS CloudTrail Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing/>`__ .

          

        
        - **DataResources** *(list) --* 

          CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3 objects and AWS Lambda functions with basic event selectors. You can specify up to 250 resources for an individual event selector, but the total number of data resources cannot exceed 250 across all event selectors in a trail. This limit does not apply if you configure resource logging for all data events. 

           

          For more information, see `Data Events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-data-events>`__ and `Limits in AWS CloudTrail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/WhatIsCloudTrail-Limits.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            The Amazon S3 buckets, AWS Lambda functions, or Amazon DynamoDB tables that you specify in your event selectors for your trail to log data events. Data events provide information about the resource operations performed on or within a resource itself. These are also known as data plane operations. You can specify up to 250 data resources for a trail.

             

            .. note::

               

              The total number of allowed data resources is 250. This number can be distributed between 1 and 5 event selectors, but the total cannot exceed 250 across all selectors.

               

              If you are using advanced event selectors, the maximum total number of values for all conditions, across all advanced event selectors for the trail, is 500.

               

             

            The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket named ``bucket-1`` . In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and the option to log both ``Read`` and ``Write`` data events.

             

             
            * A user uploads an image file to ``bucket-1`` . 
             
            * The ``PutObject`` API operation is an Amazon S3 object-level API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that occur on any object in that bucket are logged. The trail processes and logs the event. 
             
            * A user uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named ``arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2`` . 
             
            * The ``PutObject`` API operation occurred for an object in an S3 bucket that the CloudTrail user didn't specify for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event. 
             

             

            The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of AWS Lambda data events for a Lambda function named *MyLambdaFunction* , but not for all AWS Lambda functions.

             

             
            * A user runs a script that includes a call to the *MyLambdaFunction* function and the *MyOtherLambdaFunction* function. 
             
            * The ``Invoke`` API operation on *MyLambdaFunction* is an AWS Lambda API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified logging data events for *MyLambdaFunction* , any invocations of that function are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.  
             
            * The ``Invoke`` API operation on *MyOtherLambdaFunction* is an AWS Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify logging data events for all Lambda functions, the ``Invoke`` operation for *MyOtherLambdaFunction* does not match the function specified for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.  
             

            

          
            - **Type** *(string) --* 

              The resource type in which you want to log data events. You can specify ``AWS::S3::Object`` , ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` , or ``AWS::DynamoDB::Table`` resources.

               

              The ``AWS::S3Outposts::Object`` , ``AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node`` , and ``AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint`` resource types are not valid in basic event selectors. To log data events on these resource types, use advanced event selectors.

              

            
            - **Values** *(list) --* 

              An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or partial ARN strings for the specified objects.

               

               
              * To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets in your AWS account, specify the prefix as ``arn:aws:s3:::`` .  

              .. note::

                 This will also enable logging of data event activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if that activity is performed on a bucket that belongs to another AWS account.  

               
               
              * To log data events for all objects in an S3 bucket, specify the bucket and an empty object prefix such as ``arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/`` . The trail logs data events for all objects in this S3 bucket. 
               
              * To log data events for specific objects, specify the S3 bucket and object prefix such as ``arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/example-images`` . The trail logs data events for objects in this S3 bucket that match the prefix. 
               
              * To log data events for all Lambda functions in your AWS account, specify the prefix as ``arn:aws:lambda`` . 

              .. note::

                 This will also enable logging of ``Invoke`` activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if that activity is performed on a function that belongs to another AWS account.  

               
               
              * To log data events for a specific Lambda function, specify the function ARN. 

              .. note::

                 Lambda function ARNs are exact. For example, if you specify a function ARN *arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld* , data events will only be logged for *arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld* . They will not be logged for *arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld2* . 

               
               
              * To log data events for all DynamoDB tables in your AWS account, specify the prefix as ``arn:aws:dynamodb`` . 
               

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
          
          
      
        - **ExcludeManagementEventSources** *(list) --* 

          An optional list of service event sources from which you do not want management events to be logged on your trail. In this release, the list can be empty (disables the filter), or it can filter out AWS Key Management Service events by containing ``"kms.amazonaws.com"`` . By default, ``ExcludeManagementEventSources`` is empty, and AWS KMS events are included in events that are logged to your trail. 

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    :type AdvancedEventSelectors: list
    :param AdvancedEventSelectors: 

      Specifies the settings for advanced event selectors. You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selectors on a trail. You can use either ``AdvancedEventSelectors`` or ``EventSelectors`` , but not both. If you apply ``AdvancedEventSelectors`` to a trail, any existing ``EventSelectors`` are overwritten. For more information about advanced event selectors, see `Logging data events for trails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* . 

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Advanced event selectors let you create fine-grained selectors for the following AWS CloudTrail event record ﬁelds. They help you control costs by logging only those events that are important to you. For more information about advanced event selectors, see `Logging data events for trails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

         

         
        * ``readOnly``   
         
        * ``eventSource``   
         
        * ``eventName``   
         
        * ``eventCategory``   
         
        * ``resources.type``   
         
        * ``resources.ARN``   
         

         

        You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector, such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

          

        
        - **FieldSelectors** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Contains all selector statements in an advanced event selector.

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            A single selector statement in an advanced event selector.

            

          
            - **Field** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              A field in an event record on which to filter events to be logged. Supported fields include ``readOnly`` , ``eventCategory`` , ``eventSource`` (for management events), ``eventName`` , ``resources.type`` , and ``resources.ARN`` . 

               

               
              * **``readOnly`` ** - Optional. Can be set to ``Equals`` a value of ``true`` or ``false`` . A value of ``false`` logs both ``read`` and ``write`` events. 
               
              * **``eventSource`` ** - For filtering management events only. This can be set only to ``NotEquals``  ``kms.amazonaws.com`` . 
               
              * **``eventName`` ** - Can use any operator. You can use it to ﬁlter in or ﬁlter out any data event logged to CloudTrail, such as ``PutBucket`` . You can have multiple values for this ﬁeld, separated by commas. 
               
              * **``eventCategory`` ** - This is required. It must be set to ``Equals`` , and the value must be ``Management`` or ``Data`` . 
               
              * **``resources.type`` ** - This ﬁeld is required. ``resources.type`` can only use the ``Equals`` operator, and the value can be one of the following: ``AWS::S3::Object`` , ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` , ``AWS::DynamoDB::Table`` , ``AWS::S3Outposts::Object`` , ``AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node`` , or ``AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint`` . You can have only one ``resources.type`` ﬁeld per selector. To log data events on more than one resource type, add another selector. 
               
              * **``resources.ARN`` ** - You can use any operator with resources.ARN, but if you use ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the value must exactly match the ARN of a valid resource of the type you've speciﬁed in the template as the value of resources.type. For example, if resources.type equals ``AWS::S3::Object`` , the ARN must be in one of the following formats. To log all data events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use the ``StartsWith`` operator, and include only the bucket ARN as the matching value. The trailing slash is intentional; do not exclude it. 

                 
                * ``arn:partition:s3:::bucket_name/``   
                 
                * ``arn:partition:s3:::bucket_name/object_or_file_name/``   
                 

               

              When resources.type equals ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

               

                 
                * ``arn:partition:lambda:region:account_ID:function:function_name``   
                 

               

              When resources.type equals ``AWS::DynamoDB::Table`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

               

                 
                * ``arn:partition:dynamodb:region:account_ID:table:table_name``   
                 

               

              When ``resources.type`` equals ``AWS::S3Outposts::Object`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

               

                 
                * ``arn:partition:s3-outposts:region:>account_ID:object_path``   
                 

               

              When ``resources.type`` equals ``AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

               

                 
                * ``arn:partition:managedblockchain:region:account_ID:nodes/node_ID``   
                 

               

              When ``resources.type`` equals ``AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

               

                 
                * ``arn:partition:s3-object-lambda:region:account_ID:accesspoint/access_point_name``   
                 

               
               

              

            
            - **Equals** *(list) --* 

              An operator that includes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . This is the only valid operator that you can use with the ``readOnly`` , ``eventCategory`` , and ``resources.type`` fields. 

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
          
            - **StartsWith** *(list) --* 

              An operator that includes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . 

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
          
            - **EndsWith** *(list) --* 

              An operator that includes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . 

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
          
            - **NotEquals** *(list) --* 

              An operator that excludes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . 

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
          
            - **NotStartsWith** *(list) --* 

              An operator that excludes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . 

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
          
            - **NotEndsWith** *(list) --* 

              An operator that excludes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **TrailARN** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the ARN of the trail that was updated with event selectors. The format of a trail ARN is:

           

           ``arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail``  

          
        

        - **EventSelectors** *(list) --* 

          Specifies the event selectors configured for your trail.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors will be configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event.

             

            You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

             

            You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.

            
            

            - **ReadWriteType** *(string) --* 

              Specify if you want your trail to log read-only events, write-only events, or all. For example, the EC2 ``GetConsoleOutput`` is a read-only API operation and ``RunInstances`` is a write-only API operation.

               

              By default, the value is ``All`` .

              
            

            - **IncludeManagementEvents** *(boolean) --* 

              Specify if you want your event selector to include management events for your trail.

               

              For more information, see `Management Events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-management-events>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

               

              By default, the value is ``true`` .

               

              The first copy of management events is free. You are charged for additional copies of management events that you are logging on any subsequent trail in the same region. For more information about CloudTrail pricing, see `AWS CloudTrail Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing/>`__ .

              
            

            - **DataResources** *(list) --* 

              CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3 objects and AWS Lambda functions with basic event selectors. You can specify up to 250 resources for an individual event selector, but the total number of data resources cannot exceed 250 across all event selectors in a trail. This limit does not apply if you configure resource logging for all data events. 

               

              For more information, see `Data Events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-data-events>`__ and `Limits in AWS CloudTrail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/WhatIsCloudTrail-Limits.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                The Amazon S3 buckets, AWS Lambda functions, or Amazon DynamoDB tables that you specify in your event selectors for your trail to log data events. Data events provide information about the resource operations performed on or within a resource itself. These are also known as data plane operations. You can specify up to 250 data resources for a trail.

                  The total number of allowed data resources is 250. This number can be distributed between 1 and 5 event selectors, but the total cannot exceed 250 across all selectors.

                   

                  If you are using advanced event selectors, the maximum total number of values for all conditions, across all advanced event selectors for the trail, is 500.

                   

                 

                The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket named ``bucket-1`` . In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and the option to log both ``Read`` and ``Write`` data events.

                 

                 
                * A user uploads an image file to ``bucket-1`` . 
                 
                * The ``PutObject`` API operation is an Amazon S3 object-level API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that occur on any object in that bucket are logged. The trail processes and logs the event. 
                 
                * A user uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named ``arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2`` . 
                 
                * The ``PutObject`` API operation occurred for an object in an S3 bucket that the CloudTrail user didn't specify for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event. 
                 

                 

                The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of AWS Lambda data events for a Lambda function named *MyLambdaFunction* , but not for all AWS Lambda functions.

                 

                 
                * A user runs a script that includes a call to the *MyLambdaFunction* function and the *MyOtherLambdaFunction* function. 
                 
                * The ``Invoke`` API operation on *MyLambdaFunction* is an AWS Lambda API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified logging data events for *MyLambdaFunction* , any invocations of that function are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.  
                 
                * The ``Invoke`` API operation on *MyOtherLambdaFunction* is an AWS Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify logging data events for all Lambda functions, the ``Invoke`` operation for *MyOtherLambdaFunction* does not match the function specified for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.  
                 

                
                

                - **Type** *(string) --* 

                  The resource type in which you want to log data events. You can specify ``AWS::S3::Object`` , ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` , or ``AWS::DynamoDB::Table`` resources.

                   

                  The ``AWS::S3Outposts::Object`` , ``AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node`` , and ``AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint`` resource types are not valid in basic event selectors. To log data events on these resource types, use advanced event selectors.

                  
                

                - **Values** *(list) --* 

                  An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or partial ARN strings for the specified objects.

                   

                   
                  * To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets in your AWS account, specify the prefix as ``arn:aws:s3:::`` .  

                  .. note::

                     This will also enable logging of data event activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if that activity is performed on a bucket that belongs to another AWS account.  

                   
                   
                  * To log data events for all objects in an S3 bucket, specify the bucket and an empty object prefix such as ``arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/`` . The trail logs data events for all objects in this S3 bucket. 
                   
                  * To log data events for specific objects, specify the S3 bucket and object prefix such as ``arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/example-images`` . The trail logs data events for objects in this S3 bucket that match the prefix. 
                   
                  * To log data events for all Lambda functions in your AWS account, specify the prefix as ``arn:aws:lambda`` . 

                  .. note::

                     This will also enable logging of ``Invoke`` activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if that activity is performed on a function that belongs to another AWS account.  

                   
                   
                  * To log data events for a specific Lambda function, specify the function ARN. 

                  .. note::

                     Lambda function ARNs are exact. For example, if you specify a function ARN *arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld* , data events will only be logged for *arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld* . They will not be logged for *arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld2* . 

                   
                   
                  * To log data events for all DynamoDB tables in your AWS account, specify the prefix as ``arn:aws:dynamodb`` . 
                   

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
            
          
            

            - **ExcludeManagementEventSources** *(list) --* 

              An optional list of service event sources from which you do not want management events to be logged on your trail. In this release, the list can be empty (disables the filter), or it can filter out AWS Key Management Service events by containing ``"kms.amazonaws.com"`` . By default, ``ExcludeManagementEventSources`` is empty, and AWS KMS events are included in events that are logged to your trail. 

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
        
      
        

        - **AdvancedEventSelectors** *(list) --* 

          Specifies the advanced event selectors configured for your trail.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Advanced event selectors let you create fine-grained selectors for the following AWS CloudTrail event record ﬁelds. They help you control costs by logging only those events that are important to you. For more information about advanced event selectors, see `Logging data events for trails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

             

             
            * ``readOnly``   
             
            * ``eventSource``   
             
            * ``eventName``   
             
            * ``eventCategory``   
             
            * ``resources.type``   
             
            * ``resources.ARN``   
             

             

            You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.

            
            

            - **Name** *(string) --* 

              An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector, such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              
            

            - **FieldSelectors** *(list) --* 

              Contains all selector statements in an advanced event selector.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A single selector statement in an advanced event selector.

                
                

                - **Field** *(string) --* 

                  A field in an event record on which to filter events to be logged. Supported fields include ``readOnly`` , ``eventCategory`` , ``eventSource`` (for management events), ``eventName`` , ``resources.type`` , and ``resources.ARN`` . 

                   

                   
                  * **``readOnly`` ** - Optional. Can be set to ``Equals`` a value of ``true`` or ``false`` . A value of ``false`` logs both ``read`` and ``write`` events. 
                   
                  * **``eventSource`` ** - For filtering management events only. This can be set only to ``NotEquals``  ``kms.amazonaws.com`` . 
                   
                  * **``eventName`` ** - Can use any operator. You can use it to ﬁlter in or ﬁlter out any data event logged to CloudTrail, such as ``PutBucket`` . You can have multiple values for this ﬁeld, separated by commas. 
                   
                  * **``eventCategory`` ** - This is required. It must be set to ``Equals`` , and the value must be ``Management`` or ``Data`` . 
                   
                  * **``resources.type`` ** - This ﬁeld is required. ``resources.type`` can only use the ``Equals`` operator, and the value can be one of the following: ``AWS::S3::Object`` , ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` , ``AWS::DynamoDB::Table`` , ``AWS::S3Outposts::Object`` , ``AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node`` , or ``AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint`` . You can have only one ``resources.type`` ﬁeld per selector. To log data events on more than one resource type, add another selector. 
                   
                  * **``resources.ARN`` ** - You can use any operator with resources.ARN, but if you use ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the value must exactly match the ARN of a valid resource of the type you've speciﬁed in the template as the value of resources.type. For example, if resources.type equals ``AWS::S3::Object`` , the ARN must be in one of the following formats. To log all data events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use the ``StartsWith`` operator, and include only the bucket ARN as the matching value. The trailing slash is intentional; do not exclude it. 

                     
                    * ``arn:partition:s3:::bucket_name/``   
                     
                    * ``arn:partition:s3:::bucket_name/object_or_file_name/``   
                     

                   

                  When resources.type equals ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

                   

                     
                    * ``arn:partition:lambda:region:account_ID:function:function_name``   
                     

                   

                  When resources.type equals ``AWS::DynamoDB::Table`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

                   

                     
                    * ``arn:partition:dynamodb:region:account_ID:table:table_name``   
                     

                   

                  When ``resources.type`` equals ``AWS::S3Outposts::Object`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

                   

                     
                    * ``arn:partition:s3-outposts:region:>account_ID:object_path``   
                     

                   

                  When ``resources.type`` equals ``AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

                   

                     
                    * ``arn:partition:managedblockchain:region:account_ID:nodes/node_ID``   
                     

                   

                  When ``resources.type`` equals ``AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint`` , and the operator is set to ``Equals`` or ``NotEquals`` , the ARN must be in the following format:

                   

                     
                    * ``arn:partition:s3-object-lambda:region:account_ID:accesspoint/access_point_name``   
                     

                   
                   

                  
                

                - **Equals** *(list) --* 

                  An operator that includes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . This is the only valid operator that you can use with the ``readOnly`` , ``eventCategory`` , and ``resources.type`` fields. 

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **StartsWith** *(list) --* 

                  An operator that includes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . 

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **EndsWith** *(list) --* 

                  An operator that includes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . 

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **NotEquals** *(list) --* 

                  An operator that excludes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` . 

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **NotStartsWith** *(list) --* 

                  An operator that excludes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field`` .

  .. py:method:: stop_logging(**kwargs)

    

    Suspends the recording of AWS API calls and log file delivery for the specified trail. Under most circumstances, there is no need to use this action. You can update a trail without stopping it first. This action is the only way to stop recording. For a trail enabled in all regions, this operation must be called from the region in which the trail was created, or an ``InvalidHomeRegionException`` will occur. This operation cannot be called on the shadow trails (replicated trails in other regions) of a trail enabled in all regions.

  .. py:method:: update_trail(**kwargs)

    

    Updates the settings that specify delivery of log files. Changes to a trail do not require stopping the CloudTrail service. Use this action to designate an existing bucket for log delivery. If the existing bucket has previously been a target for CloudTrail log files, an IAM policy exists for the bucket. ``UpdateTrail`` must be called from the region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an ``InvalidHomeRegionException`` is thrown.

    :type Name: string
    :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If ``Name`` is a trail name, the string must meet the following requirements:

       

       
      * Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (_), or dashes (-) 
       
      * Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number 
       
      * Be between 3 and 128 characters 
       
      * Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like ``my-_namespace`` and ``my--namespace`` are invalid. 
       
      * Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4) 
       

       

      If ``Name`` is a trail ARN, it must be in the format:

       

       ``arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail``  

      

    
    :type S3BucketName: string
    :param S3BucketName: 

      Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing log files. See `Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/create_trail_naming_policy.html>`__ .

      

    
    :type S3KeyPrefix: string
    :param S3KeyPrefix: 

      Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information, see `Finding Your CloudTrail Log Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-find-log-files.html>`__ . The maximum length is 200 characters.

      

    
    :type SnsTopicName: string
    :param SnsTopicName: 

      Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.

      

    
    :type IncludeGlobalServiceEvents: boolean
    :param IncludeGlobalServiceEvents: 

      Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from global services such as IAM to the log files.

      

    
    :type IsMultiRegionTrail: boolean
    :param IsMultiRegionTrail: 

      Specifies whether the trail applies only to the current region or to all regions. The default is false. If the trail exists only in the current region and this value is set to true, shadow trails (replications of the trail) will be created in the other regions. If the trail exists in all regions and this value is set to false, the trail will remain in the region where it was created, and its shadow trails in other regions will be deleted. As a best practice, consider using trails that log events in all regions.

      

    
    :type EnableLogFileValidation: boolean
    :param EnableLogFileValidation: 

      Specifies whether log file validation is enabled. The default is false.

       

      .. note::

         

        When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail will not create digest files for log files that were delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10. The same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.

         

      

    
    :type CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn: string
    :param CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn: 

      Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a unique identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will be delivered. Not required unless you specify CloudWatchLogsRoleArn.

      

    
    :type CloudWatchLogsRoleArn: string
    :param CloudWatchLogsRoleArn: 

      Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to write to a user's log group.

      

    
    :type KmsKeyId: string
    :param KmsKeyId: 

      Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by "alias/", a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.

       

      Examples:

       

       
      * alias/MyAliasName 
       
      * arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName 
       
      * arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 
       
      * 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 
       

      

    
    :type IsOrganizationTrail: boolean
    :param IsOrganizationTrail: 

      Specifies whether the trail is applied to all accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations, or only for the current AWS account. The default is false, and cannot be true unless the call is made on behalf of an AWS account that is the master account for an organization in AWS Organizations. If the trail is not an organization trail and this is set to true, the trail will be created in all AWS accounts that belong to the organization. If the trail is an organization trail and this is set to false, the trail will remain in the current AWS account but be deleted from all member accounts in the organization.
