.. py:class:: Detective.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon Detective
  

  Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services (AWS) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.

   

  The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.

   

  Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected endpoint.

   

  A Detective administrator account can use the Detective API to do the following:

   

   
  * Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph. 
   
  * View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph. 
   
  * Add member accounts to a behavior graph. 
   
  * Remove member accounts from a behavior graph. 
   

   

  A member account can use the Detective API to do the following:

   

   
  * View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to. 
   
  * Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph. 
   
  * Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph. 
   
  * Remove their account from a behavior graph. 
   

   

  All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See `Logging Detective API Calls with CloudTrail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html>`__ .

   

  .. note::

     

    We replaced the term "master account" with the term "administrator account." An administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts. In the case of Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in their behavior graph.

  .. py:method:: accept_invitation(**kwargs)

    

    Accepts an invitation for the member account to contribute data to a behavior graph. This operation can only be called by an invited member account. 

     

    The request provides the ARN of behavior graph.

     

    The member account status in the graph must be ``INVITED`` .

      response = client.accept_invitation(
          GraphArn='string'
      )
    :type GraphArn: string
    :param GraphArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ARN of the behavior graph that the member account is accepting the invitation for.

       

      The member account status in the behavior graph must be ``INVITED`` .

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: create_graph(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new behavior graph for the calling account, and sets that account as the administrator account. This operation is called by the account that is enabling Detective.

     

    Before you try to enable Detective, make sure that your account has been enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty for at least 48 hours. If you do not meet this requirement, you cannot enable Detective. If you do meet the GuardDuty prerequisite, then when you make the request to enable Detective, it checks whether your data volume is within the Detective quota. If it exceeds the quota, then you cannot enable Detective. 

     

    The operation also enables Detective for the calling account in the currently selected Region. It returns the ARN of the new behavior graph.

     

     ``CreateGraph`` triggers a process to create the corresponding data tables for the new behavior graph.

     

    An account can only be the administrator account for one behavior graph within a Region. If the same account calls ``CreateGraph`` with the same administrator account, it always returns the same behavior graph ARN. It does not create a new behavior graph.

  .. py:method:: create_members(**kwargs)

    

    Sends a request to invite the specified AWS accounts to be member accounts in the behavior graph. This operation can only be called by the administrator account for a behavior graph. 

     

     ``CreateMembers`` verifies the accounts and then invites the verified accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send invitation emails to the member accounts. This would be used when the administrator manages their member accounts centrally.

     

    The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to invite.

     

    The response separates the requested accounts into two lists:

     

     
    * The accounts that ``CreateMembers`` was able to start the verification for. This list includes member accounts that are being verified, that have passed verification and are to be invited, and that have failed verification. 
     
    * The accounts that ``CreateMembers`` was unable to process. This list includes accounts that were already invited to be member accounts in the behavior graph.

              * ``INVITED`` - Indicates that the member was sent an invitation but has not yet responded. 
               
              * ``VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS`` - Indicates that Detective is verifying that the account identifier and email address provided for the member account match. If they do match, then Detective sends the invitation. If the email address and account identifier don't match, then the member cannot be added to the behavior graph. 
               
              * ``VERIFICATION_FAILED`` - Indicates that the account and email address provided for the member account do not match, and Detective did not send an invitation to the account. 
               
              * ``ENABLED`` - Indicates that the member account accepted the invitation to contribute to the behavior graph. 
               
              * ``ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED`` - Indicates that the member account accepted the invitation but is prevented from contributing data to the behavior graph. ``DisabledReason`` provides the reason why the member account is not enabled. 
               

               

              Member accounts that declined an invitation or that were removed from the behavior graph are not included.

              
            

            - **DisabledReason** *(string) --* 

              For member accounts with a status of ``ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED`` , the reason that the member account is not enabled.

               

              The reason can have one of the following values:

               

               
              * ``VOLUME_TOO_HIGH`` - Indicates that adding the member account would cause the data volume for the behavior graph to be too high. 
               
              * ``VOLUME_UNKNOWN`` - Indicates that Detective is unable to verify the data volume for the member account. This is usually because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty.  
               

              
            

            - **InvitedTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time that Detective sent the invitation to the member account. The value is in milliseconds since the epoch.

              
            

            - **UpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time that the member account was last updated. The value is in milliseconds since the epoch.

              
            

            - **VolumeUsageInBytes** *(integer) --* 

              The data volume in bytes per day for the member account.

              
            

            - **VolumeUsageUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The data and time when the member account data volume was last updated.

              
            

            - **PercentOfGraphUtilization** *(float) --* 

              The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum allowed data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates 100 percent.

               

              Note that this is not the percentage of the behavior graph data volume.

               

              For example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80 GB per day. The maximum data volume is 160 GB per day. If the data volume for the member account is 40 GB per day, then ``PercentOfGraphUtilization`` is 25. It represents 25% of the maximum allowed data volume. 

              
            

            - **PercentOfGraphUtilizationUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --*

              * ``INVITED`` - Indicates that the member was sent an invitation but has not yet responded. 
               
              * ``VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS`` - Indicates that Detective is verifying that the account identifier and email address provided for the member account match. If they do match, then Detective sends the invitation. If the email address and account identifier don't match, then the member cannot be added to the behavior graph. 
               
              * ``VERIFICATION_FAILED`` - Indicates that the account and email address provided for the member account do not match, and Detective did not send an invitation to the account. 
               
              * ``ENABLED`` - Indicates that the member account accepted the invitation to contribute to the behavior graph. 
               
              * ``ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED`` - Indicates that the member account accepted the invitation but is prevented from contributing data to the behavior graph. ``DisabledReason`` provides the reason why the member account is not enabled. 
               

               

              Member accounts that declined an invitation or that were removed from the behavior graph are not included.

              
            

            - **DisabledReason** *(string) --* 

              For member accounts with a status of ``ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED`` , the reason that the member account is not enabled.

               

              The reason can have one of the following values:

               

               
              * ``VOLUME_TOO_HIGH`` - Indicates that adding the member account would cause the data volume for the behavior graph to be too high. 
               
              * ``VOLUME_UNKNOWN`` - Indicates that Detective is unable to verify the data volume for the member account. This is usually because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty.  
               

              
            

            - **InvitedTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time that Detective sent the invitation to the member account. The value is in milliseconds since the epoch.

              
            

            - **UpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time that the member account was last updated. The value is in milliseconds since the epoch.

              
            

            - **VolumeUsageInBytes** *(integer) --* 

              The data volume in bytes per day for the member account.

              
            

            - **VolumeUsageUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The data and time when the member account data volume was last updated.

              
            

            - **PercentOfGraphUtilization** *(float) --* 

              The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum allowed data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates 100 percent.

               

              Note that this is not the percentage of the behavior graph data volume.

               

              For example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80 GB per day. The maximum data volume is 160 GB per day. If the data volume for the member account is 40 GB per day, then ``PercentOfGraphUtilization`` is 25. It represents 25% of the maximum allowed data volume.

              * ``ENABLED`` - Indicates that the member account accepted the invitation to contribute to the behavior graph. 
               
              * ``ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED`` - Indicates that the member account accepted the invitation but is prevented from contributing data to the behavior graph. ``DisabledReason`` provides the reason why the member account is not enabled. 
               

               

              Member accounts that declined an invitation or that were removed from the behavior graph are not included.

              
            

            - **DisabledReason** *(string) --* 

              For member accounts with a status of ``ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED`` , the reason that the member account is not enabled.

               

              The reason can have one of the following values:

               

               
              * ``VOLUME_TOO_HIGH`` - Indicates that adding the member account would cause the data volume for the behavior graph to be too high. 
               
              * ``VOLUME_UNKNOWN`` - Indicates that Detective is unable to verify the data volume for the member account. This is usually because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty.  
               

              
            

            - **InvitedTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time that Detective sent the invitation to the member account. The value is in milliseconds since the epoch.

              
            

            - **UpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time that the member account was last updated. The value is in milliseconds since the epoch.

              
            

            - **VolumeUsageInBytes** *(integer) --*

              The data and time when the member account data volume was last updated.

              
            

            - **PercentOfGraphUtilization** *(float) --* 

              The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum allowed data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates 100 percent.

               

              Note that this is not the percentage of the behavior graph data volume.

               

              For example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80 GB per day. The maximum data volume is 160 GB per day. If the data volume for the member account is 40 GB per day, then ``PercentOfGraphUtilization`` is 25. It represents 25% of the maximum allowed data volume. 

              
            

            - **PercentOfGraphUtilizationUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time when the graph utilization percentage was last updated.

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          If there are more behavior graphs remaining in the results, then this is the pagination token to use to request the next page of behavior graphs.
