.. py:class:: SQS.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
  

  Welcome to the *Amazon SQS API Reference* .

   

  Amazon SQS is a reliable, highly-scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between applications or microservices. Amazon SQS moves data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components.

   

  For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see `Identity and access management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-authentication-and-access-control.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide.*  

   

  You can use `Amazon Web Services SDKs <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk>`__ to access Amazon SQS using your favorite programming language. The SDKs perform tasks such as the following automatically:

   

   
  * Cryptographically sign your service requests 
   
  * Retry requests 
   
  * Handle error responses

  .. py:method:: add_permission(**kwargs)

    

    Adds a permission to a queue for a specific `principal <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#P>`__ . This allows sharing access to the queue.

     

    When you create a queue, you have full control access rights for the queue. Only you, the owner of the queue, can grant or deny permissions to the queue. For more information about these permissions, see `Allow Developers to Write Messages to a Shared Queue <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-writing-an-sqs-policy.html#write-messages-to-shared-queue>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * ``AddPermission`` generates a policy for you. You can use ``  SetQueueAttributes `` to upload your policy. For more information, see `Using Custom Policies with the Amazon SQS Access Policy Language <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-creating-custom-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 
       
      * An Amazon SQS policy can have a maximum of 7 actions. 
       
      * To remove the ability to change queue permissions, you must deny permission to the ``AddPermission`` , ``RemovePermission`` , and ``SetQueueAttributes`` actions in your IAM policy. 
       

       

     

    Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the ``param.n`` notation. Values of ``n`` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

     

     ``&AttributeName.1=first``  

     

     ``&AttributeName.2=second``  

     

    .. note::

       

      Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see `Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a user name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples.html#grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

      )
    :type QueueUrl: string
    :param QueueUrl: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The URL of the Amazon SQS queue to which permissions are added.

       

      Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

      

    
    :type Label: string
    :param Label: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The unique identification of the permission you're setting (for example, ``AliceSendMessage`` ). Maximum 80 characters. Allowed characters include alphanumeric characters, hyphens (``-`` ), and underscores (``_`` ).

      

    
    :type AWSAccountIds: list
    :param AWSAccountIds: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The account numbers of the `principals <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#P>`__ who are to receive permission. For information about locating the account identification, see `Your Amazon Web Services Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-making-api-requests.html#sqs-api-request-authentication>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Actions: list
    :param Actions: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The action the client wants to allow for the specified principal. Valid values: the name of any action or ``*`` .

       

      For more information about these actions, see `Overview of Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon Simple Queue Service Resource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-overview-of-managing-access.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

       

      Specifying ``SendMessage`` , ``DeleteMessage`` , or ``ChangeMessageVisibility`` for ``ActionName.n`` also grants permissions for the corresponding batch versions of those actions: ``SendMessageBatch`` , ``DeleteMessageBatch`` , and ``ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch`` .

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: change_message_visibility(**kwargs)

    

    Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new value. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours. For more information, see `Visibility Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

     

    For example, you have a message with a visibility timeout of 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, you call ``ChangeMessageVisibility`` with a timeout of 10 minutes. You can continue to call ``ChangeMessageVisibility`` to extend the visibility timeout to the maximum allowed time. If you try to extend the visibility timeout beyond the maximum, your request is rejected.

     

    An Amazon SQS message has three basic states:

     

     
    * Sent to a queue by a producer. 
     
    * Received from the queue by a consumer. 
     
    * Deleted from the queue. 
     

     

    A message is considered to be *stored* after it is sent to a queue by a producer, but not yet received from the queue by a consumer (that is, between states 1 and 2). There is no limit to the number of stored messages. A message is considered to be *in flight* after it is received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue (that is, between states 2 and 3). There is a limit to the number of inflight messages.

     

    Limits that apply to inflight messages are unrelated to the *unlimited* number of stored messages.

     

    For most standard queues (depending on queue traffic and message backlog), there can be a maximum of approximately 120,000 inflight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the ``OverLimit`` error message. To avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages from the queue after they're processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process your messages. To request a limit increase, `file a support request <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-sqs>`__ .

     

    For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 20,000 inflight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error messages.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If you attempt to set the ``VisibilityTimeout`` to a value greater than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum remaining time.

       

      Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn't saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the original timeout value (not to the value you set using the ``ChangeMessageVisibility`` action) the next time the message is received.

    :type VisibilityTimeout: integer
    :param VisibilityTimeout: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The new value for the message's visibility timeout (in seconds). Values range: ``0`` to ``43200`` . Maximum: 12 hours.

  .. py:method:: change_message_visibility_batch(**kwargs)

    

    Changes the visibility timeout of multiple messages. This is a batch version of ``  ChangeMessageVisibility .`` The result of the action on each message is reported individually in the response. You can send up to 10 ``  ChangeMessageVisibility `` requests with each ``ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch`` action.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of ``200`` .

       

     

    Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the ``param.n`` notation. Values of ``n`` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

        Encloses a receipt handle and an entry id for each message in ``  ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch .``  

         

        .. warning::

           

          All of the following list parameters must be prefixed with ``ChangeMessageVisibilityBatchRequestEntry.n`` , where ``n`` is an integer value starting with ``1`` . For example, a parameter list for this action might look like this:

           

         

         ``&ChangeMessageVisibilityBatchRequestEntry.1.Id=change_visibility_msg_2``

          An identifier for this particular receipt handle used to communicate the result.

           

          .. note::

             

            The ``Id`` s of a batch request need to be unique within a request.

             

            This identifier can have up to 80 characters. The following characters are accepted: alphanumeric characters, hyphens(-), and underscores (_).

  .. py:method:: create_queue(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new standard or FIFO queue. You can pass one or more attributes in the request. Keep the following in mind:

     

     
    * If you don't specify the ``FifoQueue`` attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue. 

    .. note::

       You can't change the queue type after you create it and you can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. You must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue. For more information, see `Moving From a Standard Queue to a FIFO Queue <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html#FIFO-queues-moving>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .  

     
     
    * If you don't provide a value for an attribute, the queue is created with the default value for the attribute. 
     
    * If you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name. 
     

     

    To successfully create a new queue, you must provide a queue name that adheres to the `limits related to queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/limits-queues.html>`__ and is unique within the scope of your queues.

     

    .. note::

       

      After you create a queue, you must wait at least one second after the queue is created to be able to use the queue.

       

     

    To get the queue URL, use the ``  GetQueueUrl `` action. ``  GetQueueUrl `` requires only the ``QueueName`` parameter. be aware of existing queue names:

     

     
    * If you provide the name of an existing queue along with the exact names and values of all the queue's attributes, ``CreateQueue`` returns the queue URL for the existing queue. 
     
    * If the queue name, attribute names, or attribute values don't match an existing queue, ``CreateQueue`` returns an error. 
     

     

    Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the ``param.n`` notation. Values of ``n`` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

     

     ``&AttributeName.1=first``  

     

     ``&AttributeName.2=second``  

     

    .. note::

       

      Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see `Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a user name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples.html#grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

      * A queue name can have up to 80 characters. 
       
      * Valid values: alphanumeric characters, hyphens (``-`` ), and underscores (``_`` ). 
       
      * A FIFO queue name must end with the ``.fifo`` suffix. 
       

       

      Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

      

    
    :type Attributes: dict
    :param Attributes: 

      A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

       

      The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the ``CreateQueue`` action uses:

       

       
      * ``DelaySeconds`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Default: 0.  
       
      * ``MaximumMessageSize`` – The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default: 262,144 (256 KiB).  
       
      * ``MessageRetentionPeriod`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer from 60 seconds (1 minute) to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days).  
       
      * ``Policy`` – The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy. For more information about policy structure, see `Overview of Amazon Web Services IAM Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html>`__ in the *Amazon IAM User Guide* .  
       
      * ``ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which a ``  ReceiveMessage `` action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.  
       
      * ``RedrivePolicy`` – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. For more information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see `Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 

         
        * ``deadLetterTargetArn`` – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of ``maxReceiveCount`` is exceeded. 
         
        * ``maxReceiveCount`` – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. When the ``ReceiveCount`` for a message exceeds the ``maxReceiveCount`` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue. 
         

       

      .. note::

         

        The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.

         

       
       
      * ``VisibilityTimeout`` – The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see `Visibility Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `server-side-encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``KmsMasterKeyId`` – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see `Key Terms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-sse-key-terms>`__ . While the alias of the Amazon Web Services managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always ``alias/aws/sqs`` , the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be ``alias/*MyAlias* `` . For more examples, see `KeyId <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters>`__ in the *Key Management Service API Reference* .  
       
      * ``KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a `data key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys>`__ to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see `How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-how-does-the-data-key-reuse-period-work>`__ .  
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``FifoQueue`` – Designates a queue as FIFO. Valid values are ``true`` and ``false`` . If you don't specify the ``FifoQueue`` attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue. You can provide this attribute only during queue creation. You can't change it for an existing queue. When you set this attribute, you must also provide the ``MessageGroupId`` for your messages explicitly. For more information, see `FIFO queue logic <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-understanding-logic.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 
       
      * ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` – Enables content-based deduplication. Valid values are ``true`` and ``false`` . For more information, see `Exactly-once processing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . Note the following:  

         
        * Every message must have a unique ``MessageDeduplicationId`` . 

           
          * You may provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` explicitly. 
           
          * If you aren't able to provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and you enable ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).  
           
          * If you don't provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and the queue doesn't have ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, the action fails with an error. 
           
          * If the queue has ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, your ``MessageDeduplicationId`` overrides the generated one. 
           

         
         
        * When ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. 
         
        * If you send one message with ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` enabled and then another message with a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` that is the same as the one generated for the first ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.  
         

       
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `high throughput for FIFO queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/high-throughput-fifo.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``DeduplicationScope`` – Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are ``messageGroup`` and ``queue`` . 
       
      * ``FifoThroughputLimit`` – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are ``perQueue`` and ``perMessageGroupId`` . The ``perMessageGroupId`` value is allowed only when the value for ``DeduplicationScope`` is ``messageGroup`` . 
       

       

      To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:

       

       
      * Set ``DeduplicationScope`` to ``messageGroup`` . 
       
      * Set ``FifoThroughputLimit`` to ``perMessageGroupId`` . 
       

       

      If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified.

       

      For information on throughput quotas, see `Quotas related to messages <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

        - *(string) --* 

        
  

    :type tags: dict
    :param tags: 

      Add cost allocation tags to the specified Amazon SQS queue. For an overview, see `Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-tags.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

       

      When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:

       

       
      * Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended. 
       
      * Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags as character strings. 
       
      * Tags are case-sensitive. 
       
      * A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites the existing tag. 
       

       

      For a full list of tag restrictions, see `Quotas related to queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-limits.html#limits-queues>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

       

      .. note::

         

        To be able to tag a queue on creation, you must have the ``sqs:CreateQueue`` and ``sqs:TagQueue`` permissions.

         

        Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see `Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a user name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples.html#grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

  .. py:method:: delete_message(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. To select the message to delete, use the ``ReceiptHandle`` of the message (*not* the ``MessageId`` which you receive when you send the message). Amazon SQS can delete a message from a queue even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue longer than the retention period configured for the queue. 

     

    .. note::

       

      The ``ReceiptHandle`` is associated with a *specific instance* of receiving a message. If you receive a message more than once, the ``ReceiptHandle`` is different each time you receive a message. When you use the ``DeleteMessage`` action, you must provide the most recently received ``ReceiptHandle`` for the message (otherwise, the request succeeds, but the message might not be deleted).

       

      For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.

  .. py:method:: delete_message_batch(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes up to ten messages from the specified queue. This is a batch version of ``  DeleteMessage .`` The result of the action on each message is reported individually in the response.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of ``200`` .

       

     

    Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the ``param.n`` notation. Values of ``n`` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

     

     ``&AttributeName.1=first``  

     

     ``&AttributeName.2=second``

    :type AttributeNames: list
    :param AttributeNames: 

      A list of attributes for which to retrieve information.

       

      The ``AttributeName.N`` parameter is optional, but if you don't specify values for this parameter, the request returns empty results.

       

      .. note::

         

        In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.

         

       

      The following attributes are supported:

       

      .. warning::

         

        The ``ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed`` , ``ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible`` , and ``ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible`` metrics may not achieve consistency until at least 1 minute after the producers stop sending messages. This period is required for the queue metadata to reach eventual consistency. 

         

       

       
      * ``All`` – Returns all values.  
       
      * ``ApproximateNumberOfMessages`` – Returns the approximate number of messages available for retrieval from the queue. 
       
      * ``ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed`` – Returns the approximate number of messages in the queue that are delayed and not available for reading immediately. This can happen when the queue is configured as a delay queue or when a message has been sent with a delay parameter. 
       
      * ``ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible`` – Returns the approximate number of messages that are in flight. Messages are considered to be *in flight* if they have been sent to a client but have not yet been deleted or have not yet reached the end of their visibility window.  
       
      * ``CreatedTimestamp`` – Returns the time when the queue was created in seconds (`epoch time <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`__ ). 
       
      * ``DelaySeconds`` – Returns the default delay on the queue in seconds. 
       
      * ``LastModifiedTimestamp`` – Returns the time when the queue was last changed in seconds (`epoch time <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`__ ). 
       
      * ``MaximumMessageSize`` – Returns the limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. 
       
      * ``MessageRetentionPeriod`` – Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. 
       
      * ``Policy`` – Returns the policy of the queue. 
       
      * ``QueueArn`` – Returns the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the queue. 
       
      * ``ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds`` – Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which the ``ReceiveMessage`` action waits for a message to arrive.  
       
      * ``RedrivePolicy`` – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. For more information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see `Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 

         
        * ``deadLetterTargetArn`` – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of ``maxReceiveCount`` is exceeded. 
         
        * ``maxReceiveCount`` – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. When the ``ReceiveCount`` for a message exceeds the ``maxReceiveCount`` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue. 
         

       
       
      * ``VisibilityTimeout`` – Returns the visibility timeout for the queue. For more information about the visibility timeout, see `Visibility Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .  
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `server-side-encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``KmsMasterKeyId`` – Returns the ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see `Key Terms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-sse-key-terms>`__ .  
       
      * ``KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds`` – Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. For more information, see `How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-how-does-the-data-key-reuse-period-work>`__ .  
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``FifoQueue`` – Returns information about whether the queue is FIFO. For more information, see `FIFO queue logic <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-understanding-logic.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 

      .. note::

         To determine whether a queue is `FIFO <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html>`__ , you can check whether ``QueueName`` ends with the ``.fifo`` suffix. 

       
       
      * ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` – Returns whether content-based deduplication is enabled for the queue. For more information, see `Exactly-once processing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .  
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `high throughput for FIFO queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/high-throughput-fifo.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``DeduplicationScope`` – Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are ``messageGroup`` and ``queue`` . 
       
      * ``FifoThroughputLimit`` – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are ``perQueue`` and ``perMessageGroupId`` . The ``perMessageGroupId`` value is allowed only when the value for ``DeduplicationScope`` is ``messageGroup`` . 
       

       

      To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:

       

       
      * Set ``DeduplicationScope`` to ``messageGroup`` . 
       
      * Set ``FifoThroughputLimit`` to ``perMessageGroupId`` . 
       

       

      If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified.

       

      For information on throughput quotas, see `Quotas related to messages <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

      When you use the ``PurgeQueue`` action, you can't retrieve any messages deleted from a queue.

  .. py:method:: receive_message(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves one or more messages (up to 10), from the specified queue. Using the ``WaitTimeSeconds`` parameter enables long-poll support. For more information, see `Amazon SQS Long Polling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 

     

    Short poll is the default behavior where a weighted random set of machines is sampled on a ``ReceiveMessage`` call. Thus, only the messages on the sampled machines are returned. If the number of messages in the queue is small (fewer than 1,000), you most likely get fewer messages than you requested per ``ReceiveMessage`` call. If the number of messages in the queue is extremely small, you might not receive any messages in a particular ``ReceiveMessage`` response. If this happens, repeat the request. 

     

    For each message returned, the response includes the following:

     

     
    * The message body. 
     
    * An MD5 digest of the message body. For information about MD5, see `RFC1321 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt>`__ . 
     
    * The ``MessageId`` you received when you sent the message to the queue. 
     
    * The receipt handle. 
     
    * The message attributes. 
     
    * An MD5 digest of the message attributes. 
     

     

    The receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the message. For more information, see `Queue and Message Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-message-identifiers.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

     

    You can provide the ``VisibilityTimeout`` parameter in your request. The parameter is applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the response. If you don't include the parameter, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is used for the returned messages. For more information, see `Visibility Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

     

    A message that isn't deleted or a message whose visibility isn't extended before the visibility timeout expires counts as a failed receive. Depending on the configuration of the queue, the message might be sent to the dead-letter queue.

     

    .. note::

       

      In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.

    :type AttributeNames: list
    :param AttributeNames: 

      A list of attributes that need to be returned along with each message. These attributes include:

       

       
      * ``All`` – Returns all values. 
       
      * ``ApproximateFirstReceiveTimestamp`` – Returns the time the message was first received from the queue (`epoch time <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`__ in milliseconds). 
       
      * ``ApproximateReceiveCount`` – Returns the number of times a message has been received across all queues but not deleted. 
       
      * ``AWSTraceHeader`` – Returns the X-Ray trace header string.  
       
      * ``SenderId``   

         
        * For an IAM user, returns the IAM user ID, for example ``ABCDEFGHI1JKLMNOPQ23R`` . 
         
        * For an IAM role, returns the IAM role ID, for example ``ABCDE1F2GH3I4JK5LMNOP:i-a123b456`` . 
         

       
       
      * ``SentTimestamp`` – Returns the time the message was sent to the queue (`epoch time <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`__ in milliseconds). 
       
      * ``MessageDeduplicationId`` – Returns the value provided by the producer that calls the ``  SendMessage `` action. 
       
      * ``MessageGroupId`` – Returns the value provided by the producer that calls the ``  SendMessage `` action. Messages with the same ``MessageGroupId`` are returned in sequence. 
       
      * ``SequenceNumber`` – Returns the value provided by Amazon SQS. 
       

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type MessageAttributeNames: list
    :param MessageAttributeNames: 

      The name of the message attribute, where *N* is the index.

       

       
      * The name can contain alphanumeric characters and the underscore (``_`` ), hyphen (``-`` ), and period (``.`` ). 
       
      * The name is case-sensitive and must be unique among all attribute names for the message. 
       
      * The name must not start with AWS-reserved prefixes such as ``AWS.`` or ``Amazon.`` (or any casing variants). 
       
      * The name must not start or end with a period (``.`` ), and it should not have periods in succession (``..`` ). 
       
      * The name can be up to 256 characters long. 
       

       

      When using ``ReceiveMessage`` , you can send a list of attribute names to receive, or you can return all of the attributes by specifying ``All`` or ``.*`` in your request. You can also use all message attributes starting with a prefix, for example ``bar.*`` .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type MaxNumberOfMessages: integer
    :param MaxNumberOfMessages: 

      The maximum number of messages to return. Amazon SQS never returns more messages than this value (however, fewer messages might be returned). Valid values: 1 to 10. Default: 1.

      

    
    :type VisibilityTimeout: integer
    :param VisibilityTimeout: 

      The duration (in seconds) that the received messages are hidden from subsequent retrieve requests after being retrieved by a ``ReceiveMessage`` request.

      

    
    :type WaitTimeSeconds: integer
    :param WaitTimeSeconds: 

      The duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a message to arrive in the queue before returning. If a message is available, the call returns sooner than ``WaitTimeSeconds`` . If no messages are available and the wait time expires, the call returns successfully with an empty list of messages.

       

      .. warning::

         

        To avoid HTTP errors, ensure that the HTTP response timeout for ``ReceiveMessage`` requests is longer than the ``WaitTimeSeconds`` parameter. For example, with the Java SDK, you can set HTTP transport settings using the `NettyNioAsyncHttpClient <https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/http/nio/netty/NettyNioAsyncHttpClient.html>`__ for asynchronous clients, or the `ApacheHttpClient <https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/http/apache/ApacheHttpClient.html>`__ for synchronous clients. 

         

      

    
    :type ReceiveRequestAttemptId: string
    :param ReceiveRequestAttemptId: 

      This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

       

      The token used for deduplication of ``ReceiveMessage`` calls. If a networking issue occurs after a ``ReceiveMessage`` action, and instead of a response you receive a generic error, it is possible to retry the same action with an identical ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` to retrieve the same set of messages, even if their visibility timeout has not yet expired.

       

       
      * You can use ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` only for 5 minutes after a ``ReceiveMessage`` action. 
       
      * When you set ``FifoQueue`` , a caller of the ``ReceiveMessage`` action can provide a ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` explicitly. 
       
      * If a caller of the ``ReceiveMessage`` action doesn't provide a ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` , Amazon SQS generates a ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` . 
       
      * It is possible to retry the ``ReceiveMessage`` action with the same ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` if none of the messages have been modified (deleted or had their visibility changes). 
       
      * During a visibility timeout, subsequent calls with the same ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` return the same messages and receipt handles. If a retry occurs within the deduplication interval, it resets the visibility timeout. For more information, see `Visibility Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 

      .. warning::

         If a caller of the ``ReceiveMessage`` action still processes messages when the visibility timeout expires and messages become visible, another worker consuming from the same queue can receive the same messages and therefore process duplicates. Also, if a consumer whose message processing time is longer than the visibility timeout tries to delete the processed messages, the action fails with an error. To mitigate this effect, ensure that your application observes a safe threshold before the visibility timeout expires and extend the visibility timeout as necessary. 

       
       
      * While messages with a particular ``MessageGroupId`` are invisible, no more messages belonging to the same ``MessageGroupId`` are returned until the visibility timeout expires. You can still receive messages with another ``MessageGroupId`` as long as it is also visible. 
       
      * If a caller of ``ReceiveMessage`` can't track the ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` , no retries work until the original visibility timeout expires. As a result, delays might occur but the messages in the queue remain in a strict order. 
       

       

      The maximum length of ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` is 128 characters. ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` can contain alphanumeric characters (``a-z`` , ``A-Z`` , ``0-9`` ) and punctuation (``!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~`` ).

       

      For best practices of using ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` , see `Using the ReceiveRequestAttemptId Request Parameter <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-receiverequestattemptid-request-parameter.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

            - **MD5OfMessageAttributes** *(string) --* 

              An MD5 digest of the non-URL-encoded message attribute string. You can use this attribute to verify that Amazon SQS received the message correctly. Amazon SQS URL-decodes the message before creating the MD5 digest. For information about MD5, see `RFC1321 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt>`__ .

              
            

            - **MessageAttributes** *(dict) --* 

              Each message attribute consists of a ``Name`` , ``Type`` , and ``Value`` . For more information, see `Amazon SQS message attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-message-metadata.html#sqs-message-attributes>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  The user-specified message attribute value. For string data types, the ``Value`` attribute has the same restrictions on the content as the message body. For more information, see ``  SendMessage .``  

                   

                   ``Name`` , ``type`` , ``value`` and the message body must not be empty or null. All parts of the message attribute, including ``Name`` , ``Type`` , and ``Value`` , are part of the message size restriction (256 KB or 262,144 bytes).

                  
                  

                  - **StringValue** *(string) --* 

                    Strings are Unicode with UTF-8 binary encoding. For a list of code values, see `ASCII Printable Characters <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters>`__ .

                    
                  

                  - **BinaryValue** *(bytes) --* 

                    Binary type attributes can store any binary data, such as compressed data, encrypted data, or images.

    :type MessageDeduplicationId: string
    :param MessageDeduplicationId: 

      This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

       

      The token used for deduplication of sent messages. If a message with a particular ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is sent successfully, any messages sent with the same ``MessageDeduplicationId`` are accepted successfully but aren't delivered during the 5-minute deduplication interval. For more information, see `Exactly-once processing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

       

       
      * Every message must have a unique ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , 

         
        * You may provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` explicitly. 
         
        * If you aren't able to provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and you enable ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).  
         
        * If you don't provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and the queue doesn't have ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, the action fails with an error. 
         
        * If the queue has ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, your ``MessageDeduplicationId`` overrides the generated one. 
         

       
       
      * When ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. 
       
      * If you send one message with ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` enabled and then another message with a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` that is the same as the one generated for the first ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.  
       

       

      .. note::

         

        The ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is available to the consumer of the message (this can be useful for troubleshooting delivery issues).

         

        If a message is sent successfully but the acknowledgement is lost and the message is resent with the same ``MessageDeduplicationId`` after the deduplication interval, Amazon SQS can't detect duplicate messages.

         

        Amazon SQS continues to keep track of the message deduplication ID even after the message is received and deleted.

         

       

      The maximum length of ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is 128 characters. ``MessageDeduplicationId`` can contain alphanumeric characters (``a-z`` , ``A-Z`` , ``0-9`` ) and punctuation (``!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~`` ).

       

      For best practices of using ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , see `Using the MessageDeduplicationId Property <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagededuplicationid-property.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

      

    
    :type MessageGroupId: string
    :param MessageGroupId: 

      This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

       

      The tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different message groups might be processed out of order). To interleave multiple ordered streams within a single queue, use ``MessageGroupId`` values (for example, session data for multiple users). In this scenario, multiple consumers can process the queue, but the session data of each user is processed in a FIFO fashion.

       

       
      * You must associate a non-empty ``MessageGroupId`` with a message. If you don't provide a ``MessageGroupId`` , the action fails. 
       
      * ``ReceiveMessage`` might return messages with multiple ``MessageGroupId`` values. For each ``MessageGroupId`` , the messages are sorted by time sent. The caller can't specify a ``MessageGroupId`` . 
       

       

      The length of ``MessageGroupId`` is 128 characters. Valid values: alphanumeric characters and punctuation ``(!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~)`` .

       

      For best practices of using ``MessageGroupId`` , see `Using the MessageGroupId Property <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagegroupid-property.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

       

      .. warning::

         

         ``MessageGroupId`` is required for FIFO queues. You can't use it for Standard queues.

  .. py:method:: send_message_batch(**kwargs)

    

    Delivers up to ten messages to the specified queue. This is a batch version of ``  SendMessage .`` For a FIFO queue, multiple messages within a single batch are enqueued in the order they are sent.

     

    The result of sending each message is reported individually in the response. Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of ``200`` .

     

    The maximum allowed individual message size and the maximum total payload size (the sum of the individual lengths of all of the batched messages) are both 256 KB (262,144 bytes).

     

    .. warning::

       

      A message can include only XML, JSON, and unformatted text. The following Unicode characters are allowed:

       

       ``#x9`` | ``#xA`` | ``#xD`` | ``#x20`` to ``#xD7FF`` | ``#xE000`` to ``#xFFFD`` | ``#x10000`` to ``#x10FFFF``  

       

      Any characters not included in this list will be rejected. For more information, see the `W3C specification for characters <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charsets>`__ .

       

     

    If you don't specify the ``DelaySeconds`` parameter for an entry, Amazon SQS uses the default value for the queue.

     

    Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the ``param.n`` notation. Values of ``n`` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

     

     ``&AttributeName.1=first``  

     

     ``&AttributeName.2=second``

               ``Name`` , ``type`` , ``value`` and the message body must not be empty or null.

              

            
              - **StringValue** *(string) --* 

                Strings are Unicode with UTF-8 binary encoding. For a list of code values, see `ASCII Printable Characters <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters>`__ .

                

              
              - **BinaryValue** *(bytes) --* 

                Binary type attributes can store any binary data, such as compressed data, encrypted data, or images.

                

              
              - **StringListValues** *(list) --* 

                Not implemented. Reserved for future use.

              - **DataType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                Amazon SQS supports the following logical data types: ``String`` , ``Number`` , and ``Binary`` . For the ``Number`` data type, you must use ``StringValue`` .

                 

                You can also append custom labels. For more information, see `Amazon SQS Message Attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-message-metadata.html#sqs-message-attributes>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

                

              
            
      
    
        - **MessageDeduplicationId** *(string) --* 

          This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

           

          The token used for deduplication of messages within a 5-minute minimum deduplication interval. If a message with a particular ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is sent successfully, subsequent messages with the same ``MessageDeduplicationId`` are accepted successfully but aren't delivered. For more information, see `Exactly-once processing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

           

           
          * Every message must have a unique ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , 

             
            * You may provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` explicitly. 
             
            * If you aren't able to provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and you enable ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).  
             
            * If you don't provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and the queue doesn't have ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, the action fails with an error. 
             
            * If the queue has ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, your ``MessageDeduplicationId`` overrides the generated one. 
             

           
           
          * When ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. 
           
          * If you send one message with ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` enabled and then another message with a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` that is the same as the one generated for the first ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.  
           

           

          .. note::

             

            The ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is available to the consumer of the message (this can be useful for troubleshooting delivery issues).

             

            If a message is sent successfully but the acknowledgement is lost and the message is resent with the same ``MessageDeduplicationId`` after the deduplication interval, Amazon SQS can't detect duplicate messages.

             

            Amazon SQS continues to keep track of the message deduplication ID even after the message is received and deleted.

             

           

          The length of ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is 128 characters. ``MessageDeduplicationId`` can contain alphanumeric characters (``a-z`` , ``A-Z`` , ``0-9`` ) and punctuation (``!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~`` ).

           

          For best practices of using ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , see `Using the MessageDeduplicationId Property <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagededuplicationid-property.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

          

        
        - **MessageGroupId** *(string) --* 

          This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

           

          The tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different message groups might be processed out of order). To interleave multiple ordered streams within a single queue, use ``MessageGroupId`` values (for example, session data for multiple users). In this scenario, multiple consumers can process the queue, but the session data of each user is processed in a FIFO fashion.

           

           
          * You must associate a non-empty ``MessageGroupId`` with a message. If you don't provide a ``MessageGroupId`` , the action fails. 
           
          * ``ReceiveMessage`` might return messages with multiple ``MessageGroupId`` values. For each ``MessageGroupId`` , the messages are sorted by time sent. The caller can't specify a ``MessageGroupId`` . 
           

           

          The length of ``MessageGroupId`` is 128 characters. Valid values: alphanumeric characters and punctuation ``(!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~)`` .

           

          For best practices of using ``MessageGroupId`` , see `Using the MessageGroupId Property <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagegroupid-property.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

           

          .. warning::

             

             ``MessageGroupId`` is required for FIFO queues. You can't use it for Standard queues.

  .. py:method:: set_queue_attributes(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the value of one or more queue attributes. When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the ``MessageRetentionPeriod`` attribute can take up to 15 minutes.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully. 
       
      * Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action.

      )
    :type QueueUrl: string
    :param QueueUrl: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The URL of the Amazon SQS queue whose attributes are set.

       

      Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

      

    
    :type Attributes: dict
    :param Attributes: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A map of attributes to set.

       

      The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the ``SetQueueAttributes`` action uses:

       

       
      * ``DelaySeconds`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 (15 minutes). Default: 0.  
       
      * ``MaximumMessageSize`` – The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) up to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default: 262,144 (256 KiB).  
       
      * ``MessageRetentionPeriod`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer representing seconds, from 60 (1 minute) to 1,209,600 (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days).  
       
      * ``Policy`` – The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy. For more information about policy structure, see `Overview of Amazon Web Services IAM Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html>`__ in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide* .  
       
      * ``ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which a ``  ReceiveMessage `` action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.  
       
      * ``RedrivePolicy`` – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. For more information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see `Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 

         
        * ``deadLetterTargetArn`` – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of ``maxReceiveCount`` is exceeded. 
         
        * ``maxReceiveCount`` – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. When the ``ReceiveCount`` for a message exceeds the ``maxReceiveCount`` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue. 
         

       

      .. note::

         

        The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.

         

       
       
      * ``VisibilityTimeout`` – The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see `Visibility Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `server-side-encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``KmsMasterKeyId`` – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see `Key Terms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-sse-key-terms>`__ . While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always ``alias/aws/sqs`` , the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be ``alias/*MyAlias* `` . For more examples, see `KeyId <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters>`__ in the *Key Management Service API Reference* .  
       
      * ``KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a `data key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys>`__ to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see `How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-how-does-the-data-key-reuse-period-work>`__ .  
       

       

      The following attribute applies only to `FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` – Enables content-based deduplication. For more information, see `Exactly-once processing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . Note the following:  

         
        * Every message must have a unique ``MessageDeduplicationId`` . 

           
          * You may provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` explicitly. 
           
          * If you aren't able to provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and you enable ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).

          * If the queue has ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, your ``MessageDeduplicationId`` overrides the generated one. 
           

         
         
        * When ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. 
         
        * If you send one message with ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` enabled and then another message with a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` that is the same as the one generated for the first ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.  
         

       
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `high throughput for FIFO queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/high-throughput-fifo.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``DeduplicationScope`` – Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are ``messageGroup`` and ``queue`` . 
       
      * ``FifoThroughputLimit`` – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are ``perQueue`` and ``perMessageGroupId`` . The ``perMessageGroupId`` value is allowed only when the value for ``DeduplicationScope`` is ``messageGroup`` . 
       

       

      To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:

       

       
      * Set ``DeduplicationScope`` to ``messageGroup`` . 
       
      * Set ``FifoThroughputLimit`` to ``perMessageGroupId`` . 
       

       

      If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified.

       

      For information on throughput quotas, see `Quotas related to messages <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

    When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:

     

     
    * Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended. 
     
    * Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags as character strings. 
     
    * Tags are case-sensitive. 
     
    * A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites the existing tag.

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: create_queue(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new standard or FIFO queue. You can pass one or more attributes in the request. Keep the following in mind:

     

     
    * If you don't specify the ``FifoQueue`` attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue. 

    .. note::

       You can't change the queue type after you create it and you can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. You must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue. For more information, see `Moving From a Standard Queue to a FIFO Queue <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html#FIFO-queues-moving>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .  

     
     
    * If you don't provide a value for an attribute, the queue is created with the default value for the attribute. 
     
    * If you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name. 
     

     

    To successfully create a new queue, you must provide a queue name that adheres to the `limits related to queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/limits-queues.html>`__ and is unique within the scope of your queues.

     

    .. note::

       

      After you create a queue, you must wait at least one second after the queue is created to be able to use the queue.

       

     

    To get the queue URL, use the ``  GetQueueUrl `` action. ``  GetQueueUrl `` requires only the ``QueueName`` parameter. be aware of existing queue names:

     

     
    * If you provide the name of an existing queue along with the exact names and values of all the queue's attributes, ``CreateQueue`` returns the queue URL for the existing queue. 
     
    * If the queue name, attribute names, or attribute values don't match an existing queue, ``CreateQueue`` returns an error. 
     

     

    Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the ``param.n`` notation. Values of ``n`` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

     

     ``&AttributeName.1=first``  

     

     ``&AttributeName.2=second``  

     

    .. note::

       

      Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action.

      The name of the new queue. The following limits apply to this name:

       

       
      * A queue name can have up to 80 characters. 
       
      * Valid values: alphanumeric characters, hyphens (``-`` ), and underscores (``_`` ). 
       
      * A FIFO queue name must end with the ``.fifo`` suffix.

      A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

       

      The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the ``CreateQueue`` action uses:

       

       
      * ``DelaySeconds`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Default: 0.  
       
      * ``MaximumMessageSize`` – The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default: 262,144 (256 KiB).  
       
      * ``MessageRetentionPeriod`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer from 60 seconds (1 minute) to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days).  
       
      * ``Policy`` – The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy. For more information about policy structure, see `Overview of Amazon Web Services IAM Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html>`__ in the *Amazon IAM User Guide* .  
       
      * ``ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which a ``  ReceiveMessage `` action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.  
       
      * ``RedrivePolicy`` – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. For more information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see `Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 

         
        * ``deadLetterTargetArn`` – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of ``maxReceiveCount`` is exceeded. 
         
        * ``maxReceiveCount`` – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. When the ``ReceiveCount`` for a message exceeds the ``maxReceiveCount`` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue. 
         

       

      .. note::

         

        The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.

         

       
       
      * ``VisibilityTimeout`` – The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see `Visibility Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `server-side-encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``KmsMasterKeyId`` – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see `Key Terms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-sse-key-terms>`__ . While the alias of the Amazon Web Services managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always ``alias/aws/sqs`` , the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be ``alias/*MyAlias* `` . For more examples, see `KeyId <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters>`__ in the *Key Management Service API Reference* .  
       
      * ``KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a `data key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys>`__ to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see `How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-how-does-the-data-key-reuse-period-work>`__ .  
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``FifoQueue`` – Designates a queue as FIFO. Valid values are ``true`` and ``false`` . If you don't specify the ``FifoQueue`` attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue. You can provide this attribute only during queue creation. You can't change it for an existing queue. When you set this attribute, you must also provide the ``MessageGroupId`` for your messages explicitly. For more information, see `FIFO queue logic <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-understanding-logic.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 
       
      * ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` – Enables content-based deduplication. Valid values are ``true`` and ``false`` . For more information, see `Exactly-once processing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . Note the following:  

         
        * Every message must have a unique ``MessageDeduplicationId`` . 

           
          * You may provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` explicitly. 
           
          * If you aren't able to provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and you enable ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).  
           
          * If you don't provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and the queue doesn't have ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, the action fails with an error. 
           
          * If the queue has ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, your ``MessageDeduplicationId`` overrides the generated one. 
           

         
         
        * When ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. 
         
        * If you send one message with ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` enabled and then another message with a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` that is the same as the one generated for the first ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.  
         

       
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `high throughput for FIFO queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/high-throughput-fifo.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``DeduplicationScope`` – Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are ``messageGroup`` and ``queue`` . 
       
      * ``FifoThroughputLimit`` – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are ``perQueue`` and ``perMessageGroupId`` . The ``perMessageGroupId`` value is allowed only when the value for ``DeduplicationScope`` is ``messageGroup`` . 
       

       

      To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:

       

       
      * Set ``DeduplicationScope`` to ``messageGroup`` . 
       
      * Set ``FifoThroughputLimit`` to ``perMessageGroupId`` . 
       

       

      If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified.

       

      For information on throughput quotas, see `Quotas related to messages <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

      When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:

       

       
      * Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended. 
       
      * Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags as character strings.

        - *(string) --* 
  


  .. py:attribute:: body

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The message's contents (not URL-encoded).

      

  .. py:attribute:: md5_of_body

    

    - *(string) --* 

      An MD5 digest of the non-URL-encoded message body string.

      

  .. py:attribute:: md5_of_message_attributes

    

    - *(string) --* 

      An MD5 digest of the non-URL-encoded message attribute string. You can use this attribute to verify that Amazon SQS received the message correctly. Amazon SQS URL-decodes the message before creating the MD5 digest. For information about MD5, see `RFC1321 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt>`__ .

      

  .. py:attribute:: message_attributes

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Each message attribute consists of a ``Name`` , ``Type`` , and ``Value`` . For more information, see `Amazon SQS message attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-message-metadata.html#sqs-message-attributes>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

      
      

      - *(string) --* 
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          The user-specified message attribute value. For string data types, the ``Value`` attribute has the same restrictions on the content as the message body. For more information, see ``  SendMessage .``  

           

           ``Name`` , ``type`` , ``value`` and the message body must not be empty or null. All parts of the message attribute, including ``Name`` , ``Type`` , and ``Value`` , are part of the message size restriction (256 KB or 262,144 bytes).

          
          

          - **StringValue** *(string) --* 

            Strings are Unicode with UTF-8 binary encoding. For a list of code values, see `ASCII Printable Characters <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters>`__ .

            
          

          - **BinaryValue** *(bytes) --* 

            Binary type attributes can store any binary data, such as compressed data, encrypted data, or images.

            
          

          - **StringListValues** *(list) --* 

            Not implemented. Reserved for future use.

          - **DataType** *(string) --* 

            Amazon SQS supports the following logical data types: ``String`` , ``Number`` , and ``Binary`` . For the ``Number`` data type, you must use ``StringValue`` .

             

            You can also append custom labels. For more information, see `Amazon SQS Message Attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-message-metadata.html#sqs-message-attributes>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

            
      
  


  .. py:attribute:: message_id

    

    - *(string) --* 

      A unique identifier for the message. A ``MessageId`` is considered unique across all accounts for an extended period of time.

      
  .. rst-class:: admonition-title
  
  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: change_visibility(**kwargs)

    

    Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new value. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours. For more information, see `Visibility Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

     

    For example, you have a message with a visibility timeout of 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, you call ``ChangeMessageVisibility`` with a timeout of 10 minutes. You can continue to call ``ChangeMessageVisibility`` to extend the visibility timeout to the maximum allowed time. If you try to extend the visibility timeout beyond the maximum, your request is rejected.

     

    An Amazon SQS message has three basic states:

     

     
    * Sent to a queue by a producer. 
     
    * Received from the queue by a consumer. 
     
    * Deleted from the queue. 
     

     

    A message is considered to be *stored* after it is sent to a queue by a producer, but not yet received from the queue by a consumer (that is, between states 1 and 2). There is no limit to the number of stored messages. A message is considered to be *in flight* after it is received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue (that is, between states 2 and 3). There is a limit to the number of inflight messages.

     

    Limits that apply to inflight messages are unrelated to the *unlimited* number of stored messages.

     

    For most standard queues (depending on queue traffic and message backlog), there can be a maximum of approximately 120,000 inflight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the ``OverLimit`` error message. To avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages from the queue after they're processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process your messages. To request a limit increase, `file a support request <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-sqs>`__ .

     

    For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 20,000 inflight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error messages.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If you attempt to set the ``VisibilityTimeout`` to a value greater than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum remaining time.

       

      Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn't saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the original timeout value (not to the value you set using the ``ChangeMessageVisibility`` action) the next time the message is received.

    :param VisibilityTimeout: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The new value for the message's visibility timeout (in seconds). Values range: ``0`` to ``43200`` . Maximum: 12 hours.

      

    
    
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: delete()

    

    Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. To select the message to delete, use the ``ReceiptHandle`` of the message (*not* the ``MessageId`` which you receive when you send the message). Amazon SQS can delete a message from a queue even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue longer than the retention period configured for the queue. 

     

    .. note::

       

      The ``ReceiptHandle`` is associated with a *specific instance* of receiving a message. If you receive a message more than once, the ``ReceiptHandle`` is different each time you receive a message. When you use the ``DeleteMessage`` action, you must provide the most recently received ``ReceiptHandle`` for the message (otherwise, the request succeeds, but the message might not be deleted).

       

      For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.

  .. py:method:: add_permission(**kwargs)

    

    Adds a permission to a queue for a specific `principal <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#P>`__ . This allows sharing access to the queue.

     

    When you create a queue, you have full control access rights for the queue. Only you, the owner of the queue, can grant or deny permissions to the queue. For more information about these permissions, see `Allow Developers to Write Messages to a Shared Queue <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-writing-an-sqs-policy.html#write-messages-to-shared-queue>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * ``AddPermission`` generates a policy for you. You can use ``  SetQueueAttributes `` to upload your policy. For more information, see `Using Custom Policies with the Amazon SQS Access Policy Language <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-creating-custom-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 
       
      * An Amazon SQS policy can have a maximum of 7 actions. 
       
      * To remove the ability to change queue permissions, you must deny permission to the ``AddPermission`` , ``RemovePermission`` , and ``SetQueueAttributes`` actions in your IAM policy. 
       

       

     

    Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the ``param.n`` notation. Values of ``n`` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

     

     ``&AttributeName.1=first``  

     

     ``&AttributeName.2=second``

  .. py:method:: change_message_visibility_batch(**kwargs)

    

    Changes the visibility timeout of multiple messages. This is a batch version of ``  ChangeMessageVisibility .`` The result of the action on each message is reported individually in the response. You can send up to 10 ``  ChangeMessageVisibility `` requests with each ``ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch`` action.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of ``200`` .

       

     

    Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the ``param.n`` notation. Values of ``n`` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

     

     ``&AttributeName.1=first``  

     

     ``&AttributeName.2=second``

    Deletes the queue specified by the ``QueueUrl`` , regardless of the queue's contents.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Be careful with the ``DeleteQueue`` action: When you delete a queue, any messages in the queue are no longer available. 

       

     

    When you delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. Requests you send involving that queue during the 60 seconds might succeed. For example, a ``  SendMessage `` request might succeed, but after 60 seconds the queue and the message you sent no longer exist.

     

    When you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name.

    Deletes the messages in a queue specified by the ``QueueURL`` parameter.

     

    .. warning::

       

      When you use the ``PurgeQueue`` action, you can't retrieve any messages deleted from a queue.

       

      The message deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. We recommend waiting for 60 seconds regardless of your queue's size. 

       

     

    Messages sent to the queue *before* you call ``PurgeQueue`` might be received but are deleted within the next minute.

     

    Messages sent to the queue *after* you call ``PurgeQueue`` might be deleted while the queue is being purged.

  .. py:method:: receive_messages(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves one or more messages (up to 10), from the specified queue. Using the ``WaitTimeSeconds`` parameter enables long-poll support. For more information, see `Amazon SQS Long Polling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 

     

    Short poll is the default behavior where a weighted random set of machines is sampled on a ``ReceiveMessage`` call. Thus, only the messages on the sampled machines are returned. If the number of messages in the queue is small (fewer than 1,000), you most likely get fewer messages than you requested per ``ReceiveMessage`` call. If the number of messages in the queue is extremely small, you might not receive any messages in a particular ``ReceiveMessage`` response. If this happens, repeat the request. 

     

    For each message returned, the response includes the following:

     

     
    * The message body. 
     
    * An MD5 digest of the message body. For information about MD5, see `RFC1321 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt>`__ . 
     
    * The ``MessageId`` you received when you sent the message to the queue. 
     
    * The receipt handle. 
     
    * The message attributes. 
     
    * An MD5 digest of the message attributes. 
     

     

    The receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the message. For more information, see `Queue and Message Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-message-identifiers.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

     

    You can provide the ``VisibilityTimeout`` parameter in your request. The parameter is applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the response. If you don't include the parameter, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is used for the returned messages. For more information, see `Visibility Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

     

    A message that isn't deleted or a message whose visibility isn't extended before the visibility timeout expires counts as a failed receive. Depending on the configuration of the queue, the message might be sent to the dead-letter queue.

     

    .. note::

       

      In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.

      When using ``ReceiveMessage`` , you can send a list of attribute names to receive, or you can return all of the attributes by specifying ``All`` or ``.*`` in your request. You can also use all message attributes starting with a prefix, for example ``bar.*`` .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type MaxNumberOfMessages: integer
    :param MaxNumberOfMessages: 

      The maximum number of messages to return. Amazon SQS never returns more messages than this value (however, fewer messages might be returned). Valid values: 1 to 10. Default: 1.

      

    
    :type VisibilityTimeout: integer
    :param VisibilityTimeout: 

      The duration (in seconds) that the received messages are hidden from subsequent retrieve requests after being retrieved by a ``ReceiveMessage`` request.

      

    
    :type WaitTimeSeconds: integer
    :param WaitTimeSeconds: 

      The duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a message to arrive in the queue before returning. If a message is available, the call returns sooner than ``WaitTimeSeconds`` . If no messages are available and the wait time expires, the call returns successfully with an empty list of messages.

       

      .. warning::

         

        To avoid HTTP errors, ensure that the HTTP response timeout for ``ReceiveMessage`` requests is longer than the ``WaitTimeSeconds`` parameter. For example, with the Java SDK, you can set HTTP transport settings using the `NettyNioAsyncHttpClient <https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/http/nio/netty/NettyNioAsyncHttpClient.html>`__ for asynchronous clients, or the `ApacheHttpClient <https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/http/apache/ApacheHttpClient.html>`__ for synchronous clients. 

         

      

    
    :type ReceiveRequestAttemptId: string
    :param ReceiveRequestAttemptId: 

      This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

       

      The token used for deduplication of ``ReceiveMessage`` calls. If a networking issue occurs after a ``ReceiveMessage`` action, and instead of a response you receive a generic error, it is possible to retry the same action with an identical ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` to retrieve the same set of messages, even if their visibility timeout has not yet expired.

       

       
      * You can use ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` only for 5 minutes after a ``ReceiveMessage`` action. 
       
      * When you set ``FifoQueue`` , a caller of the ``ReceiveMessage`` action can provide a ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` explicitly. 
       
      * If a caller of the ``ReceiveMessage`` action doesn't provide a ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` , Amazon SQS generates a ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` . 
       
      * It is possible to retry the ``ReceiveMessage`` action with the same ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` if none of the messages have been modified (deleted or had their visibility changes). 
       
      * During a visibility timeout, subsequent calls with the same ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` return the same messages and receipt handles. If a retry occurs within the deduplication interval, it resets the visibility timeout. For more information, see `Visibility Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 

      .. warning::

         If a caller of the ``ReceiveMessage`` action still processes messages when the visibility timeout expires and messages become visible, another worker consuming from the same queue can receive the same messages and therefore process duplicates. Also, if a consumer whose message processing time is longer than the visibility timeout tries to delete the processed messages, the action fails with an error. To mitigate this effect, ensure that your application observes a safe threshold before the visibility timeout expires and extend the visibility timeout as necessary. 

       
       
      * While messages with a particular ``MessageGroupId`` are invisible, no more messages belonging to the same ``MessageGroupId`` are returned until the visibility timeout expires. You can still receive messages with another ``MessageGroupId`` as long as it is also visible. 
       
      * If a caller of ``ReceiveMessage`` can't track the ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` , no retries work until the original visibility timeout expires. As a result, delays might occur but the messages in the queue remain in a strict order. 
       

       

      The maximum length of ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` is 128 characters. ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` can contain alphanumeric characters (``a-z`` , ``A-Z`` , ``0-9`` ) and punctuation (``!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~`` ).

    :type MessageDeduplicationId: string
    :param MessageDeduplicationId: 

      This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

       

      The token used for deduplication of sent messages. If a message with a particular ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is sent successfully, any messages sent with the same ``MessageDeduplicationId`` are accepted successfully but aren't delivered during the 5-minute deduplication interval. For more information, see `Exactly-once processing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

       

       
      * Every message must have a unique ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , 

         
        * You may provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` explicitly. 
         
        * If you aren't able to provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and you enable ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).  
         
        * If you don't provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and the queue doesn't have ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, the action fails with an error.

      * When ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. 
       
      * If you send one message with ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` enabled and then another message with a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` that is the same as the one generated for the first ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.  
       

       

      .. note::

         

        The ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is available to the consumer of the message (this can be useful for troubleshooting delivery issues).

         

        If a message is sent successfully but the acknowledgement is lost and the message is resent with the same ``MessageDeduplicationId`` after the deduplication interval, Amazon SQS can't detect duplicate messages.

         

        Amazon SQS continues to keep track of the message deduplication ID even after the message is received and deleted.

         

       

      The maximum length of ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is 128 characters. ``MessageDeduplicationId`` can contain alphanumeric characters (``a-z`` , ``A-Z`` , ``0-9`` ) and punctuation (``!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~`` ).

    :type MessageGroupId: string
    :param MessageGroupId: 

      This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

       

      The tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different message groups might be processed out of order). To interleave multiple ordered streams within a single queue, use ``MessageGroupId`` values (for example, session data for multiple users). In this scenario, multiple consumers can process the queue, but the session data of each user is processed in a FIFO fashion.

       

       
      * You must associate a non-empty ``MessageGroupId`` with a message. If you don't provide a ``MessageGroupId`` , the action fails. 
       
      * ``ReceiveMessage`` might return messages with multiple ``MessageGroupId`` values. For each ``MessageGroupId`` , the messages are sorted by time sent. The caller can't specify a ``MessageGroupId`` . 
       

       

      The length of ``MessageGroupId`` is 128 characters. Valid values: alphanumeric characters and punctuation ``(!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~)`` .

       

      For best practices of using ``MessageGroupId`` , see `Using the MessageGroupId Property <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagegroupid-property.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

       ``#x9`` | ``#xA`` | ``#xD`` | ``#x20`` to ``#xD7FF`` | ``#xE000`` to ``#xFFFD`` | ``#x10000`` to ``#x10FFFF``  

       

      Any characters not included in this list will be rejected. For more information, see the `W3C specification for characters <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charsets>`__ .

       

     

    If you don't specify the ``DelaySeconds`` parameter for an entry, Amazon SQS uses the default value for the queue.

     

    Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the ``param.n`` notation. Values of ``n`` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

     

     ``&AttributeName.1=first``  

     

     ``&AttributeName.2=second``

                Amazon SQS supports the following logical data types: ``String`` , ``Number`` , and ``Binary`` . For the ``Number`` data type, you must use ``StringValue`` .

For more information, see `Amazon SQS Message Attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-message-metadata.html#sqs-message-attributes>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

                

              
            
      
    
        - **MessageDeduplicationId** *(string) --* 

          This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

           

          The token used for deduplication of messages within a 5-minute minimum deduplication interval. If a message with a particular ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is sent successfully, subsequent messages with the same ``MessageDeduplicationId`` are accepted successfully but aren't delivered. For more information, see `Exactly-once processing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

           

           
          * Every message must have a unique ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , 

             
            * You may provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` explicitly. 
             
            * If you aren't able to provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and you enable ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).  
             
            * If you don't provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and the queue doesn't have ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, the action fails with an error. 
             
            * If the queue has ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, your ``MessageDeduplicationId`` overrides the generated one. 
             

           
           
          * When ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. 
           
          * If you send one message with ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` enabled and then another message with a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` that is the same as the one generated for the first ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.  
           

           

          .. note::

             

            The ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is available to the consumer of the message (this can be useful for troubleshooting delivery issues).

             

            If a message is sent successfully but the acknowledgement is lost and the message is resent with the same ``MessageDeduplicationId`` after the deduplication interval, Amazon SQS can't detect duplicate messages.

             

            Amazon SQS continues to keep track of the message deduplication ID even after the message is received and deleted.

             

           

          The length of ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is 128 characters. ``MessageDeduplicationId`` can contain alphanumeric characters (``a-z`` , ``A-Z`` , ``0-9`` ) and punctuation (``!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~`` ).

           

          For best practices of using ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , see `Using the MessageDeduplicationId Property <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagededuplicationid-property.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

          

        
        - **MessageGroupId** *(string) --* 

          This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

           

          The tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different message groups might be processed out of order). To interleave multiple ordered streams within a single queue, use ``MessageGroupId`` values (for example, session data for multiple users). In this scenario, multiple consumers can process the queue, but the session data of each user is processed in a FIFO fashion.

           

           
          * You must associate a non-empty ``MessageGroupId`` with a message. If you don't provide a ``MessageGroupId`` , the action fails. 
           
          * ``ReceiveMessage`` might return messages with multiple ``MessageGroupId`` values. For each ``MessageGroupId`` , the messages are sorted by time sent. The caller can't specify a ``MessageGroupId`` . 
           

           

          The length of ``MessageGroupId`` is 128 characters. Valid values: alphanumeric characters and punctuation ``(!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~)`` .

           

          For best practices of using ``MessageGroupId`` , see `Using the MessageGroupId Property <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagegroupid-property.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .

           

          .. warning::

             

             ``MessageGroupId`` is required for FIFO queues. You can't use it for Standard queues.

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = queue.set_attributes(
          Attributes={
              'string': 'string'
          }
      )
    :type Attributes: dict
    :param Attributes: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A map of attributes to set.

       

      The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the ``SetQueueAttributes`` action uses:

       

       
      * ``DelaySeconds`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 (15 minutes). Default: 0.  
       
      * ``MaximumMessageSize`` – The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) up to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default: 262,144 (256 KiB).  
       
      * ``MessageRetentionPeriod`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer representing seconds, from 60 (1 minute) to 1,209,600 (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days).  
       
      * ``Policy`` – The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy. For more information about policy structure, see `Overview of Amazon Web Services IAM Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html>`__ in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide* .  
       
      * ``ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which a ``  ReceiveMessage `` action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.  
       
      * ``RedrivePolicy`` – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. For more information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see `Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 

         
        * ``deadLetterTargetArn`` – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of ``maxReceiveCount`` is exceeded. 
         
        * ``maxReceiveCount`` – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. When the ``ReceiveCount`` for a message exceeds the ``maxReceiveCount`` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue. 
         

       

      .. note::

         

        The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.

         

       
       
      * ``VisibilityTimeout`` – The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see `Visibility Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . 
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `server-side-encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``KmsMasterKeyId`` – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see `Key Terms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-sse-key-terms>`__ . While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always ``alias/aws/sqs`` , the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be ``alias/*MyAlias* `` . For more examples, see `KeyId <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters>`__ in the *Key Management Service API Reference* .  
       
      * ``KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds`` – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a `data key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys>`__ to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see `How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-how-does-the-data-key-reuse-period-work>`__ .  
       

       

      The following attribute applies only to `FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` – Enables content-based deduplication. For more information, see `Exactly-once processing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* . Note the following:  

         
        * Every message must have a unique ``MessageDeduplicationId`` . 

           
          * You may provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` explicitly. 
           
          * If you aren't able to provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and you enable ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).  
           
          * If you don't provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and the queue doesn't have ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, the action fails with an error. 
           
          * If the queue has ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, your ``MessageDeduplicationId`` overrides the generated one. 
           

         
         
        * When ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. 
         
        * If you send one message with ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` enabled and then another message with a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` that is the same as the one generated for the first ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.  
         

       
       

       

      The following attributes apply only to `high throughput for FIFO queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/high-throughput-fifo.html>`__ :

       

       
      * ``DeduplicationScope`` – Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are ``messageGroup`` and ``queue`` . 
       
      * ``FifoThroughputLimit`` – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are ``perQueue`` and ``perMessageGroupId`` . The ``perMessageGroupId`` value is allowed only when the value for ``DeduplicationScope`` is ``messageGroup`` . 
       

       

      To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:

       

       
      * Set ``DeduplicationScope`` to ``messageGroup`` . 
       
      * Set ``FifoThroughputLimit`` to ``perMessageGroupId`` . 
       

       

      If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified.

       

      For information on throughput quotas, see `Quotas related to messages <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide* .
