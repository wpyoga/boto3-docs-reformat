.. py:class:: CodeBuild.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS CodeBuild
   

  AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming languages and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in AWS CodeBuild to use your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay only for the build time you consume. For more information about AWS CodeBuild, see the * `AWS CodeBuild User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html>`__ .*

                * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                 
                * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` .

                If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ . 

                
              

              - **auth** *(dict) --*

              - **reportBuildStatus** *(boolean) --* 

                Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

                 

                To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated.

                  * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                   
                  * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project.

                  If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory.

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                - **sha256sum** *(string) --* 

                  The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact.

                   

                  You can use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm file integrity and authenticity.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    This value is available only if the build project's ``packaging`` value is set to ``ZIP`` .

                     

                  
                

                - **md5sum** *(string) --* 

                  The MD5 hash of the build artifact.

                   

                  You can use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm file integrity and authenticity.

                  If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

                  
                

                - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --*

                  Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

                   

                  By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                    NONE  

                  The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                    READ_ONLY  

                  The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                    FULL  

                  The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                   

                   
                  * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy.

            - **cache** *(dict) --* 

              Information about the cache for the build project.

              
              

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:

                * ``S3`` : The build project reads and writes from and to S3. 
                 
                * ``LOCAL`` : The build project stores a cache locally on a build host that is only available to that build host. 
                 

                
              

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                Information about the cache location: 

                 

                 
                * ``NO_CACHE`` or ``LOCAL`` : This value is ignored. 
                 
                * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
                 

                
              

              - **modes** *(list) --* 

                An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for ``LOCAL`` cache types.

                 

                Possible values are:

                  LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

                Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

                  LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

                Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

                 

                .. note::

                   

                   
                  * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
                   
                  * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
                   
                  * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
                   

                   

                  LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

                Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

                 

                 
                * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
                 
                * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
                 
                * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.

                * For an image tag: ``<registry>/<repository>:<tag>`` . For example, in the Docker repository that CodeBuild uses to manage its Docker images, this would be ``aws/codebuild/standard:4.0`` .  
                 
                * For an image digest: ``<registry>/<repository>@<digest>`` . For example, to specify an image with the digest "sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf," use ``<registry>/<repository>@sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf`` .

                    .. warning::

                       

                      We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

                       

                    
                  

                  - **type** *(string) --* 

                    The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                     

                     
                    * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store.

                    * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
                     
                    * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                     

                    
              
            
              

              - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

                Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

                 

                You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

                 

                If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

                 

                 ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

                 

                 ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

                 

                If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

                 

                 ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

                 

                 ``- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

                
              

              - **certificate** *(string) --* 

                The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object key that contains the PEM-encoded certificate for the build project. For more information, see `certificate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project-cli.html#cli.environment.certificate>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

                
              

              - **registryCredential** *(dict) --* 

                The credentials for access to a private registry.

                
                

                - **credential** *(string) --* 

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of credentials created using AWS Secrets Manager. 

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

                     

                  
                

                - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* 

                  The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

                  
            
              

              - **imagePullCredentialsType** *(string) --* 

                The type of credentials AWS CodeBuild uses to pull images in your build. There are two valid values: 

                 

                 
                * ``CODEBUILD`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.  
                 
                * ``SERVICE_ROLE`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.

You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

                   

                  The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system.

                - **identifier** *(string) --* 

                  The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

                   

                  The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

                  
                

                - **mountOptions** *(string) --*

The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ .

                  * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                   
                  * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` .

                  If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ .

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  FULL  

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                    This value is available only if the build project's ``packaging`` value is set to ``ZIP`` .

                     

                  
                

                - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

                  If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

                  
                

                - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

                  Information that tells you if encryption for build artifacts is disabled. 

                  
                

                - **artifactIdentifier** *(string) --* 

                  An identifier for this artifact definition. 

                  
                

                - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

                   

                  By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                    NONE  

                  The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                    READ_ONLY  

                  The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                    FULL  

                  The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                   

                   
                  * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                   
                  * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                   

                   

                  For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

                    
            
          
            

            - **cache** *(dict) --* 

              Information about the cache for the build.

              
              

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:

                 

                 
                * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project does not use any cache. 
                 
                * ``S3`` : The build project reads and writes from and to S3. 
                 
                * ``LOCAL`` : The build project stores a cache locally on a build host that is only available to that build host. 
                 

                
              

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                Information about the cache location: 

                 

                 
                * ``NO_CACHE`` or ``LOCAL`` : This value is ignored. 
                 
                * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
                 

                
              

              - **modes** *(list) --* 

                An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for ``LOCAL`` cache types.

                 

                Possible values are:

                  LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

                Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

                  LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

                Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

                 

                .. note::

                   

                   
                  * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
                   
                  * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
                   
                  * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
                   

                   

                  LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

                Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

                 

                 
                * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
                 
                * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
                 
                * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.  
                 

                  
                

                - *(string) --*

              Information about the build environment for this build.

              
              

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                The type of build environment to use for related builds.

                 

                 
                * The environment type ``ARM_CONTAINER`` is available only in regions US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and EU (Frankfurt).

              - **image** *(string) --* 

                The image tag or image digest that identifies the Docker image to use for this build project. Use the following formats:

                 

                 
                * For an image tag: ``<registry>/<repository>:<tag>`` . For example, in the Docker repository that CodeBuild uses to manage its Docker images, this would be ``aws/codebuild/standard:4.0`` .  
                 
                * For an image digest: ``<registry>/<repository>@<digest>`` . For example, to specify an image with the digest "sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf," use ``<registry>/<repository>@sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf`` . 
                 

                
              

              - **computeType** *(string) --* 

                Information about the compute resources the build project uses. Available values include:

                    .. warning::

                       

                      We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

                       

                    
                  

                  - **type** *(string) --* 

                    The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                     

                     
                    * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a parameter store environment variable, see `env/parameter-store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                     
                    * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
                     
                    * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                     

                    
              
            
              

              - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

                Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

                 

                You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

                 

                If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

                 

                 ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

                 

                 ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

                 

                If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

                 

                 ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

                 

                 ``- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

                
              

              - **certificate** *(string) --* 

                The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object key that contains the PEM-encoded certificate for the build project.

                The credentials for access to a private registry.

                
                

                - **credential** *(string) --* 

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of credentials created using AWS Secrets Manager. 

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

                     

                  
                

                - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* 

                  The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

                  
            
              

              - **imagePullCredentialsType** *(string) --* 

                The type of credentials AWS CodeBuild uses to pull images in your build. There are two valid values: 

                 

                 
                * ``CODEBUILD`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.  
                 
                * ``SERVICE_ROLE`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.  
                 

                 

                When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials. 

                
          
            

            - **serviceRole** *(string) --*

                    FULL  

                  The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                   

                   
                  * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                   
                  * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                   

                   

                  For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

                  During a build, the value of a variable is available starting with the ``install`` phase. It can be updated between the start of the ``install`` phase and the end of the ``post_build`` phase. After the ``post_build`` phase ends, the value of exported variables cannot change.

                   

                
                

                - **name** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the exported environment variable.

A ``ProjectFileSystemLocation`` object specifies the ``identifier`` , ``location`` , ``mountOptions`` , ``mountPoint`` , and ``type`` of a file system created using Amazon Elastic File System. 

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Information about a file system created by Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). For more information, see `What Is Amazon Elastic File System? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html>`__  

                
                

                - **type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of the file system. The one supported type is ``EFS`` . 

                  
                

                - **location** *(string) --* 

                  A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

                   

                  The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system. 

                  
                

                - **mountPoint** *(string) --*

                - **identifier** *(string) --* 

                  The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

                   

                  The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

                  
                

                - **mountOptions** *(string) --* 

                  The mount options for a file system created by AWS EFS. The default mount options used by CodeBuild are ``nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2`` . For more information, see `Recommended NFS Mount Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-nfs-mount-settings.html>`__ . 

                  
            
          
            

            - **debugSession** *(dict) --*

                Specifies if session debugging is enabled for this build.

                
              

              - **sessionTarget** *(string) --* 

                Contains the identifier of the Session Manager session used for the build. To work with the paused build, you open this session to examine, control, and resume the build.

                
          
            

            - **buildBatchArn** *(string) --* 

              The ARN of the batch build that this build is a member of, if applicable.

              
        
      
        

        - **buildsNotFound** *(list) --* 

          The IDs of builds for which information could not be found.

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                The type of repository that contains the source code to be built. Valid values include:

                 

                 
                * ``BITBUCKET`` : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository. 
                 
                * ``CODECOMMIT`` : The source code is in an AWS CodeCommit repository. 
                 
                * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The source code settings are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline. 
                 
                * ``GITHUB`` : The source code is in a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise Cloud repository. 
                 
                * ``GITHUB_ENTERPRISE`` : The source code is in a GitHub Enterprise Server repository.

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                Information about the location of the source code to be built. Valid values include:

                 

                 
                * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline ignores it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
                 
                * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the buildspec file (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name>`` ). 
                 
                * For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the following.  

                   
                  * The path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, ``<bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip`` ).  
                   
                  * The path to the folder that contains the source code (for example, ``<bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/`` ).  
                   

                 
                 
                * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                 
                * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                 

                
              

              - **gitCloneDepth** *(integer) --* 

                Information about the Git clone depth for the build project.

                
              

              - **gitSubmodulesConfig** *(dict) --* 

                Information about the Git submodules configuration for the build project. 

                
                

                - **fetchSubmodules** *(boolean) --* 

                  Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your AWS CodeBuild build project. 

                  
            
              

              - **buildspec** *(string) --* 

                The buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

                 

                If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ . 

                
              

              - **auth** *(dict) --* 

                Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

                 

                This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly.

                
                

                - **type** *(string) --* 

                  .. note::

                     

                    This data type is deprecated and is no longer accurate or used. 

                     

                   

                  The authorization type to use. The only valid value is ``OAUTH`` , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

                  
                

                - **resource** *(string) --* 

                  The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type.

                  
            
              

              - **reportBuildStatus** *(boolean) --* 

                Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

                 

                To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see `Source provider access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider. 

                   

                
              

              - **buildStatusConfig** *(dict) --* 

                Contains information that defines how the build project reports the build status to the source provider. This option is only used when the source provider is ``GITHUB`` , ``GITHUB_ENTERPRISE`` , or ``BITBUCKET`` .

                
                

                - **context** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter depends on the source provider.

                  * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                   
                  * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                   

                  
                

                - **gitCloneDepth** *(integer) --*

                  If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ .

                - **reportBuildStatus** *(boolean) --* 

                  Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

                   

                  To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see `Source provider access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

                    The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider. 

                     

                  
                

                - **buildStatusConfig** *(dict) --* 

                  Contains information that defines how the build project reports the build status to the source provider. This option is only used when the source provider is ``GITHUB`` , ``GITHUB_ENTERPRISE`` , or ``BITBUCKET`` .

                  
                  

                  - **context** *(string) --* 

                    Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter depends on the source provider.

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                Information about the build output artifact location:

                 

                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
                 

                
              

              - **path** *(string) --* 

                Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

                 

                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, ``path`` is not used. 
                 

                 

                For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

                
              

              - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

                Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

                 

                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

                   
                  * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
                   
                  * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
                   

                 
                 

                 

                For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .

                
              

              - **name** *(string) --* 

                Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

                * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket. 
                 

                 

                For example:

                 

                 
                * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .  
                 
                * If ``path`` is empty, ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.  
                 
                * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>`` .  
                 

                
              

              - **packaging** *(string) --* 

                The type of build output artifact to create:

                 

                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

                   
                  * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that contains the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
                   
                  * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that contains the build output. 
                   

                 
                 

                
              

              - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

                If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

                
              

              - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException is thrown. 

                
              

              - **artifactIdentifier** *(string) --* 

                An identifier for this artifact definition. 

                
              

              - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

                Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

                 

                By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  FULL  

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                Information about the build output artifacts for the build project.

                
                

                - **type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

                   

                   
                  * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project has build output generated through AWS CodePipeline.  

                  .. note::

                     The ``CODEPIPELINE`` type is not supported for ``secondaryArtifacts`` . 

                   
                   
                  * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project does not produce any build output. 
                   
                  * ``S3`` : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3. 
                   

                  
                

                - **location** *(string) --* 

                  Information about the build output artifact location:

                   

                   
                  * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
                   
                  * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
                   
                  * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket.

                  Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

                   

                   
                  * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
                   
                  * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
                   
                  * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, ``path`` is not used. 
                   

                   

                  For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

                Possible values are:

                  LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

                Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

                  LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

                Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

                 

                .. note::

                  * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
                   

                   

                  LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

                Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

                 

                 
                * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
                 
                * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
                 
                * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.

                      We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

                       

                    
                  

                  - **type** *(string) --* 

                    The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                     

                     
                    * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a parameter store environment variable, see `env/parameter-store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                     
                    * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
                     
                    * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                     

                    
              
            
              

              - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

                Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

                 

                You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

                 

                If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

                 

                 ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

                 

                 ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

                 

                If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

                 

                 ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

                 

                 ``- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

                
              

              - **certificate** *(string) --* 

                The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object key that contains the PEM-encoded certificate for the build project.

                  .. note::

                     

                    The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

                     

                  
                

                - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* 

                  The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

                  
            
              

              - **imagePullCredentialsType** *(string) --* 

                The type of credentials AWS CodeBuild uses to pull images in your build. There are two valid values: 

                 

                 
                * ``CODEBUILD`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.  
                 
                * ``SERVICE_ROLE`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.  
                 

                 

                When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials. 

                
          
            

            - **serviceRole** *(string) --*

            - **encryptionKey** *(string) --* 

              The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to be used for encrypting the build output artifacts.

               

              .. note::

                 

                You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build output artifacts if your service role has permission to that key. 

                 

               

              You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format ``alias/<alias-name>`` ). 

              
            

            - **tags** *(list) --* 

              A list of tag key and value pairs associated with this build project.

                  A Bitbucket webhook does not support ``secret`` . 

                   

                
              

              - **branchFilter** *(string) --* 

                A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the regular expression, then it is built. If ``branchFilter`` is empty, then all branches are built.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  It is recommended that you use ``filterGroups`` instead of ``branchFilter`` . 

                   

                
              

              - **filterGroups** *(list) --* 

                An array of arrays of ``WebhookFilter`` objects used to determine which webhooks are triggered. At least one ``WebhookFilter`` in the array must specify ``EVENT`` as its ``type`` . 

                 

                For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the ``filterGroups`` array must pass. For a filter group to pass, each of its filters must pass. 

                
                

                - *(list) --*

                        EVENT   

                      A webhook event triggers a build when the provided ``pattern`` matches one of five event types: ``PUSH`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_CREATED`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`` , and ``PULL_REQUEST_MERGED`` . The ``EVENT`` patterns are specified as a comma-separated string. For example, ``PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` filters all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events. 

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        The ``PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`` works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise only. 

                         

                        ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID   

                      A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . 

                        HEAD_REF   

                      A webhook event triggers a build when the head reference matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . For example, ``refs/heads/branch-name`` and ``refs/tags/tag-name`` . 

                       

                      Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub and GitHub Enterprise pull request, Bitbucket push, and Bitbucket pull request events. 

                        BASE_REF   

                      A webhook event triggers a build when the base reference matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . For example, ``refs/heads/branch-name`` . 

                       

                      .. note::

                      .. note::

                         

                        Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events. 

                         

                        COMMIT_MESSAGE  

                      A webhook triggers a build when the head commit message matches the regular expression ``pattern`` .

                       

                      .. note::

                    - **pattern** *(string) --* 

                      For a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses ``EVENT`` type, a comma-separated string that specifies one or more events. For example, the webhook filter ``PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` allows all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events to trigger a build. 

                       

                      For a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses any of the other filter types, a regular expression pattern. For example, a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses ``HEAD_REF`` for its ``type`` and the pattern ``^refs/heads/`` triggers a build when the head reference is a branch with a reference name ``refs/heads/branch-name`` .

                  By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                    NONE  

                  The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                    READ_ONLY  

                  The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                    FULL  

                  The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                   

                   
                  * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy.

                - **location** *(string) --* 

                  A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

                   

                  The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system. 

                  
                

                - **mountPoint** *(string) --*

                - **identifier** *(string) --* 

                  The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

                   

                  The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

                  
                

                - **mountOptions** *(string) --* 

                  The mount options for a file system created by AWS EFS. The default mount options used by CodeBuild are ``nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2`` . For more information, see `Recommended NFS Mount Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-nfs-mount-settings.html>`__ .

              - **combineArtifacts** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies if the build artifacts for the batch build should be combined into a single artifact location.

                
              

              - **restrictions** *(dict) --* 

                A ``BatchRestrictions`` object that specifies the restrictions for the batch build.

                
                

                - **maximumBuildsAllowed** *(integer) --* 

                  Specifies the maximum number of builds allowed.

                Specifies the maximum amount of time, in minutes, that the batch build must be completed in.

                
          
            

            - **concurrentBuildLimit** *(integer) --* 

              The maximum number of concurrent builds that are allowed for this project.

               

              New builds are only started if the current number of builds is less than or equal to this limit. If the current build count meets this limit, new builds are throttled and are not run.

              
        
      
        

        - **projectsNotFound** *(list) --*

    :type source: dict
    :param source: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Information about the build input source code for the build project.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of repository that contains the source code to be built. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``BITBUCKET`` : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository. 
         
        * ``CODECOMMIT`` : The source code is in an AWS CodeCommit repository.

        * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline ignores it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
         
        * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the buildspec file (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name>`` ). 
         
        * For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the following.

        * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
         
        * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` .

      - **buildspec** *(string) --* 

        The buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

         

        If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ .

        - **resource** *(string) --* 

          The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type.

          

        
      
      - **reportBuildStatus** *(boolean) --* 

        Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

         

        To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see `Source provider access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

        - **reportBuildStatus** *(boolean) --* 

          Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

           

          To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see `Source provider access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

           

          .. note::

             

            The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider. 

             

          

        
        - **buildStatusConfig** *(dict) --*

    :type artifacts: dict
    :param artifacts: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Information about the build output artifacts for the build project.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project has build output generated through AWS CodePipeline.  

        .. note::

           The ``CODEPIPELINE`` type is not supported for ``secondaryArtifacts`` . 

         
         
        * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project does not produce any build output. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3. 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the build output artifact location:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
         

        

      
      - **path** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, ``path`` is not used. 
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

           
          * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
           
          * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
           

         
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **name** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket. 
         

         

        For example:

         

         
        * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .  
         
        * If ``path`` is empty, ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.  
         
        * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>`` .  
         

        

      
      - **packaging** *(string) --* 

        The type of build output artifact to create:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

           
          * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that contains the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
           
          * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that contains the build output. 
           

         
         

        

      
      - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

        If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

        

      
      - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

        Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException is thrown. 

        

      
      - **artifactIdentifier** *(string) --* 

        An identifier for this artifact definition. 

        

      
      - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

         

        By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

          NONE  

        The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

          READ_ONLY  

        The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

          FULL  

        The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

         

         
        * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
         
        * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
         

         

        For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

          Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

           

          By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

            NONE  

          The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

            READ_ONLY  

          The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

            FULL  

          The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

           

           
          * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
           
          * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
           

           

          For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

            

        
      
  
    :type cache: dict
    :param cache: 

      Stores recently used information so that it can be quickly accessed at a later time.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project does not use any cache. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project reads and writes from and to S3. 
         
        * ``LOCAL`` : The build project stores a cache locally on a build host that is only available to that build host. 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the cache location: 

         

         
        * ``NO_CACHE`` or ``LOCAL`` : This value is ignored. 
         
        * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
         

        

      
      - **modes** *(list) --* 

        An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for ``LOCAL`` cache types.

         

        Possible values are:

          LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

        Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

          LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

        Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

         

        .. note::

           

           
          * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
           
          * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
           
          * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
           

           

          LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

        Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

         

         
        * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
         
        * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
         
        * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.  
         

          

      
        - *(string) --*

            The value of the environment variable.

             

            .. warning::

               

              We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

               

            

          
          - **type** *(string) --* 

            The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

             

             
            * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a parameter store environment variable, see `env/parameter-store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
             
            * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
             
            * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
             

            

          
        
    
      - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

        Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

         

        You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

         

        If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

         

         ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

         

         ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

         

        If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

         

         ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

         

         ``- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

        

      
      - **certificate** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object key that contains the PEM-encoded certificate for the build project. For more information, see `certificate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project-cli.html#cli.environment.certificate>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

        

      
      - **registryCredential** *(dict) --* 

        The credentials for access to a private registry.

        

      
        - **credential** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of credentials created using AWS Secrets Manager. 

           

          .. note::

             

            The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

             

          

        
        - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

          

        
      
      - **imagePullCredentialsType** *(string) --* 

        The type of credentials AWS CodeBuild uses to pull images in your build. There are two valid values: 

         

         
        * ``CODEBUILD`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.  
         
        * ``SERVICE_ROLE`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.  
         

         

        When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials. 

        

      
    
    :type serviceRole: string
    :param serviceRole: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that enables AWS CodeBuild to interact with dependent AWS services on behalf of the AWS account.

      .. note::

         

        You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build output artifacts if your service role has permission to that key. 

         

       

      You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format ``alias/<alias-name>`` ). 

      

    
    :type tags: list
    :param tags: 

      A list of tag key and value pairs associated with this build project.

        - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

           

          By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

            NONE  

          The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

            READ_ONLY  

          The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

            FULL  

          The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

           

           
          * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
           
          * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
           

           

          For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

      - *(dict) --* 

        Information about a file system created by Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). For more information, see `What Is Amazon Elastic File System? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html>`__  

        

      
        - **type** *(string) --* 

          The type of the file system. The one supported type is ``EFS`` . 

          

        
        - **location** *(string) --* 

          A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

           

          The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system. 

          

        
        - **mountPoint** *(string) --* 

          The location in the container where you mount the file system. 

          

        
        - **identifier** *(string) --* 

          The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

           

          The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

          

        
        - **mountOptions** *(string) --* 

          The mount options for a file system created by AWS EFS. The default mount options used by CodeBuild are ``nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2`` . For more information, see `Recommended NFS Mount Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-nfs-mount-settings.html>`__ . 

          

        
      
  
    :type buildBatchConfig: dict
    :param buildBatchConfig: 

      A  ProjectBuildBatchConfig object that defines the batch build options for the project.

      

    
      - **serviceRole** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the service role ARN for the batch build project.

        

      
      - **combineArtifacts** *(boolean) --* 

        Specifies if the build artifacts for the batch build should be combined into a single artifact location.

        

      
      - **restrictions** *(dict) --* 

        A ``BatchRestrictions`` object that specifies the restrictions for the batch build.

        

      
        - **maximumBuildsAllowed** *(integer) --* 

          Specifies the maximum number of builds allowed.

          

        
        - **computeTypesAllowed** *(list) --* 

          An array of strings that specify the compute types that are allowed for the batch build. See `Build environment compute types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-compute-types.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* for these values. 

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
      - **timeoutInMins** *(integer) --* 

        Specifies the maximum amount of time, in minutes, that the batch build must be completed in.

        

      
    
    :type concurrentBuildLimit: integer
    :param concurrentBuildLimit: 

      The maximum number of concurrent builds that are allowed for this project.

       

      New builds are only started if the current number of builds is less than or equal to this limit. If the current build count meets this limit, new builds are throttled and are not run.

            Information about the build input source code for this build project.

            
            

            - **type** *(string) --* 

              The type of repository that contains the source code to be built. Valid values include:

               

               
              * ``BITBUCKET`` : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository. 
               
              * ``CODECOMMIT`` : The source code is in an AWS CodeCommit repository. 
               
              * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The source code settings are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline. 
               
              * ``GITHUB`` : The source code is in a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise Cloud repository.

              Information about the location of the source code to be built. Valid values include:

               

               
              * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline ignores it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
               
              * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the buildspec file (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name>`` ). 
               
              * For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the following.  

                 
                * The path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, ``<bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip`` ).  
                 
                * The path to the folder that contains the source code (for example, ``<bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/`` ).  
                 

               
               
              * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
               
              * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` .

              * ``S3`` : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3. 
               

              
            

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the build output artifact location:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
               

              
            

            - **path** *(string) --* 

              Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, ``path`` is not used. 
               

               

              For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

              
            

            - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

              Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

                 
                * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
                 
                * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
                 

               
               

               

              For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .

              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket. 
               

               

              For example:

               

               
              * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .  
               
              * If ``path`` is empty, ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.

            - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

              If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

              
            

            - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

              Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException is thrown. 

              
            

            - **artifactIdentifier** *(string) --* 

              An identifier for this artifact definition.

                NONE  

              The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                READ_ONLY  

              The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                FULL  

              The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

               

               
              * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
               
              * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

                LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

              Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

               

              .. note::

                 

                 
                * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
                 
                * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
                 
                * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
                 

                 

                LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

              Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

               

               
              * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
               
              * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
               
              * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.

                  .. warning::

                     

                    We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

                     

                  
                

                - **type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                   

                   
                  * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a parameter store environment variable, see `env/parameter-store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   
                  * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
                   
                  * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   

                  
            
          
            

            - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

              Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

               

              You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

               

              If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

               

              If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

              
            

            - **certificate** *(string) --* 

              The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object key that contains the PEM-encoded certificate for the build project. For more information, see `certificate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project-cli.html#cli.environment.certificate>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

              
            

            - **registryCredential** *(dict) --* 

              The credentials for access to a private registry.

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of credentials created using AWS Secrets Manager. 

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

                   

                
              

              - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* 

                The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

                
          
            

            - **imagePullCredentialsType** *(string) --* 

              The type of credentials AWS CodeBuild uses to pull images in your build. There are two valid values: 

               

               
              * ``CODEBUILD`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.  
               
              * ``SERVICE_ROLE`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.  
               

               

              When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials. 

              
        
          

          - **serviceRole** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that enables AWS CodeBuild to interact with dependent AWS services on behalf of the AWS account.

            
          

          - **timeoutInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

            How long, in minutes, from 5 to 480 (8 hours), for AWS CodeBuild to wait before timing out any related build that did not get marked as completed. The default is 60 minutes.

            
          

          - **queuedTimeoutInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

            The number of minutes a build is allowed to be queued before it times out.

            .. note::

               

              You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build output artifacts if your service role has permission to that key. 

               

             

            You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format ``alias/<alias-name>`` ). 

            
          

          - **tags** *(list) --* 

            A list of tag key and value pairs associated with this build project.

             

            These tags are available for use by AWS services that support AWS CodeBuild build project tags.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A tag, consisting of a key and a value.

               

              This tag is available for use by AWS services that support tags in AWS CodeBuild.

              
              

              - **key** *(string) --* 

                The tag's key.

            - **branchFilter** *(string) --* 

              A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the regular expression, then it is built. If ``branchFilter`` is empty, then all branches are built.

               

              .. note::

                 

                It is recommended that you use ``filterGroups`` instead of ``branchFilter`` . 

                 

              
            

            - **filterGroups** *(list) --* 

              An array of arrays of ``WebhookFilter`` objects used to determine which webhooks are triggered. At least one ``WebhookFilter`` in the array must specify ``EVENT`` as its ``type`` . 

               

              For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the ``filterGroups`` array must pass. For a filter group to pass, each of its filters must pass. 

              
              

              - *(list) --* 
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A filter used to determine which webhooks trigger a build.

                      EVENT   

                    A webhook event triggers a build when the provided ``pattern`` matches one of five event types: ``PUSH`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_CREATED`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`` , and ``PULL_REQUEST_MERGED`` . The ``EVENT`` patterns are specified as a comma-separated string. For example, ``PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` filters all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events. 

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      The ``PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`` works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise only. 

                       

                      ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID   

                    A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . 

                      HEAD_REF   

                    A webhook event triggers a build when the head reference matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . For example, ``refs/heads/branch-name`` and ``refs/tags/tag-name`` . 

                     

                    Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub and GitHub Enterprise pull request, Bitbucket push, and Bitbucket pull request events. 

                      BASE_REF   

                    A webhook event triggers a build when the base reference matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . For example, ``refs/heads/branch-name`` . 

                     

                    .. note::

                      FILE_PATH   

                    A webhook triggers a build when the path of a changed file matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . 

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events. 

                       

                      COMMIT_MESSAGE  

                    A webhook triggers a build when the head commit message matches the regular expression ``pattern`` .

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events. 

                       

                      
                  

                  - **pattern** *(string) --* 

                    For a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses ``EVENT`` type, a comma-separated string that specifies one or more events. For example, the webhook filter ``PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` allows all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events to trigger a build. 

                     

                    For a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses any of the other filter types, a regular expression pattern. For example, a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses ``HEAD_REF`` for its ``type`` and the pattern ``^refs/heads/`` triggers a build when the head reference is a branch with a reference name ``refs/heads/branch-name`` . 

                    
                  

                  - **excludeMatchedPattern** *(boolean) --* 

                    Used to indicate that the ``pattern`` determines which webhook events do not trigger a build. If true, then a webhook event that does not match the ``pattern`` triggers a build. If false, then a webhook event that matches the ``pattern`` triggers a build.

                By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  FULL  

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                 

                 

                For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

                A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

                 

                The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system. 

                
              

              - **mountPoint** *(string) --*

              - **identifier** *(string) --* 

                The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

                 

                The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

                
              

              - **mountOptions** *(string) --* 

                The mount options for a file system created by AWS EFS. The default mount options used by CodeBuild are ``nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2`` . For more information, see `Recommended NFS Mount Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-nfs-mount-settings.html>`__ .

            - **restrictions** *(dict) --* 

              A ``BatchRestrictions`` object that specifies the restrictions for the batch build.

              
              

              - **maximumBuildsAllowed** *(integer) --* 

                Specifies the maximum number of builds allowed.

                
              

              - **computeTypesAllowed** *(list) --* 

                An array of strings that specify the compute types that are allowed for the batch build. See `Build environment compute types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-compute-types.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* for these values. 

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
          
            

            - **timeoutInMins** *(integer) --*

  .. py:method:: create_webhook(**kwargs)

    

    For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub or Bitbucket repository, enables AWS CodeBuild to start rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If you enable webhooks for an AWS CodeBuild project, and the project is used as a build step in AWS CodePipeline, then two identical builds are created for each commit. One build is triggered through webhooks, and one through AWS CodePipeline. Because billing is on a per-build basis, you are billed for both builds. Therefore, if you are using AWS CodePipeline, we recommend that you disable webhooks in AWS CodeBuild. In the AWS CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box. For more information, see step 5 in `Change a Build Project's Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/change-project.html#change-project-console>`__ .

    :type branchFilter: string
    :param branchFilter: 

      A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the regular expression, then it is built. If ``branchFilter`` is empty, then all branches are built.

       

      .. note::

         

        It is recommended that you use ``filterGroups`` instead of ``branchFilter`` . 

         

      

    
    :type filterGroups: list
    :param filterGroups: 

      An array of arrays of ``WebhookFilter`` objects used to determine which webhooks are triggered. At least one ``WebhookFilter`` in the array must specify ``EVENT`` as its ``type`` . 

       

      For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the ``filterGroups`` array must pass. For a filter group to pass, each of its filters must pass. 

      

    
      - *(list) --* 

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A filter used to determine which webhooks trigger a build. 

          

        
          - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The type of webhook filter. There are six webhook filter types: ``EVENT`` , ``ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID`` , ``HEAD_REF`` , ``BASE_REF`` , ``FILE_PATH`` , and ``COMMIT_MESSAGE`` . 

              EVENT   

            A webhook event triggers a build when the provided ``pattern`` matches one of five event types: ``PUSH`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_CREATED`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`` , and ``PULL_REQUEST_MERGED`` . The ``EVENT`` patterns are specified as a comma-separated string. For example, ``PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` filters all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events. 

             

            .. note::

               

              The ``PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`` works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise only. 

               

              ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID   

            A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . 

              HEAD_REF   

            A webhook event triggers a build when the head reference matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . For example, ``refs/heads/branch-name`` and ``refs/tags/tag-name`` . 

             

            Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub and GitHub Enterprise pull request, Bitbucket push, and Bitbucket pull request events. 

              BASE_REF   

            A webhook event triggers a build when the base reference matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . For example, ``refs/heads/branch-name`` . 

             

            .. note::

               

              Works with pull request events only. 

               

              FILE_PATH   

            A webhook triggers a build when the path of a changed file matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . 

             

            .. note::

               

              Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events. 

               

              COMMIT_MESSAGE  

            A webhook triggers a build when the head commit message matches the regular expression ``pattern`` .

             

            .. note::

               

              Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events. 

               

              

          
          - **pattern** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            For a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses ``EVENT`` type, a comma-separated string that specifies one or more events. For example, the webhook filter ``PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` allows all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events to trigger a build. 

             

            For a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses any of the other filter types, a regular expression pattern. For example, a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses ``HEAD_REF`` for its ``type`` and the pattern ``^refs/heads/`` triggers a build when the head reference is a branch with a reference name ``refs/heads/branch-name`` . 

            

          
          - **excludeMatchedPattern** *(boolean) --* 

            Used to indicate that the ``pattern`` determines which webhook events do not trigger a build. If true, then a webhook event that does not match the ``pattern`` triggers a build. If false, then a webhook event that matches the ``pattern`` triggers a build. 

            

          
        
    
  
    :type buildType: string
    :param buildType:

(After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
               
              * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project.

              If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ .

If this is set and you use a different source provider, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

               

              To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see `Source provider access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

                * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline ignores it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
                 
                * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the buildspec file (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name>`` ). 
                 
                * For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the following.

                * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                 
                * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project.

The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ .

                For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

                  
          
        
          

          - **cache** *(dict) --* 

            Information about the cache for the build.

            
            

            - **type** *(string) --* 

              The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:

               

               
              * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project does not use any cache. 
               
              * ``S3`` : The build project reads and writes from and to S3. 
               
              * ``LOCAL`` : The build project stores a cache locally on a build host that is only available to that build host. 
               

              
            

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the cache location: 

               

               
              * ``NO_CACHE`` or ``LOCAL`` : This value is ignored. 
               
              * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
               

              
            

            - **modes** *(list) --* 

              An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for ``LOCAL`` cache types.

               

              Possible values are:

                LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

              Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

                LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

              Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

               

              .. note::

                 

                 
                * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
                 
                * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
                 
                * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
                 

                 

                LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

              Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

               

               
              * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
               
              * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
               
              * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.  
               

                
              

              - *(string) --*

              * For an image tag: ``<registry>/<repository>:<tag>`` . For example, in the Docker repository that CodeBuild uses to manage its Docker images, this would be ``aws/codebuild/standard:4.0`` .  
               
              * For an image digest: ``<registry>/<repository>@<digest>`` . For example, to specify an image with the digest "sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf," use ``<registry>/<repository>@sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf`` . 
               

              
            

            - **computeType** *(string) --*

                    We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

                     

                  
                

                - **type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                   

                   
                  * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a parameter store environment variable, see `env/parameter-store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   
                  * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
                   
                  * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   

                  
            
          
            

            - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

              Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

               

              You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

               

              If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

               

              If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

              
            

            - **certificate** *(string) --*

                .. note::

                   

                  The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

                   

                
              

              - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* 

                The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

                
          
            

            - **imagePullCredentialsType** *(string) --*

              * ``CODEBUILD`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.  
               
              * ``SERVICE_ROLE`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.  
               

               

              When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials. 

              
        
          

          - **serviceRole** *(string) --* 

            The name of a service role used for this build.

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                 

                 

                For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

              Exported environment variables are used in conjunction with AWS CodePipeline to export environment variables from the current build stage to subsequent stages in the pipeline. For more information, see `Working with variables <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/actions-variables.html>`__ in the *AWS CodePipeline User Guide* .

               

              .. note::

                 

                During a build, the value of a variable is available starting with the ``install`` phase. It can be updated between the start of the ``install`` phase and the end of the ``post_build`` phase. After the ``post_build`` phase ends, the value of exported variables cannot change.

                 

              
              

              - **name** *(string) --* 

                The name of the exported environment variable.

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **fileSystemLocations** *(list) --* 

            An array of ``ProjectFileSystemLocation`` objects for a CodeBuild build project. A ``ProjectFileSystemLocation`` object specifies the ``identifier`` , ``location`` , ``mountOptions`` , ``mountPoint`` , and ``type`` of a file system created using Amazon Elastic File System. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Information about a file system created by Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). For more information, see `What Is Amazon Elastic File System? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html>`__  

              
              

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                The type of the file system. The one supported type is ``EFS`` . 

                
              

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

                 

                The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system. 

                
              

              - **mountPoint** *(string) --* 

                The location in the container where you mount the file system. 

                
              

              - **identifier** *(string) --* 

                The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

                 

                The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

                
              

              - **mountOptions** *(string) --* 

                The mount options for a file system created by AWS EFS. The default mount options used by CodeBuild are ``nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2`` . For more information, see `Recommended NFS Mount Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-nfs-mount-settings.html>`__ . 

                
          
        
          

          - **debugSession** *(dict) --* 

            Contains information about the debug session for this build.

            - **sessionTarget** *(string) --* 

              Contains the identifier of the Session Manager session used for the build. To work with the paused build, you open this session to examine, control, and resume the build.

              
        
          

          - **buildBatchArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the batch build that this build is a member of, if applicable.

            
      
    
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`CodeBuild.Client.exceptions.InvalidInputException`

          idempotencyToken='string',
          retryType='RETRY_ALL_BUILDS'|'RETRY_FAILED_BUILDS'
      )
    :type id: string
    :param id: 

      Specifies the identifier of the batch build to restart.

      

    
    :type idempotencyToken: string
    :param idempotencyToken: 

      A unique, case sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idempotency of the ``RetryBuildBatch`` request. The token is included in the ``RetryBuildBatch`` request and is valid for five minutes. If you repeat the ``RetryBuildBatch`` request with the same token, but change a parameter, AWS CodeBuild returns a parameter mismatch error.

              * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
               
              * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` .

              If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ . 

              
            

            - **auth** *(dict) --* 

              Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

               

              This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly.

              
              

              - **type** *(string) --*

                * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                 
                * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file.

              * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
               
              * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact.

                 

                You can use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm file integrity and authenticity.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This value is available only if the build project's ``packaging`` value is set to ``ZIP`` .

                   

                
              

              - **md5sum** *(string) --* 

                The MD5 hash of the build artifact.

                .. note::

                   

                  This value is available only if the build project's ``packaging`` value is set to ``ZIP`` .

                   

                
              

              - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

                If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

                
              

              - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --*

                Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

                 

                By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  FULL  

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

            - **type** *(string) --* 

              The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:

               

               
              * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project does not use any cache. 
               
              * ``S3`` : The build project reads and writes from and to S3. 
               
              * ``LOCAL`` : The build project stores a cache locally on a build host that is only available to that build host. 
               

              
            

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the cache location: 

               

               
              * ``NO_CACHE`` or ``LOCAL`` : This value is ignored. 
               
              * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
               

              
            

            - **modes** *(list) --* 

              An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for ``LOCAL`` cache types.

               

              Possible values are:

                LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

              Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

                LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

              Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

               

              .. note::

                 

                 
                * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
                 
                * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
                 
                * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
                 

                 

                LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

              Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

               

               
              * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
               
              * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
               
              * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.  
               

                
              

              - *(string) --*

            - **image** *(string) --* 

              The image tag or image digest that identifies the Docker image to use for this build project. Use the following formats:

               

               
              * For an image tag: ``<registry>/<repository>:<tag>`` . For example, in the Docker repository that CodeBuild uses to manage its Docker images, this would be ``aws/codebuild/standard:4.0`` .  
               
              * For an image digest: ``<registry>/<repository>@<digest>`` . For example, to specify an image with the digest "sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf," use ``<registry>/<repository>@sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf`` . 
               

              
            

            - **computeType** *(string) --*

                    We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

                     

                  
                

                - **type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                   

                   
                  * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a parameter store environment variable, see `env/parameter-store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   
                  * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
                   
                  * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   

                  
            
          
            

            - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

              Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

               

              You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

               

              If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

               

              If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of credentials created using AWS Secrets Manager. 

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

                   

                
              

              - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* 

                The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

                
          
            

            - **imagePullCredentialsType** *(string) --*

              * ``CODEBUILD`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.  
               
              * ``SERVICE_ROLE`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.  
               

               

              When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials. 

              
        
          

          - **serviceRole** *(string) --* 

            The name of a service role used for builds in the batch.

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  FULL  

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                 

                 

                For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

                 

                The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system.

              - **identifier** *(string) --* 

                The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

                 

                The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

                
              

              - **mountOptions** *(string) --*

          The type of repository that contains the source code to be built. Valid values include:

           

           
          * ``BITBUCKET`` : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository. 
           
          * ``CODECOMMIT`` : The source code is in an AWS CodeCommit repository. 
           
          * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The source code settings are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline. 
           
          * ``GITHUB`` : The source code is in a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise Cloud repository. 
           
          * ``GITHUB_ENTERPRISE`` : The source code is in a GitHub Enterprise Server repository. 
           
          * ``NO_SOURCE`` : The project does not have input source code. 
           
          * ``S3`` : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline ignores it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
           
          * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the buildspec file (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name>`` ).

          * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
           
          * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
           

          

        
        - **gitCloneDepth** *(integer) --*

        - **gitSubmodulesConfig** *(dict) --* 

          Information about the Git submodules configuration for the build project. 

          

        
          - **fetchSubmodules** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your AWS CodeBuild build project. 

            

          
        
        - **buildspec** *(string) --* 

          The buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

           

          If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ . 

          

        
        - **auth** *(dict) --* 

          Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

           

          This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly.

          

        
          - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            .. note::

            The authorization type to use. The only valid value is ``OAUTH`` , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

            

          
          - **resource** *(string) --* 

            The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type.

            

          
        
        - **reportBuildStatus** *(boolean) --* 

          Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

           

          To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see `Source provider access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

           

          .. note::

             

            The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider. 

             

          

        
        - **buildStatusConfig** *(dict) --* 

          Contains information that defines how the build project reports the build status to the source provider. This option is only used when the source provider is ``GITHUB`` , ``GITHUB_ENTERPRISE`` , or ``BITBUCKET`` .

          

        
          - **context** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter depends on the source provider.

              Bitbucket  

            This parameter is used for the ``name`` parameter in the Bitbucket commit status. For more information, see `build <https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Bworkspace%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/commit/%7Bnode%7D/statuses/build>`__ in the Bitbucket API documentation.

        * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project has build output generated through AWS CodePipeline.  

        .. note::

           The ``CODEPIPELINE`` type is not supported for ``secondaryArtifacts`` . 

         
         
        * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project does not produce any build output. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3. 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the build output artifact location:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
         

        

      
      - **path** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, ``path`` is not used. 
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

           
          * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
           
          * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
           

         
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **name** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket. 
         

         

        For example:

         

         
        * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .  
         
        * If ``path`` is empty, ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.  
         
        * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>`` .  
         

        

      
      - **packaging** *(string) --* 

        The type of build output artifact to create:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

           
          * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that contains the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
           
          * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that contains the build output. 
           

         
         

        

      
      - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

        If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

        

      
      - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

        Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException is thrown. 

        

      
      - **artifactIdentifier** *(string) --* 

        An identifier for this artifact definition. 

        

      
      - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

         

        By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

          NONE  

        The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

          READ_ONLY  

        The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

          FULL  

        The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

         

         
        * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
         
        * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
         

         

        For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

        - **location** *(string) --* 

          Information about the build output artifact location:

           

           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild.

        - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

          Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

          .. warning::

             

            We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

             

          

        
        - **type** *(string) --* 

          The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

      - **resource** *(string) --* 

        The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type.

        

      
    
    :type gitCloneDepthOverride: integer
    :param gitCloneDepthOverride: 

      The user-defined depth of history, with a minimum value of 0, that overrides, for this build only, any previous depth of history defined in the build project.

      

    
    :type gitSubmodulesConfigOverride: dict
    :param gitSubmodulesConfigOverride: 

      Information about the Git submodules configuration for this build of an AWS CodeBuild build project. 

      

    
      - **fetchSubmodules** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your AWS CodeBuild build project. 

        

      
    
    :type buildspecOverride: string
    :param buildspecOverride: 

      A buildspec file declaration that overrides, for this build only, the latest one already defined in the build project.

       

      If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ . 

      

    
    :type insecureSslOverride: boolean
    :param insecureSslOverride: 

      Enable this flag to override the insecure SSL setting that is specified in the build project. The insecure SSL setting determines whether to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to the project source code. This override applies only if the build's source is GitHub Enterprise.

      

    
    :type reportBuildStatusOverride: boolean
    :param reportBuildStatusOverride: 

      Set to true to report to your source provider the status of a build's start and completion. If you use this option with a source provider other than GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

       

      To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see `Source provider access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

       

      .. note::

         

        The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider. 

         

      

    
    :type buildStatusConfigOverride: dict
    :param buildStatusConfigOverride: 

      Contains information that defines how the build project reports the build status to the source provider. This option is only used when the source provider is ``GITHUB`` , ``GITHUB_ENTERPRISE`` , or ``BITBUCKET`` .

      

    
      - **context** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter depends on the source provider.

    :param cacheOverride: 

      A ProjectCache object specified for this build that overrides the one defined in the build project.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project does not use any cache. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project reads and writes from and to S3. 
         
        * ``LOCAL`` : The build project stores a cache locally on a build host that is only available to that build host. 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the cache location: 

         

         
        * ``NO_CACHE`` or ``LOCAL`` : This value is ignored. 
         
        * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
         

        

      
      - **modes** *(list) --* 

        An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for ``LOCAL`` cache types.

         

        Possible values are:

          LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

        Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

          LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

        Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

         

        .. note::

           

           
          * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
           
          * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
           
          * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
           

           

          LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

        Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

         

         
        * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
         
        * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
         
        * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.  
         

          

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    
    :type serviceRoleOverride: string
    :param serviceRoleOverride:

    :type privilegedModeOverride: boolean
    :param privilegedModeOverride: 

      Enable this flag to override privileged mode in the build project.

      

    
    :type timeoutInMinutesOverride: integer
    :param timeoutInMinutesOverride: 

      The number of build timeout minutes, from 5 to 480 (8 hours), that overrides, for this build only, the latest setting already defined in the build project.

      

    
    :type queuedTimeoutInMinutesOverride: integer
    :param queuedTimeoutInMinutesOverride: 

      The number of minutes a build is allowed to be queued before it times out. 

      

    
    :type encryptionKeyOverride: string
    :param encryptionKeyOverride: 

      The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) that overrides the one specified in the build project. The CMK key encrypts the build output artifacts.

       

      .. note::

         

        You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build output artifacts if your service role has permission to that key. 

         

       

      You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format ``alias/<alias-name>`` ).

      

    
    :type idempotencyToken: string
    :param idempotencyToken: 

      A unique, case sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idempotency of the StartBuild request. The token is included in the StartBuild request and is valid for 5 minutes. If you repeat the StartBuild request with the same token, but change a parameter, AWS CodeBuild returns a parameter mismatch error. 

      

    
    :type logsConfigOverride: dict
    :param logsConfigOverride:

          * ``ENABLED`` : Amazon CloudWatch Logs are enabled for this build project. 
           
          * ``DISABLED`` : Amazon CloudWatch Logs are not enabled for this build project. 
           

          

        
        - **groupName** *(string) --* 

          The group name of the logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see `Working with Log Groups and Log Streams <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Working-with-log-groups-and-streams.html>`__ . 

          

        
        - **streamName** *(string) --* 

          The prefix of the stream name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see `Working with Log Groups and Log Streams <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Working-with-log-groups-and-streams.html>`__ . 

          

        
      
      - **s3Logs** *(dict) --*

        - **status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The current status of the S3 build logs. Valid values are:

           

           
          * ``ENABLED`` : S3 build logs are enabled for this build project. 
           
          * ``DISABLED`` : S3 build logs are not enabled for this build project. 
           

          

        
        - **location** *(string) --* 

          The ARN of an S3 bucket and the path prefix for S3 logs. If your Amazon S3 bucket name is ``my-bucket`` , and your path prefix is ``build-log`` , then acceptable formats are ``my-bucket/build-log`` or ``arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/build-log`` . 

          

        
        - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

          Set to true if you do not want your S3 build log output encrypted. By default S3 build logs are encrypted. 

          

        
        - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

           

          By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

            NONE  

          The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

            READ_ONLY  

          The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

            FULL  

          The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

           

           
          * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
           
          * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
           

           

          For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

        .. note::

           

          The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

           

        

      
      - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

        

      
    
    :type imagePullCredentialsTypeOverride: string
    :param imagePullCredentialsTypeOverride: 

      The type of credentials AWS CodeBuild uses to pull images in your build. There are two valid values: 

        CODEBUILD  

      Specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.

        SERVICE_ROLE  

      Specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role. 

         

      When using a cross-account or private registry image, you must use ``SERVICE_ROLE`` credentials. When using an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use ``CODEBUILD`` credentials.

              * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
               
              * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` .

              The buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

               

              If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ . 

              
            

            - **auth** *(dict) --* 

              Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

               

              This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly.

              
              

              - **type** *(string) --*

            - **reportBuildStatus** *(boolean) --* 

              Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

               

              To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see `Source provider access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

               

              .. note::

                 

                The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider. 

                 

              
            

            - **buildStatusConfig** *(dict) --* 

              Contains information that defines how the build project reports the build status to the source provider. This option is only used when the source provider is ``GITHUB`` , ``GITHUB_ENTERPRISE`` , or ``BITBUCKET`` .

              
              

              - **context** *(string) --* 

                Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter depends on the source provider.

                  Bitbucket  

                This parameter is used for the ``name`` parameter in the Bitbucket commit status.

                * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                 
                * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project.

The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ .

                FULL  

              The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

               

               
              * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
               
              * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  This value is available only if the build project's ``packaging`` value is set to ``ZIP`` .

                   

                
              

              - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

                If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

                
              

              - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Information that tells you if encryption for build artifacts is disabled. 

                
              

              - **artifactIdentifier** *(string) --* 

                An identifier for this artifact definition. 

                
              

              - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

                Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

                 

                By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  FULL  

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                 

                 

                For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

                  
          
        
          

          - **cache** *(dict) --* 

            Information about the cache for the build.

            
            

            - **type** *(string) --* 

              The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:

               

               
              * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project does not use any cache. 
               
              * ``S3`` : The build project reads and writes from and to S3. 
               
              * ``LOCAL`` : The build project stores a cache locally on a build host that is only available to that build host. 
               

              
            

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the cache location: 

               

               
              * ``NO_CACHE`` or ``LOCAL`` : This value is ignored. 
               
              * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
               

              
            

            - **modes** *(list) --* 

              An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for ``LOCAL`` cache types.

               

              Possible values are:

                LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

              Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

                LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

              Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

               

              .. note::

                 

                 
                * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
                 
                * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
                 
                * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
                 

                 

                LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

              Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

               

               
              * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
               
              * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
               
              * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.  
               

                
              

              - *(string) --*

            - **image** *(string) --* 

              The image tag or image digest that identifies the Docker image to use for this build project. Use the following formats:

               

               
              * For an image tag: ``<registry>/<repository>:<tag>`` . For example, in the Docker repository that CodeBuild uses to manage its Docker images, this would be ``aws/codebuild/standard:4.0`` .  
               
              * For an image digest: ``<registry>/<repository>@<digest>`` . For example, to specify an image with the digest "sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf," use ``<registry>/<repository>@sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf`` . 
               

              
            

            - **computeType** *(string) --* 

              Information about the compute resources the build project uses. Available values include:

                    We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

                     

                  
                

                - **type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                   

                   
                  * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a parameter store environment variable, see `env/parameter-store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   
                  * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
                   
                  * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   

                  
            
          
            

            - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

              Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

               

              You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

               

              If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

               

              If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of credentials created using AWS Secrets Manager. 

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

                   

                
              

              - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* 

                The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

                
          
            

            - **imagePullCredentialsType** *(string) --*

              * ``CODEBUILD`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.  
               
              * ``SERVICE_ROLE`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.  
               

               

              When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials. 

              
        
          

          - **serviceRole** *(string) --* 

            The name of a service role used for this build.

                The current status of the S3 build logs. Valid values are:

                 

                 
                * ``ENABLED`` : S3 build logs are enabled for this build project. 
                 
                * ``DISABLED`` : S3 build logs are not enabled for this build project. 
                 

                
              

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                The ARN of an S3 bucket and the path prefix for S3 logs. If your Amazon S3 bucket name is ``my-bucket`` , and your path prefix is ``build-log`` , then acceptable formats are ``my-bucket/build-log`` or ``arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/build-log`` . 

                
              

              - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Set to true if you do not want your S3 build log output encrypted. By default S3 build logs are encrypted. 

                
              

              - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

                Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

                 

                By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  FULL  

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                 

                 

                For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

                  
          
        
          

          - **timeoutInMinutes** *(integer) --*

              Exported environment variables are used in conjunction with AWS CodePipeline to export environment variables from the current build stage to subsequent stages in the pipeline. For more information, see `Working with variables <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/actions-variables.html>`__ in the *AWS CodePipeline User Guide* .

               

              .. note::

                 

                During a build, the value of a variable is available starting with the ``install`` phase. It can be updated between the start of the ``install`` phase and the end of the ``post_build`` phase. After the ``post_build`` phase ends, the value of exported variables cannot change.

                 

              
              

              - **name** *(string) --* 

                The name of the exported environment variable.

A ``ProjectFileSystemLocation`` object specifies the ``identifier`` , ``location`` , ``mountOptions`` , ``mountPoint`` , and ``type`` of a file system created using Amazon Elastic File System. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Information about a file system created by Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). For more information, see `What Is Amazon Elastic File System? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html>`__  

              
              

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                The type of the file system. The one supported type is ``EFS`` . 

                
              

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

                 

                The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system. 

                
              

              - **mountPoint** *(string) --* 

                The location in the container where you mount the file system. 

                
              

              - **identifier** *(string) --* 

                The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

                 

                The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

                
              

              - **mountOptions** *(string) --* 

                The mount options for a file system created by AWS EFS. The default mount options used by CodeBuild are ``nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2`` . For more information, see `Recommended NFS Mount Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-nfs-mount-settings.html>`__ . 

                
          
        
          

          - **debugSession** *(dict) --* 

            Contains information about the debug session for this build.

            - **sessionTarget** *(string) --* 

              Contains the identifier of the Session Manager session used for the build. To work with the paused build, you open this session to examine, control, and resume the build.

              
        
          

          - **buildBatchArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the batch build that this build is a member of, if applicable.

          * ``CODECOMMIT`` : The source code is in an AWS CodeCommit repository. 
           
          * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The source code settings are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline. 
           
          * ``GITHUB`` : The source code is in a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise Cloud repository. 
           
          * ``GITHUB_ENTERPRISE`` : The source code is in a GitHub Enterprise Server repository. 
           
          * ``NO_SOURCE`` : The project does not have input source code. 
           
          * ``S3`` : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket. 
           

          

        
        - **location** *(string) --* 

          Information about the location of the source code to be built. Valid values include:

           

           
          * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline ignores it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
           
          * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the buildspec file (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name>`` ). 
           
          * For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the following.  

             
            * The path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, ``<bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip`` ).  
             
            * The path to the folder that contains the source code (for example, ``<bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/`` ).  
             

           
           
          * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
           
          * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
           

          

        
        - **gitCloneDepth** *(integer) --*

          Information about the Git submodules configuration for the build project. 

          

        
          - **fetchSubmodules** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your AWS CodeBuild build project. 

            

          
        
        - **buildspec** *(string) --* 

          The buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

           

          If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ . 

          

        
        - **auth** *(dict) --* 

          Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

           

          This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly.

          

        
          - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            .. note::

            The authorization type to use. The only valid value is ``OAUTH`` , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

            

          
          - **resource** *(string) --* 

            The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type.

            

          
        
        - **reportBuildStatus** *(boolean) --* 

          Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

           

          To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see `Source provider access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

           

          .. note::

             

            The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider. 

             

          

        
        - **buildStatusConfig** *(dict) --* 

          Contains information that defines how the build project reports the build status to the source provider. This option is only used when the source provider is ``GITHUB`` , ``GITHUB_ENTERPRISE`` , or ``BITBUCKET`` .

          

        
          - **context** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter depends on the source provider.

              Bitbucket  

            This parameter is used for the ``name`` parameter in the Bitbucket commit status. For more information, see `build <https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Bworkspace%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/commit/%7Bnode%7D/statuses/build>`__ in the Bitbucket API documentation.

              GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server  

            This parameter is used for the ``context`` parameter in the GitHub commit status. For more information, see `Create a commit status <https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/#create-a-commit-status>`__ in the GitHub developer guide.

              

          
          - **targetUrl** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the target url of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter depends on the source provider.

              Bitbucket  

            This parameter is used for the ``url`` parameter in the Bitbucket commit status. For more information, see `build <https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Bworkspace%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/commit/%7Bnode%7D/statuses/build>`__ in the Bitbucket API documentation.

    :type sourceVersion: string
    :param sourceVersion: 

      The version of the batch build input to be built, for this build only. If not specified, the latest version is used. If specified, the contents depends on the source provider:

        AWS CodeCommit  

      The commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

        GitHub  

      The commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format ``pr/pull-request-ID`` (for example ``pr/25`` ). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

        Bitbucket  

      The commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

        Amazon S3  

      The version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use.

         

      If ``sourceVersion`` is specified at the project level, then this ``sourceVersion`` (at the build level) takes precedence. 

       

      For more information, see `Source Version Sample with CodeBuild <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-source-version.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 

      

    
    :type artifactsOverride: dict
    :param artifactsOverride: 

      An array of ``ProjectArtifacts`` objects that contains information about the build output artifact overrides for the build project.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project has build output generated through AWS CodePipeline.  

        .. note::

           The ``CODEPIPELINE`` type is not supported for ``secondaryArtifacts`` . 

         
         
        * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project does not produce any build output. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3. 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the build output artifact location:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
         

        

      
      - **path** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, ``path`` is not used. 
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

           
          * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
           
          * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
           

         
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **name** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket. 
         

         

        For example:

         

         
        * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .  
         
        * If ``path`` is empty, ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.  
         
        * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>`` .  
         

        

      
      - **packaging** *(string) --* 

        The type of build output artifact to create:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

           
          * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that contains the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
           
          * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that contains the build output. 
           

         
         

        

      
      - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

        If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

        

      
      - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

        Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException is thrown. 

        

      
      - **artifactIdentifier** *(string) --* 

        An identifier for this artifact definition. 

        

      
      - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

         

        By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

          NONE  

        The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

          READ_ONLY  

        The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

          FULL  

        The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

         

         
        * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
         
        * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
         

         

        For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

          .. note::

             The ``CODEPIPELINE`` type is not supported for ``secondaryArtifacts`` . 

           
           
          * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project does not produce any build output. 
           
          * ``S3`` : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3. 
           

          

        
        - **location** *(string) --* 

          Information about the build output artifact location:

           

           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
           

          

        
        - **path** *(string) --* 

          Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

           

           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, ``path`` is not used. 
           

           

          For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

          

        
        - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

          Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

           

           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

             
            * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
             
            * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
             

           
           

           

          For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .

          

        
        - **name** *(string) --* 

          Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

           

           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket. 
           

           

          For example:

           

           
          * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .  
           
          * If ``path`` is empty, ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.  
           
          * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>`` .  
           

          

        
        - **packaging** *(string) --* 

          The type of build output artifact to create:

           

           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

             
            * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that contains the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
             
            * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that contains the build output. 
             

           
           

          

        
        - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

          If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

          

        
        - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

          Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException is thrown. 

          

        
        - **artifactIdentifier** *(string) --* 

          An identifier for this artifact definition. 

          

        
        - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

           

          By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

            NONE  

          The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

            READ_ONLY  

          The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

            FULL  

          The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

           

           
          * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
           
          * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
           

           

          For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

          .. warning::

             

            We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

             

          

        
        - **type** *(string) --*

          * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a parameter store environment variable, see `env/parameter-store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
           
          * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
           
          * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

    :param buildspecOverride: 

      A buildspec file declaration that overrides, for this build only, the latest one already defined in the build project.

       

      If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ . 

      

    
    :type insecureSslOverride: boolean
    :param insecureSslOverride: 

      Enable this flag to override the insecure SSL setting that is specified in the batch build project. The insecure SSL setting determines whether to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to the project source code. This override applies only if the build's source is GitHub Enterprise.

      

    
    :type reportBuildBatchStatusOverride: boolean
    :param reportBuildBatchStatusOverride: 

      Set to ``true`` to report to your source provider the status of a batch build's start and completion. If you use this option with a source provider other than GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

       

      .. note::

         

        The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider.

    :param cacheOverride: 

      A ``ProjectCache`` object that specifies cache overrides.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project does not use any cache. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project reads and writes from and to S3. 
         
        * ``LOCAL`` : The build project stores a cache locally on a build host that is only available to that build host. 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the cache location: 

         

         
        * ``NO_CACHE`` or ``LOCAL`` : This value is ignored. 
         
        * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
         

        

      
      - **modes** *(list) --* 

        An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for ``LOCAL`` cache types.

         

        Possible values are:

          LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

        Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

          LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

        Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

         

        .. note::

           

           
          * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
           
          * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
           
          * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
           

           

          LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

        Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

         

         
        * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
         
        * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
         
        * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.  
         

          

      
        - *(string) --*

    :type encryptionKeyOverride: string
    :param encryptionKeyOverride: 

      The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) that overrides the one specified in the batch build project. The CMK key encrypts the build output artifacts.

       

      .. note::

         

        You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build output artifacts if your service role has permission to that key. 

         

       

      You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format ``alias/<alias-name>`` ).

      

    
    :type idempotencyToken: string
    :param idempotencyToken: 

      A unique, case sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idempotency of the ``StartBuildBatch`` request. The token is included in the ``StartBuildBatch`` request and is valid for five minutes. If you repeat the ``StartBuildBatch`` request with the same token, but change a parameter, AWS CodeBuild returns a parameter mismatch error.

      

    
    :type logsConfigOverride: dict
    :param logsConfigOverride: 

      A ``LogsConfig`` object that override the log settings defined in the batch build project.

          * ``DISABLED`` : S3 build logs are not enabled for this build project. 
           

          

        
        - **location** *(string) --* 

          The ARN of an S3 bucket and the path prefix for S3 logs. If your Amazon S3 bucket name is ``my-bucket`` , and your path prefix is ``build-log`` , then acceptable formats are ``my-bucket/build-log`` or ``arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/build-log`` . 

          

        
        - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

          Set to true if you do not want your S3 build log output encrypted. By default S3 build logs are encrypted. 

          

        
        - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

        The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

        

      
    
    :type imagePullCredentialsTypeOverride: string
    :param imagePullCredentialsTypeOverride: 

      The type of credentials AWS CodeBuild uses to pull images in your batch build. There are two valid values: 

        CODEBUILD

                LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

              Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

                LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

              Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

               

              .. note::

                 

                 
                * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
                 
                * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
                 
                * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
                 

                 

                LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

              Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

               

               
              * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
               
              * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
               
              * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.

              * The environment type ``ARM_CONTAINER`` is available only in regions US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and EU (Frankfurt). 
               
              * The environment type ``LINUX_CONTAINER`` with compute type ``build.general1.2xlarge`` is available only in regions US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), China (Beijing), and China (Ningxia).

                    We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

                     

                  
                

                - **type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                   

                   
                  * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a parameter store environment variable, see `env/parameter-store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   
                  * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
                   
                  * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   

                  
            
          
            

            - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

              Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

               

              You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

               

              If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

               

              If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of credentials created using AWS Secrets Manager. 

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

                   

                
              

              - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* 

                The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager.

              The type of credentials AWS CodeBuild uses to pull images in your build. There are two valid values: 

               

               
              * ``CODEBUILD`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.  
               
              * ``SERVICE_ROLE`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.  
               

               

              When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials. 

              
        
          

          - **serviceRole** *(string) --* 

            The name of a service role used for builds in the batch.

            
          

          - **logConfig** *(dict) --*

            - **s3Logs** *(dict) --* 

              Information about logs built to an S3 bucket for a build project. S3 logs are not enabled by default. 

              
              

              - **status** *(string) --* 

                The current status of the S3 build logs. Valid values are:

                 

                 
                * ``ENABLED`` : S3 build logs are enabled for this build project.

                By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                 

                 

                For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

            .. note::

               

              You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build output artifacts if your service role has permission to that key. 

               

             

            You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format ``alias/<alias-name>`` ).

            
          

          - **buildBatchNumber** *(integer) --* 

            The number of the batch build. For each project, the ``buildBatchNumber`` of its first batch build is ``1`` .

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

                 

                The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system. 

                
              

              - **mountPoint** *(string) --* 

                The location in the container where you mount the file system. 

                
              

              - **identifier** *(string) --* 

                The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

                 

                The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

                
              

              - **mountOptions** *(string) --* 

                The mount options for a file system created by AWS EFS. The default mount options used by CodeBuild are ``nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2`` . For more information, see `Recommended NFS Mount Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-nfs-mount-settings.html>`__ .

              * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
               
              * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` .

              The buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

               

              If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ . 

              
            

            - **auth** *(dict) --* 

              Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

               

              This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly.

                * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                 
                * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file.

The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ .

                FULL  

              The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

               

               
              * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
               
              * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

              - **sha256sum** *(string) --* 

                The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact.

                 

                You can use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm file integrity and authenticity.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This value is available only if the build project's ``packaging`` value is set to ``ZIP`` .

                   

                
              

              - **md5sum** *(string) --* 

                The MD5 hash of the build artifact.

                 

                You can use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm file integrity and authenticity.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This value is available only if the build project's ``packaging`` value is set to ``ZIP`` .

                   

                
              

              - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

                If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

                
              

              - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --*

              - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

                Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

                 

                By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  FULL  

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                 

                 

                For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

                  
          
        
          

          - **cache** *(dict) --* 

            Information about the cache for the build.

            
            

            - **type** *(string) --* 

              The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:

               

               
              * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project does not use any cache. 
               
              * ``S3`` : The build project reads and writes from and to S3. 
               
              * ``LOCAL`` : The build project stores a cache locally on a build host that is only available to that build host. 
               

              
            

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the cache location: 

               

               
              * ``NO_CACHE`` or ``LOCAL`` : This value is ignored. 
               
              * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
               

              
            

            - **modes** *(list) --* 

              An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for ``LOCAL`` cache types.

               

              Possible values are:

                LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

              Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

                LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

              Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

               

              .. note::

                 

                 
                * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
                 
                * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
                 
                * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
                 

                 

                LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

              Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

               

               
              * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
               
              * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
               
              * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.  
               

                
              

              - *(string) --*

            - **image** *(string) --* 

              The image tag or image digest that identifies the Docker image to use for this build project. Use the following formats:

               

               
              * For an image tag: ``<registry>/<repository>:<tag>`` . For example, in the Docker repository that CodeBuild uses to manage its Docker images, this would be ``aws/codebuild/standard:4.0`` .  
               
              * For an image digest: ``<registry>/<repository>@<digest>`` . For example, to specify an image with the digest "sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf," use ``<registry>/<repository>@sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf`` . 
               

              
            

            - **computeType** *(string) --* 

              Information about the compute resources the build project uses. Available values include:

                    We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

                     

                  
                

                - **type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                   

                   
                  * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a parameter store environment variable, see `env/parameter-store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   
                  * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
                   
                  * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   

                  
            
          
            

            - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

              Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

               

              You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

               

              If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

               

              If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of credentials created using AWS Secrets Manager. 

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

                   

                
              

              - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* 

                The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

                
          
            

            - **imagePullCredentialsType** *(string) --*

              * ``CODEBUILD`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.  
               
              * ``SERVICE_ROLE`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.  
               

               

              When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials. 

              
        
          

          - **serviceRole** *(string) --* 

            The name of a service role used for this build.

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  FULL  

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                 

                 

                For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

              .. note::

                 

                During a build, the value of a variable is available starting with the ``install`` phase. It can be updated between the start of the ``install`` phase and the end of the ``post_build`` phase. After the ``post_build`` phase ends, the value of exported variables cannot change.

                 

              
              

              - **name** *(string) --* 

                The name of the exported environment variable.

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                The type of the file system. The one supported type is ``EFS`` . 

                
              

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

                 

                The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system. 

                
              

              - **mountPoint** *(string) --*

              - **identifier** *(string) --* 

                The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

                 

                The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

                
              

              - **mountOptions** *(string) --* 

                The mount options for a file system created by AWS EFS. The default mount options used by CodeBuild are ``nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2`` . For more information, see `Recommended NFS Mount Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-nfs-mount-settings.html>`__ .

            - **sessionTarget** *(string) --* 

              Contains the identifier of the Session Manager session used for the build. To work with the paused build, you open this session to examine, control, and resume the build.

              
        
          

          - **buildBatchArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the batch build that this build is a member of, if applicable.

                FULL  

              The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

               

               
              * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
               
              * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the cache location: 

               

               
              * ``NO_CACHE`` or ``LOCAL`` : This value is ignored. 
               
              * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
               

              
            

            - **modes** *(list) --* 

              An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for ``LOCAL`` cache types.

               

              Possible values are:

                LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

              Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

                LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

              Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

               

              .. note::

                 

                 
                * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
                 
                * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
                 
                * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
                 

                 

                LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

              Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

               

               
              * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
               
              * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
               
              * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.

              * For an image tag: ``<registry>/<repository>:<tag>`` . For example, in the Docker repository that CodeBuild uses to manage its Docker images, this would be ``aws/codebuild/standard:4.0`` .  
               
              * For an image digest: ``<registry>/<repository>@<digest>`` . For example, to specify an image with the digest "sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf," use ``<registry>/<repository>@sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf`` .

            - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

              Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

               

              You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

               

              If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

               

              If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  FULL  

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                 

                 

                For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

                 

                The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system.

              - **identifier** *(string) --* 

                The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

                 

                The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

                
              

              - **mountOptions** *(string) --*

    :type description: string
    :param description: 

      A new or replacement description of the build project.

      

    
    :type source: dict
    :param source: 

      Information to be changed about the build input source code for the build project.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of repository that contains the source code to be built. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``BITBUCKET`` : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository. 
         
        * ``CODECOMMIT`` : The source code is in an AWS CodeCommit repository. 
         
        * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The source code settings are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline. 
         
        * ``GITHUB`` : The source code is in a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise Cloud repository. 
         
        * ``GITHUB_ENTERPRISE`` : The source code is in a GitHub Enterprise Server repository. 
         
        * ``NO_SOURCE`` : The project does not have input source code. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket. 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --*

        * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline ignores it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
         
        * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the buildspec file (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name>`` ). 
         
        * For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the following.  

           
          * The path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, ``<bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip`` ).  
           
          * The path to the folder that contains the source code (for example, ``<bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/`` ).  
           

         
         
        * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
         
        * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
         

        

      
      - **gitCloneDepth** *(integer) --* 

        Information about the Git clone depth for the build project.

        

      
      - **gitSubmodulesConfig** *(dict) --* 

        Information about the Git submodules configuration for the build project. 

        

      
        - **fetchSubmodules** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your AWS CodeBuild build project. 

          

        
      
      - **buildspec** *(string) --* 

        The buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

         

        If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ . 

        

      
      - **auth** *(dict) --* 

        Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

         

        This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly.

        

      
        - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          .. note::

             

            This data type is deprecated and is no longer accurate or used. 

             

           

          The authorization type to use. The only valid value is ``OAUTH`` , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

          

        
        - **resource** *(string) --* 

          The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type.

          

        
      
      - **reportBuildStatus** *(boolean) --* 

        Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

         

        To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see `Source provider access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

         

        .. note::

           

          The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider. 

           

        

      
      - **buildStatusConfig** *(dict) --* 

        Contains information that defines how the build project reports the build status to the source provider. This option is only used when the source provider is ``GITHUB`` , ``GITHUB_ENTERPRISE`` , or ``BITBUCKET`` .

        

      
        - **context** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter depends on the source provider.

            * The path to the folder that contains the source code (for example, ``<bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/`` ).  
             

           
           
          * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
           
          * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
           

          

        
        - **gitCloneDepth** *(integer) --*

          Information about the Git submodules configuration for the build project. 

          

        
          - **fetchSubmodules** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your AWS CodeBuild build project. 

            

          
        
        - **buildspec** *(string) --* 

          The buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

           

          If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in ``CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR`` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, ``arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`` ). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see `Buildspec File Name and Storage Location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage>`__ . 

          

        
        - **auth** *(dict) --* 

          Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

           

          This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly.

          

        
          - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            .. note::

            The authorization type to use. The only valid value is ``OAUTH`` , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

            

          
          - **resource** *(string) --* 

            The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type.

            

          
        
        - **reportBuildStatus** *(boolean) --* 

          Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an ``invalidInputException`` is thrown. 

           

          To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see `Source provider access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

           

          .. note::

             

            The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider. 

             

          

        
        - **buildStatusConfig** *(dict) --* 

          Contains information that defines how the build project reports the build status to the source provider. This option is only used when the source provider is ``GITHUB`` , ``GITHUB_ENTERPRISE`` , or ``BITBUCKET`` .

          

        
          - **context** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter depends on the source provider.

              Bitbucket  

            This parameter is used for the ``name`` parameter in the Bitbucket commit status. For more information, see `build <https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Bworkspace%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/commit/%7Bnode%7D/statuses/build>`__ in the Bitbucket API documentation.

              GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server  

            This parameter is used for the ``context`` parameter in the GitHub commit status. For more information, see `Create a commit status <https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/#create-a-commit-status>`__ in the GitHub developer guide.

              

          
          - **targetUrl** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the target url of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter depends on the source provider.

          An identifier for this project source. The identifier can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores, and must be less than 128 characters in length. 

          

        
      
  
    :type sourceVersion: string
    :param sourceVersion: 

      A version of the build input to be built for this project. If not specified, the latest version is used. If specified, it must be one of: 

       

       
      * For AWS CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use. 
       
      * For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format ``pr/pull-request-ID`` (for example ``pr/25`` ). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used. 
       
      * For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used. 
       
      * For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use. 
       

       

      If ``sourceVersion`` is specified at the build level, then that version takes precedence over this ``sourceVersion`` (at the project level). 

       

      For more information, see `Source Version Sample with CodeBuild <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-source-version.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

    :type artifacts: dict
    :param artifacts: 

      Information to be changed about the build output artifacts for the build project.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project has build output generated through AWS CodePipeline.  

        .. note::

           The ``CODEPIPELINE`` type is not supported for ``secondaryArtifacts`` . 

         
         
        * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project does not produce any build output. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3. 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the build output artifact location:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
         

        

      
      - **path** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, ``path`` is not used. 
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

           
          * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
           
          * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
           

         
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **name** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket. 
         

         

        For example:

         

         
        * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .  
         
        * If ``path`` is empty, ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.  
         
        * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>`` .  
         

        

      
      - **packaging** *(string) --* 

        The type of build output artifact to create:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

           
          * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that contains the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
           
          * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that contains the build output. 
           

         
         

        

      
      - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

        If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

        

      
      - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

        Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException is thrown. 

        

      
      - **artifactIdentifier** *(string) --* 

        An identifier for this artifact definition. 

        

      
      - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

         

        By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

          NONE  

        The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

          READ_ONLY  

        The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

          FULL  

        The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

         

         
        * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
         
        * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
         

         

        For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

          The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

           

           
          * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project has build output generated through AWS CodePipeline.  

          .. note::

             The ``CODEPIPELINE`` type is not supported for ``secondaryArtifacts`` . 

           
           
          * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project does not produce any build output. 
           
          * ``S3`` : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3. 
           

          

        
        - **location** *(string) --* 

          Information about the build output artifact location:

           

           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
           

          

        
        - **path** *(string) --* 

          Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

           

           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, ``path`` is not used. 
           

           

          For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

          

        
        - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

          Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

           

           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

             
            * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
             
            * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
             

           
           

           

          For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .

          

        
        - **name** *(string) --* 

          Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

           

           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket. 
           

           

          For example:

           

           
          * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .  
           
          * If ``path`` is empty, ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.  
           
          * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>`` .  
           

          

        
        - **packaging** *(string) --* 

          The type of build output artifact to create:

           

           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
           
          * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

             
            * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that contains the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
             
            * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that contains the build output. 
             

           
           

          

        
        - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

          If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

          

        
        - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

          Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException is thrown. 

          

        
        - **artifactIdentifier** *(string) --* 

          An identifier for this artifact definition. 

          

        
        - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

           

          By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

            NONE  

          The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

            READ_ONLY  

          The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

            FULL  

          The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

           

           
          * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
           
          * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
           

           

          For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

            

        
      
  
    :type cache: dict
    :param cache: 

      Stores recently used information so that it can be quickly accessed at a later time.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project does not use any cache. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project reads and writes from and to S3. 
         
        * ``LOCAL`` : The build project stores a cache locally on a build host that is only available to that build host. 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the cache location: 

         

         
        * ``NO_CACHE`` or ``LOCAL`` : This value is ignored. 
         
        * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
         

        

      
      - **modes** *(list) --* 

        An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for ``LOCAL`` cache types.

         

        Possible values are:

          LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

        Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

          LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

        Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

         

        .. note::

           

           
          * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
           
          * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
           
          * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
           

           

          LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

        Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

         

         
        * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
         
        * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
         
        * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.  
         

          

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    
    :type environment: dict
    :param environment: 

      Information to be changed about the build environment for the build project.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of build environment to use for related builds.

         

         
        * The environment type ``ARM_CONTAINER`` is available only in regions US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and EU (Frankfurt). 
         
        * The environment type ``LINUX_CONTAINER`` with compute type ``build.general1.2xlarge`` is available only in regions US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), China (Beijing), and China (Ningxia). 
         
        * The environment type ``LINUX_GPU_CONTAINER`` is available only in regions US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney) , China (Beijing), and China (Ningxia). 
         

        

      
      - **image** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The image tag or image digest that identifies the Docker image to use for this build project. Use the following formats:

         

         
        * For an image tag: ``<registry>/<repository>:<tag>`` . For example, in the Docker repository that CodeBuild uses to manage its Docker images, this would be ``aws/codebuild/standard:4.0`` .  
         
        * For an image digest: ``<registry>/<repository>@<digest>`` . For example, to specify an image with the digest "sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf," use ``<registry>/<repository>@sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf`` . 
         

        

      
      - **computeType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Information about the compute resources the build project uses. Available values include:

         

         
        * ``BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL`` : Use up to 3 GB memory and 2 vCPUs for builds. 
         
        * ``BUILD_GENERAL1_MEDIUM`` : Use up to 7 GB memory and 4 vCPUs for builds. 
         
        * ``BUILD_GENERAL1_LARGE`` : Use up to 16 GB memory and 8 vCPUs for builds, depending on your environment type. 
         
        * ``BUILD_GENERAL1_2XLARGE`` : Use up to 145 GB memory, 72 vCPUs, and 824 GB of SSD storage for builds. This compute type supports Docker images up to 100 GB uncompressed. 
         

         

        If you use ``BUILD_GENERAL1_LARGE`` : 

         

         
        * For environment type ``LINUX_CONTAINER`` , you can use up to 15 GB memory and 8 vCPUs for builds.  
         
        * For environment type ``LINUX_GPU_CONTAINER`` , you can use up to 255 GB memory, 32 vCPUs, and 4 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs for builds. 
         
        * For environment type ``ARM_CONTAINER`` , you can use up to 16 GB memory and 8 vCPUs on ARM-based processors for builds. 
         

         

        For more information, see `Build Environment Compute Types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-compute-types.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide.*  

        

      
      - **environmentVariables** *(list) --* 

        A set of environment variables to make available to builds for this build project.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Information about an environment variable for a build project or a build.

          

        
          - **name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The name or key of the environment variable.

            

          
          - **value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The value of the environment variable.

             

            .. warning::

               

              We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

               

            

          
          - **type** *(string) --* 

            The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

             

             
            * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a parameter store environment variable, see `env/parameter-store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
             
            * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
             
            * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
             

            

          
        
    
      - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

        Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

         

        You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

         

        If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

         

         ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

         

         ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

         

        If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

         

         ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

         

         ``- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

        

      
      - **certificate** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object key that contains the PEM-encoded certificate for the build project. For more information, see `certificate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project-cli.html#cli.environment.certificate>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

        

      
      - **registryCredential** *(dict) --* 

        The credentials for access to a private registry.

        

      
        - **credential** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of credentials created using AWS Secrets Manager. 

           

          .. note::

             

            The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

             

          

        
        - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

          

        
      
      - **imagePullCredentialsType** *(string) --* 

        The type of credentials AWS CodeBuild uses to pull images in your build. There are two valid values: 

         

         
        * ``CODEBUILD`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.  
         
        * ``SERVICE_ROLE`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.  
         

         

        When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials. 

        

      
    
    :type serviceRole: string
    :param serviceRole: 

      The replacement ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that enables AWS CodeBuild to interact with dependent AWS services on behalf of the AWS account.

      

    
    :type timeoutInMinutes: integer
    :param timeoutInMinutes: 

      The replacement value in minutes, from 5 to 480 (8 hours), for AWS CodeBuild to wait before timing out any related build that did not get marked as completed.

      

    
    :type queuedTimeoutInMinutes: integer
    :param queuedTimeoutInMinutes: 

      The number of minutes a build is allowed to be queued before it times out. 

      

    
    :type encryptionKey: string
    :param encryptionKey: 

      The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to be used for encrypting the build output artifacts.

       

      .. note::

         

        You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build output artifacts if your service role has permission to that key. 

         

       

      You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format ``alias/<alias-name>`` ). 

      

    
    :type tags: list
    :param tags: 

      An updated list of tag key and value pairs associated with this build project.

       

      These tags are available for use by AWS services that support AWS CodeBuild build project tags.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A tag, consisting of a key and a value.

         

        This tag is available for use by AWS services that support tags in AWS CodeBuild.

        

      
        - **key** *(string) --*

            NONE  

          The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

            READ_ONLY

            FULL  

          The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

           

           
          * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
           
          * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
           

           

          For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

            

        
      
    
    :type fileSystemLocations: list
    :param fileSystemLocations: 

      An array of ``ProjectFileSystemLocation`` objects for a CodeBuild build project. A ``ProjectFileSystemLocation`` object specifies the ``identifier`` , ``location`` , ``mountOptions`` , ``mountPoint`` , and ``type`` of a file system created using Amazon Elastic File System. 

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Information about a file system created by Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). For more information, see `What Is Amazon Elastic File System? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html>`__  

        

      
        - **type** *(string) --* 

          The type of the file system. The one supported type is ``EFS`` . 

          

        
        - **location** *(string) --* 

          A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

           

          The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system. 

          

        
        - **mountPoint** *(string) --* 

          The location in the container where you mount the file system. 

          

        
        - **identifier** *(string) --* 

          The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

           

          The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

          

        
        - **mountOptions** *(string) --* 

          The mount options for a file system created by AWS EFS. The default mount options used by CodeBuild are ``nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2`` . For more information, see `Recommended NFS Mount Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-nfs-mount-settings.html>`__ .

        - **maximumBuildsAllowed** *(integer) --* 

          Specifies the maximum number of builds allowed.

          

        
        - **computeTypesAllowed** *(list) --* 

          An array of strings that specify the compute types that are allowed for the batch build. See `Build environment compute types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-compute-types.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* for these values. 

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
      - **timeoutInMins** *(integer) --* 

        Specifies the maximum amount of time, in minutes, that the batch build must be completed in.

        

      
    
    :type concurrentBuildLimit: integer
    :param concurrentBuildLimit: 

      The maximum number of concurrent builds that are allowed for this project.

       

      New builds are only started if the current number of builds is less than or equal to this limit. If the current build count meets this limit, new builds are throttled and are not run.

       

      To remove this limit, set this value to -1.

          - **sourceVersion** *(string) --* 

            A version of the build input to be built for this project. If not specified, the latest version is used. If specified, it must be one of:

             

             
            * For AWS CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use. 
             
            * For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format ``pr/pull-request-ID`` (for example ``pr/25`` ). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used. 
             
            * For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used. 
             
            * For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use. 
             

             

            If ``sourceVersion`` is specified at the build level, then that version takes precedence over this ``sourceVersion`` (at the project level). 

             

            For more information, see `Source Version Sample with CodeBuild <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-source-version.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 

            
          

          - **secondarySourceVersions** *(list) --*

                * For AWS CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use. 
                 
                * For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format ``pr/pull-request-ID`` (for example, ``pr/25`` ). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

            - **type** *(string) --* 

              The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

               

               
              * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project has build output generated through AWS CodePipeline.  

              .. note::

                 The ``CODEPIPELINE`` type is not supported for ``secondaryArtifacts`` . 

               
               
              * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project does not produce any build output. 
               
              * ``S3`` : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3. 
               

              
            

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the build output artifact location:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
               

              
            

            - **path** *(string) --* 

              Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, ``path`` is not used. 
               

               

              For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

              
            

            - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

              Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

                 
                * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
                 
                * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
                 

               
               

               

              For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .

              
            

            - **name** *(string) --* 

              Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket. 
               

               

              For example:

               

               
              * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .  
               
              * If ``path`` is empty, ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.  
               
              * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>`` .  
               

              
            

            - **packaging** *(string) --* 

              The type of build output artifact to create:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

                 
                * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that contains the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
                 
                * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that contains the build output. 
                 

               
               

              
            

            - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

              If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

              
            

            - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

              Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException is thrown. 

              
            

            - **artifactIdentifier** *(string) --* 

              An identifier for this artifact definition. 

              
            

            - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

              Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

               

              By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                NONE  

              The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                READ_ONLY  

              The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                FULL  

              The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

               

               
              * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
               
              * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
               

               

              For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

                For example:

                 

                 
                * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip`` .  
                 
                * If ``path`` is empty, ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.  
                 
                * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", the output artifact is stored in ``MyArtifacts/<build-ID>`` .  
                 

                
              

              - **packaging** *(string) --* 

                The type of build output artifact to create:

                 

                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , AWS CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

                   
                  * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that contains the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
                   
                  * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that contains the build output. 
                   

                 
                 

                
              

              - **overrideArtifactName** *(boolean) --* 

                If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

                
              

              - **encryptionDisabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException is thrown. 

                
              

              - **artifactIdentifier** *(string) --* 

                An identifier for this artifact definition. 

                
              

              - **bucketOwnerAccess** *(string) --* 

                Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

                 

                By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  FULL  

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                 

                 

                For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

                  
          
        
          

          - **cache** *(dict) --* 

            Information about the cache for the build project.

            
            

            - **type** *(string) --* 

              The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:

               

               
              * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project does not use any cache. 
               
              * ``S3`` : The build project reads and writes from and to S3. 
               
              * ``LOCAL`` : The build project stores a cache locally on a build host that is only available to that build host. 
               

              
            

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the cache location: 

               

               
              * ``NO_CACHE`` or ``LOCAL`` : This value is ignored. 
               
              * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
               

              
            

            - **modes** *(list) --* 

              An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for ``LOCAL`` cache types.

               

              Possible values are:

                LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE  

              Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored. 

                LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE  

              Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network. 

               

              .. note::

                 

                 
                * You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.  
                 
                * The ``privileged`` flag must be set so that your project has the required Docker permissions.  
                 
                * You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.  
                 

                 

                LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE  

              Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache: 

               

               
              * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.  
               
              * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.  
               
              * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.  
               

                
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
        
          

          - **environment** *(dict) --* 

            Information about the build environment for this build project.

            
            

            - **type** *(string) --* 

              The type of build environment to use for related builds.

               

               
              * The environment type ``ARM_CONTAINER`` is available only in regions US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and EU (Frankfurt). 
               
              * The environment type ``LINUX_CONTAINER`` with compute type ``build.general1.2xlarge`` is available only in regions US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), China (Beijing), and China (Ningxia).

Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney) , China (Beijing), and China (Ningxia). 
               

              
            

            - **image** *(string) --* 

              The image tag or image digest that identifies the Docker image to use for this build project. Use the following formats:

               

               
              * For an image tag: ``<registry>/<repository>:<tag>`` . For example, in the Docker repository that CodeBuild uses to manage its Docker images, this would be ``aws/codebuild/standard:4.0`` .  
               
              * For an image digest: ``<registry>/<repository>@<digest>`` . For example, to specify an image with the digest "sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf," use ``<registry>/<repository>@sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf`` . 
               

              
            

            - **computeType** *(string) --* 

              Information about the compute resources the build project uses. Available values include:

               

               
              * ``BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL`` : Use up to 3 GB memory and 2 vCPUs for builds.

              * ``BUILD_GENERAL1_2XLARGE`` : Use up to 145 GB memory, 72 vCPUs, and 824 GB of SSD storage for builds. This compute type supports Docker images up to 100 GB uncompressed. 
               

               

              If you use ``BUILD_GENERAL1_LARGE`` : 

               

               
              * For environment type ``LINUX_CONTAINER`` , you can use up to 15 GB memory and 8 vCPUs for builds.  
               
              * For environment type ``LINUX_GPU_CONTAINER`` , you can use up to 255 GB memory, 32 vCPUs, and 4 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs for builds.

            - **environmentVariables** *(list) --* 

              A set of environment variables to make available to builds for this build project.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Information about an environment variable for a build project or a build.

                
                

                - **name** *(string) --* 

                  The name or key of the environment variable.

                  
                

                - **value** *(string) --* 

                  The value of the environment variable.

                   

                  .. warning::

                     

                    We strongly discourage the use of ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. ``PLAINTEXT`` environment variables can be displayed in plain text using the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environment variable of type ``PARAMETER_STORE`` or ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` . 

                     

                  
                

                - **type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                   

                   
                  * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a parameter store environment variable, see `env/parameter-store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   
                  * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plain text format. This is the default value. 
                   
                  * ``SECRETS_MANAGER`` : An environment variable stored in AWS Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environment variable, see `env/secrets-manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* . 
                   

                  
            
          
            

            - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

              Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails. The default setting is ``false`` .

               

              You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

               

              If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

               

              If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous command does not work, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&``  

               

               ``- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

              
            

            - **certificate** *(string) --* 

              The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object key that contains the PEM-encoded certificate for the build project. For more information, see `certificate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project-cli.html#cli.environment.certificate>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* .

              
            

            - **registryCredential** *(dict) --* 

              The credentials for access to a private registry.

              
              

              - **credential** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of credentials created using AWS Secrets Manager. 

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The ``credential`` can use the name of the credentials only if they exist in your current AWS Region. 

                   

                
              

              - **credentialProvider** *(string) --* 

                The service that created the credentials to access a private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for AWS Secrets Manager. 

                
          
            

            - **imagePullCredentialsType** *(string) --* 

              The type of credentials AWS CodeBuild uses to pull images in your build. There are two valid values: 

               

               
              * ``CODEBUILD`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.  
               
              * ``SERVICE_ROLE`` specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.  
               

               

              When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials. 

              
        
          

          - **serviceRole** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that enables AWS CodeBuild to interact with dependent AWS services on behalf of the AWS account.

            
          

          - **timeoutInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

            How long, in minutes, from 5 to 480 (8 hours), for AWS CodeBuild to wait before timing out any related build that did not get marked as completed. The default is 60 minutes.

            
          

          - **queuedTimeoutInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

            The number of minutes a build is allowed to be queued before it times out. 

            
          

          - **encryptionKey** *(string) --* 

            The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to be used for encrypting the build output artifacts.

             

            .. note::

               

              You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build output artifacts if your service role has permission to that key. 

               

             

            You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format ``alias/<alias-name>`` ). 

            
          

          - **tags** *(list) --* 

            A list of tag key and value pairs associated with this build project.

            - **branchFilter** *(string) --* 

              A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the regular expression, then it is built. If ``branchFilter`` is empty, then all branches are built.

               

              .. note::

                 

                It is recommended that you use ``filterGroups`` instead of ``branchFilter`` . 

                 

              
            

            - **filterGroups** *(list) --* 

              An array of arrays of ``WebhookFilter`` objects used to determine which webhooks are triggered. At least one ``WebhookFilter`` in the array must specify ``EVENT`` as its ``type`` . 

               

              For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the ``filterGroups`` array must pass. For a filter group to pass, each of its filters must pass. 

              
              

              - *(list) --*

                  - **type** *(string) --* 

                    The type of webhook filter. There are six webhook filter types: ``EVENT`` , ``ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID`` , ``HEAD_REF`` , ``BASE_REF`` , ``FILE_PATH`` , and ``COMMIT_MESSAGE`` . 

                      EVENT   

                    A webhook event triggers a build when the provided ``pattern`` matches one of five event types: ``PUSH`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_CREATED`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`` , and ``PULL_REQUEST_MERGED`` . The ``EVENT`` patterns are specified as a comma-separated string. For example, ``PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` filters all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events. 

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      The ``PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`` works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise only. 

                       

                      ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID   

                    A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . 

                      HEAD_REF   

                    A webhook event triggers a build when the head reference matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . For example, ``refs/heads/branch-name`` and ``refs/tags/tag-name`` . 

                     

                    Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub and GitHub Enterprise pull request, Bitbucket push, and Bitbucket pull request events. 

                      BASE_REF   

                    A webhook event triggers a build when the base reference matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . For example, ``refs/heads/branch-name`` . 

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      Works with pull request events only. 

                       

                      FILE_PATH   

                    A webhook triggers a build when the path of a changed file matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . 

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events. 

                       

                      COMMIT_MESSAGE  

                    A webhook triggers a build when the head commit message matches the regular expression ``pattern`` .

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events. 

                       

                      
                  

                  - **pattern** *(string) --* 

                    For a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses ``EVENT`` type, a comma-separated string that specifies one or more events. For example, the webhook filter ``PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` allows all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events to trigger a build. 

                     

                    For a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses any of the other filter types, a regular expression pattern. For example, a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses ``HEAD_REF`` for its ``type`` and the pattern ``^refs/heads/`` triggers a build when the head reference is a branch with a reference name ``refs/heads/branch-name`` . 

                    
                  

                  - **excludeMatchedPattern** *(boolean) --* 

                    Used to indicate that the ``pattern`` determines which webhook events do not trigger a build. If true, then a webhook event that does not match the ``pattern`` triggers a build. If false, then a webhook event that matches the ``pattern`` triggers a build.

                Specifies the access for objects that are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by another account.

                 

                By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                  NONE  

                The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.

                  READ_ONLY  

                The bucket owner has read only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

                  FULL  

                The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                 

                 
                * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred** setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. 
                 
                * Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. 
                 

                 

                For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see `Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide* .

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`` , and its mount directory is ``my-efs-mount-directory`` , then the ``location`` is ``fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`` . 

                 

                The directory path in the format ``efs-dns-name:/directory-path`` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system. 

                
              

              - **mountPoint** *(string) --*

              - **identifier** *(string) --* 

                The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the ``identifier`` in all capital letters to ``CODEBUILD_`` . For example, if you specify ``my_efs`` for ``identifier`` , a new environment variable is create named ``CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`` . 

                 

                The ``identifier`` is used to mount your file system. 

                
              

              - **mountOptions** *(string) --* 

                The mount options for a file system created by AWS EFS. The default mount options used by CodeBuild are ``nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2`` . For more information, see `Recommended NFS Mount Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-nfs-mount-settings.html>`__ .

            - **combineArtifacts** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies if the build artifacts for the batch build should be combined into a single artifact location.

              
            

            - **restrictions** *(dict) --* 

              A ``BatchRestrictions`` object that specifies the restrictions for the batch build.

              
              

              - **maximumBuildsAllowed** *(integer) --* 

                Specifies the maximum number of builds allowed.

                
              

              - **computeTypesAllowed** *(list) --* 

                An array of strings that specify the compute types that are allowed for the batch build. See `Build environment compute types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-compute-types.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide* for these values.

      - *(list) --* 

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A filter used to determine which webhooks trigger a build. 

          

        
          - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The type of webhook filter. There are six webhook filter types: ``EVENT`` , ``ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID`` , ``HEAD_REF`` , ``BASE_REF`` , ``FILE_PATH`` , and ``COMMIT_MESSAGE`` . 

              EVENT   

            A webhook event triggers a build when the provided ``pattern`` matches one of five event types: ``PUSH`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_CREATED`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`` , and ``PULL_REQUEST_MERGED`` . The ``EVENT`` patterns are specified as a comma-separated string. For example, ``PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` filters all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events. 

             

            .. note::

               

              The ``PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`` works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise only. 

               

              ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID   

            A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . 

              HEAD_REF   

            A webhook event triggers a build when the head reference matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . For example, ``refs/heads/branch-name`` and ``refs/tags/tag-name`` . 

             

            Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub and GitHub Enterprise pull request, Bitbucket push, and Bitbucket pull request events. 

              BASE_REF   

            A webhook event triggers a build when the base reference matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . For example, ``refs/heads/branch-name`` . 

             

            .. note::

               

              Works with pull request events only. 

               

              FILE_PATH   

            A webhook triggers a build when the path of a changed file matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . 

             

            .. note::

               

              Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events. 

               

              COMMIT_MESSAGE  

            A webhook triggers a build when the head commit message matches the regular expression ``pattern`` .

             

            .. note::

               

              Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events. 

               

              

          
          - **pattern** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            For a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses ``EVENT`` type, a comma-separated string that specifies one or more events. For example, the webhook filter ``PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` allows all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events to trigger a build. 

             

            For a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses any of the other filter types, a regular expression pattern. For example, a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses ``HEAD_REF`` for its ``type`` and the pattern ``^refs/heads/`` triggers a build when the head reference is a branch with a reference name ``refs/heads/branch-name`` . 

            

          
          - **excludeMatchedPattern** *(boolean) --* 

            Used to indicate that the ``pattern`` determines which webhook events do not trigger a build. If true, then a webhook event that does not match the ``pattern`` triggers a build. If false, then a webhook event that matches the ``pattern`` triggers a build. 

            

          
        
    
  
    :type buildType: string
    :param buildType: 

      Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.

          - **filterGroups** *(list) --* 

            An array of arrays of ``WebhookFilter`` objects used to determine which webhooks are triggered. At least one ``WebhookFilter`` in the array must specify ``EVENT`` as its ``type`` . 

             

            For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the ``filterGroups`` array must pass. For a filter group to pass, each of its filters must pass. 

            
            

            - *(list) --* 
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A filter used to determine which webhooks trigger a build. 

                
                

                - **type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of webhook filter. There are six webhook filter types: ``EVENT`` , ``ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID`` , ``HEAD_REF`` , ``BASE_REF`` , ``FILE_PATH`` , and ``COMMIT_MESSAGE`` . 

                    EVENT   

                  A webhook event triggers a build when the provided ``pattern`` matches one of five event types: ``PUSH`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_CREATED`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` , ``PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`` , and ``PULL_REQUEST_MERGED`` . The ``EVENT`` patterns are specified as a comma-separated string. For example, ``PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` filters all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events. 

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    The ``PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`` works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise only. 

                     

                    ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID   

                  A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . 

                    HEAD_REF   

                  A webhook event triggers a build when the head reference matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . For example, ``refs/heads/branch-name`` and ``refs/tags/tag-name`` . 

                   

                  Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub and GitHub Enterprise pull request, Bitbucket push, and Bitbucket pull request events. 

                    BASE_REF   

                  A webhook event triggers a build when the base reference matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . For example, ``refs/heads/branch-name`` . 

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Works with pull request events only. 

                     

                    FILE_PATH   

                  A webhook triggers a build when the path of a changed file matches the regular expression ``pattern`` . 

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events. 

                     

                    COMMIT_MESSAGE  

                  A webhook triggers a build when the head commit message matches the regular expression ``pattern`` .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events. 

                     

                    
                

                - **pattern** *(string) --* 

                  For a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses ``EVENT`` type, a comma-separated string that specifies one or more events. For example, the webhook filter ``PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`` allows all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events to trigger a build. 

                   

                  For a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses any of the other filter types, a regular expression pattern. For example, a ``WebHookFilter`` that uses ``HEAD_REF`` for its ``type`` and the pattern ``^refs/heads/`` triggers a build when the head reference is a branch with a reference name ``refs/heads/branch-name`` . 

                  
                

                - **excludeMatchedPattern** *(boolean) --* 

                  Used to indicate that the ``pattern`` determines which webhook events do not trigger a build. If true, then a webhook event that does not match the ``pattern`` triggers a build. If false, then a webhook event that matches the ``pattern`` triggers a build. 

                  
            
          
        
          

          - **buildType** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.

            
          

          - **lastModifiedSecret** *(datetime) --* 

            A timestamp that indicates the last time a repository's secret token was modified.
