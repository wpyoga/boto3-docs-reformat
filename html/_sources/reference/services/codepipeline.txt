.. py:class:: CodePipeline.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS CodePipeline
   

   **Overview**  

   

  This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the actions and data types for AWS CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline can only be configured through the API. For more information, see the `AWS CodePipeline User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html>`__ .

   

  You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, and transitions.

   

   *Pipelines* are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions. 

   

  You can work with pipelines by calling:

   

   
  *  CreatePipeline , which creates a uniquely named pipeline. 
   
  *  DeletePipeline , which deletes the specified pipeline. 
   
  *  GetPipeline , which returns information about the pipeline structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource Name (ARN). 
   
  *  GetPipelineExecution , which returns information about a specific execution of a pipeline. 
   
  *  GetPipelineState , which returns information about the current state of the stages and actions of a pipeline. 
   
  *  ListActionExecutions , which returns action-level details for past executions. The details include full stage and action-level details, including individual action duration, status, any errors that occurred during the execution, and input and output artifact location details. 
   
  *  ListPipelines , which gets a summary of all of the pipelines associated with your account. 
   
  *  ListPipelineExecutions , which gets a summary of the most recent executions for a pipeline. 
   
  *  StartPipelineExecution , which runs the most recent revision of an artifact through the pipeline. 
   
  *  StopPipelineExecution , which stops the specified pipeline execution from continuing through the pipeline. 
   
  *  UpdatePipeline , which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to the structure of the pipeline. 
   

   

  Pipelines include *stages* . Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or failure. If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call  GetPipelineState , which displays the status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or  GetPipeline , which returns the entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the structure of stages and actions, see `AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html>`__ .

   

  Pipeline stages include *actions* that are categorized into categories such as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as  CreatePipeline and  GetPipelineState . Valid action categories are:

   

   
  * Source 
   
  * Build 
   
  * Test 
   
  * Deploy 
   
  * Approval 
   
  * Invoke 
   

   

  Pipelines also include *transitions* , which allow the transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage complete.

   

  You can work with transitions by calling:

   

   
  *  DisableStageTransition , which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline. 
   
  *  EnableStageTransition , which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline.  
   

   

   **Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline**  

   

  For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers need to work with the following items:

   

   **Jobs** , which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source. 

   

  You can work with jobs by calling:

   

   
  *  AcknowledgeJob , which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job. 
   
  *  GetJobDetails , which returns the details of a job. 
   
  *  PollForJobs , which determines whether there are any jobs to act on. 
   
  *  PutJobFailureResult , which provides details of a job failure.  
   
  *  PutJobSuccessResult , which provides details of a job success. 
   

   

   **Third party jobs** , which are instances of an action created by a partner action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by members of the AWS Partner Network.

   

  You can work with third party jobs by calling:

   

   
  *  AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob , which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job. 
   
  *  GetThirdPartyJobDetails , which requests the details of a job for a partner action. 
   
  *  PollForThirdPartyJobs , which determines whether there are any jobs to act on.  
   
  *  PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult , which provides details of a job failure. 
   
  *  PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult , which provides details of a job success.

    :param category: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The category of the custom action, such as a build action or a test action.

      

    
    :type provider: string
    :param provider: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The provider of the service used in the custom action, such as AWS CodeDeploy.

      

    
    :type version: string
    :param version: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The version identifier of the custom action.

      

    
    :type settings: dict
    :param settings: 

      URLs that provide users information about this custom action.

      

    
      - **thirdPartyConfigurationUrl** *(string) --* 

        The URL of a sign-up page where users can sign up for an external service and perform initial configuration of the action provided by that service.

        

      
      - **entityUrlTemplate** *(string) --* 

        The URL returned to the AWS CodePipeline console that provides a deep link to the resources of the external system, such as the configuration page for an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group. This link is provided as part of the action display in the pipeline.

        

      
      - **executionUrlTemplate** *(string) --* 

        The URL returned to the AWS CodePipeline console that contains a link to the top-level landing page for the external system, such as the console page for AWS CodeDeploy. This link is shown on the pipeline view page in the AWS CodePipeline console and provides a link to the execution entity of the external action.

        

      
      - **revisionUrlTemplate** *(string) --* 

        The URL returned to the AWS CodePipeline console that contains a link to the page where customers can update or change the configuration of the external action.

        

      
    
    :type configurationProperties: list
    :param configurationProperties: 

      The configuration properties for the custom action.

       

      .. note::

         

        You can refer to a name in the configuration properties of the custom action within the URL templates by following the format of {Config:name}, as long as the configuration property is both required and not secret. For more information, see `Create a Custom Action for a Pipeline <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/how-to-create-custom-action.html>`__ .

         

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents information about an action configuration property.

        

      
        - **name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the action configuration property.

          

        
        - **required** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Whether the configuration property is a required value.

          

        
        - **key** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Whether the configuration property is a key.

          

        
        - **secret** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Whether the configuration property is secret. Secrets are hidden from all calls except for ``GetJobDetails`` , ``GetThirdPartyJobDetails`` , ``PollForJobs`` , and ``PollForThirdPartyJobs`` .

           

          When updating a pipeline, passing * * * * * without changing any other values of the action preserves the previous value of the secret.

          

        
        - **queryable** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates that the property is used with ``PollForJobs`` . When creating a custom action, an action can have up to one queryable property. If it has one, that property must be both required and not secret.

           

          If you create a pipeline with a custom action type, and that custom action contains a queryable property, the value for that configuration property is subject to other restrictions. The value must be less than or equal to twenty (20) characters. The value can contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens.

          

        
        - **description** *(string) --* 

          The description of the action configuration property that is displayed to users.

          

        
        - **type** *(string) --*

    :type tags: list
    :param tags: 

      The tags for the custom action.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A tag is a key-value pair that is used to manage the resource.

        

      
        - **key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The tag's key.

  .. py:method:: delete_custom_action_type(**kwargs)

    

    Marks a custom action as deleted. ``PollForJobs`` for the custom action fails after the action is marked for deletion. Used for custom actions only.

     

    .. warning::

       

      To re-create a custom action after it has been deleted you must use a string in the version field that has never been used before. This string can be an incremented version number, for example. To restore a deleted custom action, use a JSON file that is identical to the deleted action, including the original string in the version field.

    Create a paginator for an operation.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :raise OperationNotPageableError: Raised if the operation is not
        pageable.  You can use the ``client.can_paginate`` method to
        check if an operation is pageable.
    
    :rtype: L{botocore.paginate.Paginator}
    :return: A paginator object.


  .. py:method:: get_pipeline(**kwargs)

    

    Returns the metadata, structure, stages, and actions of a pipeline. Can be used to return the entire structure of a pipeline in JSON format, which can then be modified and used to update the pipeline structure with  UpdatePipeline .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents the output of a ``GetPipeline`` action.

        
        

        - **pipeline** *(dict) --* 

          Represents the structure of actions and stages to be performed in the pipeline. 

          
          

          - **name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the pipeline.

            
          

          - **roleArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for AWS CodePipeline to use to either perform actions with no ``actionRoleArn`` , or to use to assume roles for actions with an ``actionRoleArn`` .

            
          

          - **artifactStore** *(dict) --* 

            Represents information about the S3 bucket where artifacts are stored for the pipeline.

             

            .. note::

               

              You must include either ``artifactStore`` or ``artifactStores`` in your pipeline, but you cannot use both. If you create a cross-region action in your pipeline, you must use ``artifactStores`` .

               

            
            

            - **type** *(string) --*

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              The S3 bucket used for storing the artifacts for a pipeline. You can specify the name of an S3 bucket but not a folder in the bucket. A folder to contain the pipeline artifacts is created for you based on the name of the pipeline. You can use any S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the pipeline to store your pipeline artifacts.

              
            

            - **encryptionKey** *(dict) --*

              - **executionUrlTemplate** *(string) --* 

                The URL returned to the AWS CodePipeline console that contains a link to the top-level landing page for the external system, such as the console page for AWS CodeDeploy. This link is shown on the pipeline view page in the AWS CodePipeline console and provides a link to the execution entity of the external action.

                
              

              - **revisionUrlTemplate** *(string) --*

                The maximum number of artifacts allowed for the action type.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

          If the amount of returned information is significantly large, an identifier is also returned. It can be used in a subsequent list action types call to return the next set of action types in the list.

                    The value selected by the ``JsonPath`` expression must match what is supplied in the ``MatchEquals`` field. Otherwise, the request is ignored. Properties from the target action configuration can be included as placeholders in this value by surrounding the action configuration key with curly brackets. For example, if the value supplied here is "refs/heads/{Branch}" and the target action has an action configuration property called "Branch" with a value of "master", the ``MatchEquals`` value is evaluated as "refs/heads/master".

            - **url** *(string) --* 

              A unique URL generated by CodePipeline. When a POST request is made to this URL, the defined pipeline is started as long as the body of the post request satisfies the defined authentication and filtering conditions. Deleting and re-creating a webhook makes the old URL invalid and generates a new one.

  .. py:method:: put_webhook(**kwargs)

    

    Defines a webhook and returns a unique webhook URL generated by CodePipeline. This URL can be supplied to third party source hosting providers to call every time there's a code change. When CodePipeline receives a POST request on this URL, the pipeline defined in the webhook is started as long as the POST request satisfied the authentication and filtering requirements supplied when defining the webhook. RegisterWebhookWithThirdParty and DeregisterWebhookWithThirdParty APIs can be used to automatically configure supported third parties to call the generated webhook URL.

    :type webhook: dict
    :param webhook: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The detail provided in an input file to create the webhook, such as the webhook name, the pipeline name, and the action name. Give the webhook a unique name that helps you identify it. You might name the webhook after the pipeline and action it targets so that you can easily recognize what it's used for later.

      

    
      - **name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of the webhook.

      - **targetAction** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of the action in a pipeline you want to connect to the webhook. The action must be from the source (first) stage of the pipeline.

        

      
      - **filters** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A list of rules applied to the body/payload sent in the POST request to a webhook URL. All defined rules must pass for the request to be accepted and the pipeline started.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          The event criteria that specify when a webhook notification is sent to your URL.

          

        
          - **jsonPath** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            A JsonPath expression that is applied to the body/payload of the webhook. The value selected by the JsonPath expression must match the value specified in the ``MatchEquals`` field. Otherwise, the request is ignored. For more information, see `Java JsonPath implementation <https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath>`__ in GitHub.

            

          
          - **matchEquals** *(string) --* 

            The value selected by the ``JsonPath`` expression must match what is supplied in the ``MatchEquals`` field. Otherwise, the request is ignored. Properties from the target action configuration can be included as placeholders in this value by surrounding the action configuration key with curly brackets. For example, if the value supplied here is "refs/heads/{Branch}" and the target action has an action configuration property called "Branch" with a value of "master", the ``MatchEquals`` value is evaluated as "refs/heads/master". For a list of action configuration properties for built-in action types, see `Pipeline Structure Reference Action Requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#action-requirements>`__ .

        * IP rejects webhooks trigger requests unless they originate from an IP address in the IP range whitelisted in the authentication configuration. 
         
        * UNAUTHENTICATED accepts all webhook trigger requests regardless of origin. 
         

        

      
      - **authenticationConfiguration** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Properties that configure the authentication applied to incoming webhook trigger requests. The required properties depend on the authentication type. For GITHUB_HMAC, only the ``SecretToken`` property must be set. For IP, only the ``AllowedIPRange`` property must be set to a valid CIDR range. For UNAUTHENTICATED, no properties can be set.

        

      
        - **AllowedIPRange** *(string) --* 

          The property used to configure acceptance of webhooks in an IP address range. For IP, only the ``AllowedIPRange`` property must be set. This property must be set to a valid CIDR range.

                  - **name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The name of the artifact to be worked on (for example, "My App").

                     

                    The input artifact of an action must exactly match the output artifact declared in a preceding action, but the input artifact does not have to be the next action in strict sequence from the action that provided the output artifact. Actions in parallel can declare different output artifacts, which are in turn consumed by different following actions.

                    

                  
                
            
              - **roleArn** *(string) --* 

                The ARN of the IAM service role that performs the declared action. This is assumed through the roleArn for the pipeline.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents the output of an ``UpdatePipeline`` action.

        
        

        - **pipeline** *(dict) --* 

          The structure of the updated pipeline.

          
          

          - **name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the pipeline.

            
          

          - **roleArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for AWS CodePipeline to use to either perform actions with no ``actionRoleArn`` , or to use to assume roles for actions with an ``actionRoleArn`` .

            
          

          - **artifactStore** *(dict) --* 

            Represents information about the S3 bucket where artifacts are stored for the pipeline.

             

            .. note::

               

              You must include either ``artifactStore`` or ``artifactStores`` in your pipeline, but you cannot use both. If you create a cross-region action in your pipeline, you must use ``artifactStores`` .

               

            
            

            - **type** *(string) --* 

              The type of the artifact store, such as S3.

              
            

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              The S3 bucket used for storing the artifacts for a pipeline. You can specify the name of an S3 bucket but not a folder in the bucket. A folder to contain the pipeline artifacts is created for you based on the name of the pipeline. You can use any S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the pipeline to store your pipeline artifacts.

              
            

            - **encryptionKey** *(dict) --*

              - **owner** *(string) --* 

                The creator of the action being called. There are three valid values for the ``Owner`` field in the action category section within your pipeline structure: ``AWS`` , ``ThirdParty`` , and ``Custom`` . For more information, see `Valid Action Types and Providers in CodePipeline <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#actions-valid-providers>`__ .

                
              

              - **provider** *(string) --* 

                The provider of the service being called by the action. Valid providers are determined by the action category. For example, an action in the Deploy category type might have a provider of AWS CodeDeploy, which would be specified as CodeDeploy. For more information, see `Valid Action Types and Providers in CodePipeline <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#actions-valid-providers>`__ .

              - **thirdPartyConfigurationUrl** *(string) --* 

                The URL of a sign-up page where users can sign up for an external service and perform initial configuration of the action provided by that service.

                
              

              - **entityUrlTemplate** *(string) --* 

                The URL returned to the AWS CodePipeline console that provides a deep link to the resources of the external system, such as the configuration page for an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group. This link is provided as part of the action display in the pipeline.

                
              

              - **executionUrlTemplate** *(string) --* 

                The URL returned to the AWS CodePipeline console that contains a link to the top-level landing page for the external system, such as the console page for AWS CodeDeploy. This link is shown on the pipeline view page in the AWS CodePipeline console and provides a link to the execution entity of the external action.

                
              

              - **revisionUrlTemplate** *(string) --*

              - *(dict) --* 

                Represents information about an action configuration property.

                
                

                - **name** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the action configuration property.

                  
                

                - **required** *(boolean) --*

                  When updating a pipeline, passing * * * * * without changing any other values of the action preserves the previous value of the secret.

                  
                

                - **queryable** *(boolean) --* 

                  Indicates that the property is used with ``PollForJobs`` . When creating a custom action, an action can have up to one queryable property. If it has one, that property must be both required and not secret.

                   

                  If you create a pipeline with a custom action type, and that custom action contains a queryable property, the value for that configuration property is subject to other restrictions. The value must be less than or equal to twenty (20) characters. The value can contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens.

                The name of the pipeline you want to connect to the webhook.

                
              

              - **targetAction** *(string) --* 

                The name of the action in a pipeline you want to connect to the webhook. The action must be from the source (first) stage of the pipeline.

                
              

              - **filters** *(list) --* 

                A list of rules applied to the body/payload sent in the POST request to a webhook URL. All defined rules must pass for the request to be accepted and the pipeline started.

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  The event criteria that specify when a webhook notification is sent to your URL.

                  
                  

                  - **jsonPath** *(string) --* 

                    A JsonPath expression that is applied to the body/payload of the webhook. The value selected by the JsonPath expression must match the value specified in the ``MatchEquals`` field. Otherwise, the request is ignored. For more information, see `Java JsonPath implementation <https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath>`__ in GitHub.

                    
                  

                  - **matchEquals** *(string) --* 

                    The value selected by the ``JsonPath`` expression must match what is supplied in the ``MatchEquals`` field. Otherwise, the request is ignored. Properties from the target action configuration can be included as placeholders in this value by surrounding the action configuration key with curly brackets. For example, if the value supplied here is "refs/heads/{Branch}" and the target action has an action configuration property called "Branch" with a value of "master", the ``MatchEquals`` value is evaluated as "refs/heads/master". For a list of action configuration properties for built-in action types, see `Pipeline Structure Reference Action Requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#action-requirements>`__ .

                * For information about the authentication scheme implemented by GITHUB_HMAC, see `Securing your webhooks <https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/>`__ on the GitHub Developer website. 
                 
                * IP rejects webhooks trigger requests unless they originate from an IP address in the IP range whitelisted in the authentication configuration. 
                 
                * UNAUTHENTICATED accepts all webhook trigger requests regardless of origin. 
                 

                
              

              - **authenticationConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                Properties that configure the authentication applied to incoming webhook trigger requests. The required properties depend on the authentication type. For GITHUB_HMAC, only the ``SecretToken`` property must be set. For IP, only the ``AllowedIPRange`` property must be set to a valid CIDR range. For UNAUTHENTICATED, no properties can be set.

                
                

                - **AllowedIPRange** *(string) --*

            - **url** *(string) --* 

              A unique URL generated by CodePipeline. When a POST request is made to this URL, the defined pipeline is started as long as the body of the post request satisfies the defined authentication and filtering conditions. Deleting and re-creating a webhook makes the old URL invalid and generates a new one.

              
            

            - **errorMessage** *(string) --* 

              The text of the error message about the webhook.

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the webhook.

              
            

            - **tags** *(list) --* 

              Specifies the tags applied to the webhook.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A tag is a key-value pair that is used to manage the resource.

                
                

                - **key** *(string) --*
