.. py:class:: SecretsManager.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Secrets Manager
   

  AWS Secrets Manager provides a service to enable you to store, manage, and retrieve, secrets.

   

  This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information about using this service, see the `AWS Secrets Manager User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/introduction.html>`__ .

   

   **API Version**  

   

  This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17.

   

  .. note::

     

    As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs provide cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including downloading and installing them, see `Tools for Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/>`__ .

     

   

  We recommend you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Secrets Manager. However, you also can use the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To learn more about the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API, see `Making Query Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/query-requests.html>`__ in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide* . 

   

  Secrets Manager API supports GET and POST requests for all actions, and doesn't require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.

   

   **Support and Feedback for AWS Secrets Manager**  

   

  We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to `awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com <mailto:awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com>`__ , or post your feedback and questions in the `AWS Secrets Manager Discussion Forum <http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=296>`__ . For more information about the AWS Discussion Forums, see `Forums Help <http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa>`__ .

   

   **How examples are presented**  

   

  The JSON that AWS Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters and the service returns as a response to HTTP query requests contain single, long strings without line breaks or white space formatting. The JSON shown in the examples displays the code formatted with both line breaks and white space to improve readability. When example input parameters can also cause long strings extending beyond the screen, you can insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON text string.

   

   **Logging API Requests**  

   

  AWS Secrets Manager supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Secrets Manager and support for AWS CloudTrail, see `Logging AWS Secrets Manager Events with AWS CloudTrail <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail>`__ in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide* . To learn more about CloudTrail, including enabling it and find your log files, see the `AWS CloudTrail User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html>`__ .

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: cancel_rotate_secret(**kwargs)

    

    Disables automatic scheduled rotation and cancels the rotation of a secret if currently in progress.

     

    To re-enable scheduled rotation, call  RotateSecret with ``AutomaticallyRotateAfterDays`` set to a value greater than 0. This immediately rotates your secret and then enables the automatic schedule.

     

    .. note::

       

      If you cancel a rotation while in progress, it can leave the ``VersionStage`` labels in an unexpected state. Depending on the step of the rotation in progress, you might need to remove the staging label ``AWSPENDING`` from the partially created version, specified by the ``VersionId`` response value. You should also evaluate the partially rotated new version to see if it should be deleted, which you can do by removing all staging labels from the new version ``VersionStage`` field.

       

     

    To successfully start a rotation, the staging label ``AWSPENDING`` must be in one of the following states:

     

     
    * Not attached to any version at all 
     
    * Attached to the same version as the staging label ``AWSCURRENT``   
     

     

    If the staging label ``AWSPENDING`` attached to a different version than the version with ``AWSCURRENT`` then the attempt to rotate fails.

     

     **Minimum permissions**  

     

    To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

     

     
    * secretsmanager:CancelRotateSecret 
     

     

     **Related operations**  

     

     
    * To configure rotation for a secret or to manually trigger a rotation, use  RotateSecret . 
     
    * To get the rotation configuration details for a secret, use  DescribeSecret . 
     
    * To list all of the currently available secrets, use  ListSecrets . 
     
    * To list all of the versions currently associated with a secret, use  ListSecretVersionIds .

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.cancel_rotate_secret(
          SecretId='string'
      )
    :type SecretId: string
    :param SecretId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the secret to cancel a rotation request. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.

       

      .. note::

         

        If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.

         

        If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a *ResourceNotFoundException* or an *AccessDeniedException* error, depending on your permissions.

         

      

    
    
    :rtype: dict

      **Response Syntax** 

      
      ::

        {
            'ARN': 'string',
            'Name': 'string',
            'VersionId': 'string'
        }
      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **ARN** *(string) --* 

          The ARN of the secret for which rotation was canceled.

          
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The friendly name of the secret for which rotation was canceled.

          
        

        - **VersionId** *(string) --* 

          The unique identifier of the version of the secret created during the rotation. This version might not be complete, and should be evaluated for possible deletion. At the very least, you should remove the ``VersionStage`` value ``AWSPENDING`` to enable this version to be deleted. Failing to clean up a cancelled rotation can block you from successfully starting future rotations.

          
    
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`SecretsManager.Client.exceptions.ResourceNotFoundException`

    
    *     :py:class:`SecretsManager.Client.exceptions.InvalidParameterException`

    
    *     :py:class:`SecretsManager.Client.exceptions.InternalServiceError`

    
    *     :py:class:`SecretsManager.Client.exceptions.InvalidRequestException`

    

    **Examples** 

    The following example shows how to cancel rotation for a secret. The operation sets the RotationEnabled field to false and cancels all scheduled rotations. To resume scheduled rotations, you must re-enable rotation by calling the rotate-secret operation.
    ::

      response = client.cancel_rotate_secret(
          SecretId='MyTestDatabaseSecret',
      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

      {
          'ARN': 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3',
          'Name': 'Name',
          'ResponseMetadata': {
              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: create_secret(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new secret. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret.

     

    Secrets Manager stores the encrypted secret data in one of a collection of "versions" associated with the secret. Each version contains a copy of the encrypted secret data. Each version is associated with one or more "staging labels" that identify where the version is in the rotation cycle. The ``SecretVersionsToStages`` field of the secret contains the mapping of staging labels to the active versions of the secret. Versions without a staging label are considered deprecated and not included in the list.

     

    You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in either the ``SecretString`` parameter or binary data in the ``SecretBinary`` parameter, but not both. If you include ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` then Secrets Manager also creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` to the new version.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * If you call an operation to encrypt or decrypt the ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias ``aws/secretsmanager`` . If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS creating the account's AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result. 
       
      * If the secret resides in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the ``KMSKeyId`` . If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations. 
       

       

     

     

     

     **Minimum permissions**  

     

    To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

     

     
    * secretsmanager:CreateSecret 
     
    * kms:GenerateDataKey - needed only if you use a customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt the secret. You do not need this permission to use the account default AWS managed CMK for Secrets Manager. 
     
    * kms:Decrypt - needed only if you use a customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt the secret. You do not need this permission to use the account default AWS managed CMK for Secrets Manager. 
     
    * secretsmanager:TagResource - needed only if you include the ``Tags`` parameter.  
     

     

     **Related operations**  

     

     
    * To delete a secret, use  DeleteSecret . 
     
    * To modify an existing secret, use  UpdateSecret . 
     
    * To create a new version of a secret, use  PutSecretValue . 
     
    * To retrieve the encrypted secure string and secure binary values, use  GetSecretValue . 
     
    * To retrieve all other details for a secret, use  DescribeSecret . This does not include the encrypted secure string and secure binary values. 
     
    * To retrieve the list of secret versions associated with the current secret, use  DescribeSecret and examine the ``SecretVersionsToStages`` response value.

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.create_secret(
          Name='string',
          ClientRequestToken='string',
          Description='string',
          KmsKeyId='string',
          SecretBinary=b'bytes',
          SecretString='string',
          Tags=[
              {
                  'Key': 'string',
                  'Value': 'string'
              },
          ],
          AddReplicaRegions=[
              {
                  'Region': 'string',
                  'KmsKeyId': 'string'
              },
          ],
          ForceOverwriteReplicaSecret=True|False
      )
    :type Name: string
    :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the friendly name of the new secret.

       

      The secret name must be ASCII letters, digits, or the following characters : /_+=.@-

       

      .. note::

         

        Do not end your secret name with a hyphen followed by six characters. If you do so, you risk confusion and unexpected results when searching for a secret by partial ARN. Secrets Manager automatically adds a hyphen and six random characters at the end of the ARN.

         

      

    
    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      (Optional) If you include ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` , then an initial version is created as part of the secret, and this parameter specifies a unique identifier for the new version. 

       

      .. note::

         

        If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ``ClientRequestToken`` yourself for the new version and include the value in the request.

         

       

      This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a `UUID-type <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__ value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret. 

       

       
      * If the ``ClientRequestToken`` value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.  
       
      * If a version with this value already exists and the version ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` values are the same as those in the request, then the request is ignored. 
       
      * If a version with this value already exists and that version's ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` values are different from those in the request, then the request fails because you cannot modify an existing version. Instead, use  PutSecretValue to create a new version. 
       

       

      This value becomes the ``VersionId`` of the new version.

      This field is autopopulated if not provided.

    
    :type Description: string
    :param Description: 

      (Optional) Specifies a user-provided description of the secret.

      

    
    :type KmsKeyId: string
    :param KmsKeyId: 

      (Optional) Specifies the ARN, Key ID, or alias of the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) to be used to encrypt the ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` values in the versions stored in this secret.

       

      You can specify any of the supported ways to identify a AWS KMS key ID. If you need to reference a CMK in a different account, you can use only the key ARN or the alias ARN.

       

      If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager defaults to using the AWS account's default CMK (the one named ``aws/secretsmanager`` ). If a AWS KMS CMK with that name doesn't yet exist, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically the first time it needs to encrypt a version's ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` fields.

       

      .. warning::

         

        You can use the account default CMK to encrypt and decrypt only if you call this operation using credentials from the same account that owns the secret. If the secret resides in a different account, then you must create a custom CMK and specify the ARN in this field. 

         

      

    
    :type SecretBinary: bytes
    :param SecretBinary: 

      (Optional) Specifies binary data that you want to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the contents of the file as a parameter.

       

      Either ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty.

       

      This parameter is not available using the Secrets Manager console. It can be accessed only by using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.

      

    
    :type SecretString: string
    :param SecretString: 

      (Optional) Specifies text data that you want to encrypt and store in this new version of the secret.

       

      Either ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty.

       

      If you create a secret by using the Secrets Manager console then Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the ``SecretString`` parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the Lambda rotation function knows how to parse.

       

      For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see `Using JSON for Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json>`__ in the *AWS CLI User Guide* . For example:

       

       ``{"username":"bob","password":"abc123xyz456"}``  

       

      If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. 

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      (Optional) Specifies a list of user-defined tags that are attached to the secret. Each tag is a "Key" and "Value" pair of strings. This operation only appends tags to the existing list of tags. To remove tags, you must use  UntagResource .

       

      .. warning::

         

         
        * Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key "ABC" is a different tag from one with key "abc". 
         
        * If you check tags in IAM policy ``Condition`` elements as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the successful completion of this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then this operation is blocked and returns an ``Access Denied`` error. 
         

         

       

      This parameter requires a JSON text string argument. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see `Using JSON for Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json>`__ in the *AWS CLI User Guide* . For example:

       

       ``[{"Key":"CostCenter","Value":"12345"},{"Key":"environment","Value":"production"}]``  

       

      If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. 

       

      The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

       

       
      * Maximum number of tags per secret—50 
       
      * Maximum key length—127 Unicode characters in UTF-8 
       
      * Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters in UTF-8 
       
      * Tag keys and values are case sensitive. 
       
      * Do not use the ``aws:`` prefix in your tag names or values because AWS reserves it for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret limit. 
       
      * If you use your tagging schema across multiple services and resources, remember other services might have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters: letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @. 
       

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A structure that contains information about a tag.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* 

          The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* 

          The string value associated with the key of the tag.

          

        
      
  
    :type AddReplicaRegions: list
    :param AddReplicaRegions: 

      (Optional) Add a list of regions to replicate secrets. Secrets Manager replicates the KMSKeyID objects to the list of regions specified in the parameter.

      

    
      - *(dict) --*

          .. note::

             

            Secrets Manager automatically adds several random characters to the name at the end of the ARN when you initially create a secret. This affects only the ARN and not the actual friendly name. This ensures that if you create a new secret with the same name as an old secret that you previously deleted, then users with access to the old secret *don't* automatically get access to the new secret because the ARNs are different.

             

          
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The friendly name of the secret that you just created.

  .. py:method:: delete_resource_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the resource-based permission policy attached to the secret.

     

     **Minimum permissions**  

     

    To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

     

     
    * secretsmanager:DeleteResourcePolicy 
     

     

     **Related operations**  

     

     
    * To attach a resource policy to a secret, use  PutResourcePolicy . 
     
    * To retrieve the current resource-based policy attached to a secret, use  GetResourcePolicy . 
     
    * To list all of the currently available secrets, use  ListSecrets .

          SecretId='string'
      )
    :type SecretId: string
    :param SecretId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the secret that you want to delete the attached resource-based policy for. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.

       

      .. note::

         

        If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.

         

        If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a *ResourceNotFoundException* or an *AccessDeniedException* error, depending on your permissions.

      }

    

  .. py:method:: delete_secret(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes an entire secret and all of the versions. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the secret. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a ``DeletionDate`` stamp to the secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently.

     

    At any time before recovery window ends, you can use  RestoreSecret to remove the ``DeletionDate`` and cancel the deletion of the secret.

     

    You cannot access the encrypted secret information in any secret scheduled for deletion. If you need to access that information, you must cancel the deletion with  RestoreSecret and then retrieve the information.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * There is no explicit operation to delete a version of a secret. Instead, remove all staging labels from the ``VersionStage`` field of a version. That marks the version as deprecated and allows Secrets Manager to delete it as needed. Versions without any staging labels do not show up in  ListSecretVersionIds unless you specify ``IncludeDeprecated`` . 
       
      * The permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period is performed as a background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for the actual delete operation to occur. 
       

       

     

     **Minimum permissions**  

     

    To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

     

     
    * secretsmanager:DeleteSecret 
     

     

     **Related operations**  

     

     
    * To create a secret, use  CreateSecret . 
     
    * To cancel deletion of a version of a secret before the recovery window has expired, use  RestoreSecret .

    :type RecoveryWindowInDays: integer
    :param RecoveryWindowInDays: 

      (Optional) Specifies the number of days that Secrets Manager waits before Secrets Manager can delete the secret. You can't use both this parameter and the ``ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery`` parameter in the same API call.

       

      This value can range from 7 to 30 days with a default value of 30.

      (Optional) Specifies that the secret is to be deleted without any recovery window. You can't use both this parameter and the ``RecoveryWindowInDays`` parameter in the same API call.

       

      An asynchronous background process performs the actual deletion, so there can be a short delay before the operation completes. If you write code to delete and then immediately recreate a secret with the same name, ensure that your code includes appropriate back off and retry logic.

       

      .. warning::

         

        Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the operation to skip the normal waiting period before the permanent deletion that AWS would normally impose with the ``RecoveryWindowInDays`` parameter. If you delete a secret with the ``ForceDeleteWithouRecovery`` parameter, then you have no opportunity to recover the secret. You lose the secret permanently.

         

       

      .. warning::

         

        If you use this parameter and include a previously deleted or nonexistent secret, the operation does not return the error ``ResourceNotFoundException`` in order to correctly handle retries.

          To enable rotation, use  RotateSecret with ``AutomaticallyRotateAfterDays`` set to a value greater than 0. To disable rotation, use  CancelRotateSecret .

          
        

        - **RotationLambdaARN** *(string) --* 

          The ARN of a Lambda function that's invoked by Secrets Manager to rotate the secret either automatically per the schedule or manually by a call to ``RotateSecret`` .

          
        

        - **RotationRules** *(dict) --* 

          A structure with the rotation configuration for this secret.

          
          

          - **AutomaticallyAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

            Specifies the number of days between automatic scheduled rotations of the secret.

             

            Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one is complete. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load.

            
      
        

        - **LastRotatedDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The last date and time that the rotation process for this secret was invoked.

           

          The most recent date and time that the Secrets Manager rotation process successfully completed. If the secret doesn't rotate, Secrets Manager returns a null value.

          
        

        - **LastChangedDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The last date and time that this secret was modified in any way.

          
        

        - **LastAccessedDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The last date that this secret was accessed. This value is truncated to midnight of the date and therefore shows only the date, not the time.

          
        

        - **DeletedDate** *(datetime) --* 

          This value exists if the secret is scheduled for deletion. Some time after the specified date and time, Secrets Manager deletes the secret and all of its versions.

           

          If a secret is scheduled for deletion, then its details, including the encrypted secret information, is not accessible. To cancel a scheduled deletion and restore access, use  RestoreSecret .

          
        

        - **Tags** *(list) --* 

          The list of user-defined tags that are associated with the secret. To add tags to a secret, use  TagResource . To remove tags, use  UntagResource .

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A structure that contains information about a tag.

              The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The string value associated with the key of the tag.

              
        
      
        

        - **VersionIdsToStages** *(dict) --* 

          A list of all of the currently assigned ``VersionStage`` staging labels and the ``VersionId`` that each is attached to. Staging labels are used to keep track of the different versions during the rotation process.

           

          .. note::

             

            A version that does not have any staging labels attached is considered deprecated and subject to deletion. Such versions are not included in this list.

             

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
            

            - *(list) --*

        - **PrimaryRegion** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the primary region for secret replication. 

          
        

        - **ReplicationStatus** *(list) --* 

          Describes a list of replication status objects as ``InProgress`` , ``Failed`` or ``InSync`` .``P``  

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A replication object consisting of a ``RegionReplicationStatus`` object and includes a Region, KMSKeyId, status, and status message.

            
            

            - **Region** *(string) --* 

              The Region where replication occurs.

          SecretId='string'
      )
    :type SecretId: string
    :param SecretId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the secret that you want to retrieve the attached resource-based policy for. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.

       

      .. note::

         

        If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.

         

        If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a *ResourceNotFoundException* or an *AccessDeniedException* error, depending on your permissions.

      Specifies the secret version that you want to retrieve by the staging label attached to the version.

       

      Staging labels are used to keep track of different versions during the rotation process. If you specify both this parameter and ``VersionId`` , the two parameters must refer to the same secret version . If you don't specify either a ``VersionStage`` or ``VersionId`` , then the default is to perform the operation on the version with the ``VersionStage`` value of ``AWSCURRENT`` .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **ARN** *(string) --* 

          The ARN of the secret.

          
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The friendly name of the secret.

          
        

        - **VersionId** *(string) --* 

          The unique identifier of this version of the secret.

          
        

        - **SecretBinary** *(bytes) --* 

          The decrypted part of the protected secret information that was originally provided as binary data in the form of a byte array. The response parameter represents the binary data as a `base64-encoded <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4>`__ string.

           

          This parameter is not used if the secret is created by the Secrets Manager console.

           

          If you store custom information in this field of the secret, then you must code your Lambda rotation function to parse and interpret whatever you store in the ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` fields.

          
        

        - **SecretString** *(string) --* 

          The decrypted part of the protected secret information that was originally provided as a string.

           

          If you create this secret by using the Secrets Manager console then only the ``SecretString`` parameter contains data. Secrets Manager stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the Lambda rotation function knows how to parse.

           

          If you store custom information in the secret by using the  CreateSecret ,  UpdateSecret , or  PutSecretValue API operations instead of the Secrets Manager console, or by using the **Other secret type** in the console, then you must code your Lambda rotation function to parse and interpret those values.

          
        

        - **VersionStages** *(list) --* 

          A list of all of the staging labels currently attached to this version of the secret.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **CreatedDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time that this version of the secret was created.

          
    
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`SecretsManager.Client.exceptions.ResourceNotFoundException`

    **Examples** 

    The following example shows how to retrieve the secret string value from the version of the secret that has the AWSPREVIOUS staging label attached. If you want to retrieve the AWSCURRENT version of the secret, then you can omit the VersionStage parameter because it defaults to AWSCURRENT.
    ::

      response = client.get_secret_value(
          SecretId='MyTestDatabaseSecret',
          VersionStage='AWSPREVIOUS',
      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

    Returns an object that can wait for some condition.
    
    :type waiter_name: str
    :param waiter_name: The name of the waiter to get. See the waiters
        section of the service docs for a list of available waiters.
    
    :returns: The specified waiter object.
    :rtype: botocore.waiter.Waiter


  .. py:method:: list_secret_version_ids(**kwargs)

    

    Lists all of the versions attached to the specified secret. The output does not include the ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` fields. By default, the list includes only versions that have at least one staging label in ``VersionStage`` attached.

     

    .. note::

       

      Always check the ``NextToken`` response parameter when calling any of the ``List*`` operations. These operations can occasionally return an empty or shorter than expected list of results even when there more results become available. When this happens, the ``NextToken`` response parameter contains a value to pass to the next call to the same API to request the next part of the list.

       

     

     **Minimum permissions**  

     

    To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

     

     
    * secretsmanager:ListSecretVersionIds 
     

     

     **Related operations**

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.list_secret_version_ids(
          SecretId='string',
          MaxResults=123,
          NextToken='string',
          IncludeDeprecated=True|False
      )
    :type SecretId: string
    :param SecretId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The identifier for the secret containing the versions you want to list. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.

       

      .. note::

         

        If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.

         

        If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a *ResourceNotFoundException* or an *AccessDeniedException* error, depending on your permissions.

         

      

    
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      (Optional) Limits the number of results you want to include in the response. If you don't include this parameter, it defaults to a value that's specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``NextToken`` response element is present and has a value (isn't null). Include that value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Secrets Manager might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

      

    
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      (Optional) Use this parameter in a request if you receive a ``NextToken`` response in a previous request indicating there's more output available. In a subsequent call, set it to the value of the previous call ``NextToken`` response to indicate where the output should continue from.

      

    
    :type IncludeDeprecated: boolean
    :param IncludeDeprecated: 

      (Optional) Specifies that you want the results to include versions that do not have any staging labels attached to them. Such versions are considered deprecated and are subject to deletion by Secrets Manager as needed.

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          If present in the response, this value indicates that there's more output available than included in the current response. This can occur even when the response includes no values at all, such as when you ask for a filtered view of a very long list. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to continue processing and get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back empty (as ``null`` ).

          
        

        - **ARN** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the secret.

           

          .. note::

             

            Secrets Manager automatically adds several random characters to the name at the end of the ARN when you initially create a secret. This affects only the ARN and not the actual friendly name. This ensures that if you create a new secret with the same name as an old secret that you previously deleted, then users with access to the old secret *don't* automatically get access to the new secret because the ARNs are different.

             

          
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The friendly name of the secret.

              The friendly name of the secret. You can use forward slashes in the name to represent a path hierarchy. For example, ``/prod/databases/dbserver1`` could represent the secret for a server named ``dbserver1`` in the folder ``databases`` in the folder ``prod`` . 

              
            

            - **Description** *(string) --* 

              The user-provided description of the secret.

              
            

            - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --* 

              The ARN or alias of the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) used to encrypt the ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` fields in each version of the secret. If you don't provide a key, then Secrets Manager defaults to encrypting the secret fields with the default KMS CMK, the key named ``awssecretsmanager`` , for this account.

              
            

            - **RotationEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

              Indicates whether automatic, scheduled rotation is enabled for this secret.

              
            

            - **RotationLambdaARN** *(string) --* 

              The ARN of an AWS Lambda function invoked by Secrets Manager to rotate and expire the secret either automatically per the schedule or manually by a call to  RotateSecret .

              
            

            - **RotationRules** *(dict) --* 

              A structure that defines the rotation configuration for the secret.

              
              

              - **AutomaticallyAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

                Specifies the number of days between automatic scheduled rotations of the secret.

                 

                Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one is complete. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load.

                
          
            

            - **LastRotatedDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The most recent date and time that the Secrets Manager rotation process was successfully completed. This value is null if the secret hasn't ever rotated.

              
            

            - **LastChangedDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The last date and time that this secret was modified in any way.

              
            

            - **LastAccessedDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The last date that this secret was accessed. This value is truncated to midnight of the date and therefore shows only the date, not the time.

              
            

            - **DeletedDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time the deletion of the secret occurred. Not present on active secrets. The secret can be recovered until the number of days in the recovery window has passed, as specified in the ``RecoveryWindowInDays`` parameter of the  DeleteSecret operation.

              
            

            - **Tags** *(list) --* 

              The list of user-defined tags associated with the secret. To add tags to a secret, use  TagResource . To remove tags, use  UntagResource .

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A structure that contains information about a tag.

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The string value associated with the key of the tag.

                  
            
          
            

            - **SecretVersionsToStages** *(dict) --* 

              A list of all of the currently assigned ``SecretVersionStage`` staging labels and the ``SecretVersionId`` attached to each one. Staging labels are used to keep track of the different versions during the rotation process.

               

              .. note::

                 

                A version that does not have any ``SecretVersionStage`` is considered deprecated and subject to deletion. Such versions are not included in this list.

                 

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
                

                - *(list) --* 
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
          
        
            

            - **OwningService** *(string) --* 

              Returns the name of the service that created the secret.

              
            

            - **CreatedDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time when a secret was created.

              
            

            - **PrimaryRegion** *(string) --* 

              The Region where Secrets Manager originated the secret.

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          If present in the response, this value indicates that there's more output available than included in the current response. This can occur even when the response includes no values at all, such as when you ask for a filtered view of a very long list. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to continue processing and get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back empty (as ``null`` ).

  .. py:method:: put_resource_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Attaches the contents of the specified resource-based permission policy to a secret. A resource-based policy is optional. Alternatively, you can use IAM identity-based policies that specify the secret's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the policy statement's ``Resources`` element. You can also use a combination of both identity-based and resource-based policies. The affected users and roles receive the permissions that are permitted by all of the relevant policies. For more information, see `Using Resource-Based Policies for AWS Secrets Manager <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_resource-based-policies.html>`__ . For the complete description of the AWS policy syntax and grammar, see `IAM JSON Policy Reference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

     **Minimum permissions**  

     

    To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

     

     
    * secretsmanager:PutResourcePolicy 
     

     

     **Related operations**  

     

     
    * To retrieve the resource policy attached to a secret, use  GetResourcePolicy . 
     
    * To delete the resource-based policy attached to a secret, use  DeleteResourcePolicy . 
     
    * To list all of the currently available secrets, use  ListSecrets .

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.put_resource_policy(
          SecretId='string',
          ResourcePolicy='string',
          BlockPublicPolicy=True|False
      )
    :type SecretId: string
    :param SecretId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the secret that you want to attach the resource-based policy. You can specify either the ARN or the friendly name of the secret.

       

      .. note::

         

        If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.

         

        If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a *ResourceNotFoundException* or an *AccessDeniedException* error, depending on your permissions.

         

      

    
    :type ResourcePolicy: string
    :param ResourcePolicy: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A JSON-formatted string constructed according to the grammar and syntax for an AWS resource-based policy. The policy in the string identifies who can access or manage this secret and its versions. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see `Using JSON for Parameters <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json>`__ in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

      

    
    :type BlockPublicPolicy: boolean
    :param BlockPublicPolicy: 

      (Optional) If you set the parameter, ``BlockPublicPolicy`` to true, then you block resource-based policies that allow broad access to the secret.

    **Examples** 

    The following example shows how to add a resource-based policy to a secret.
    ::

      response = client.put_resource_policy(
          ResourcePolicy='{\n"Version":"2012-10-17",\n"Statement":[{\n"Effect":"Allow",\n"Principal":{\n"AWS":"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"\n},\n"Action":"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",\n"Resource":"*"\n}]\n}',
          SecretId='MyTestDatabaseSecret',
      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

      {
          'ARN': 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3',
          'Name': 'MyTestDatabaseSecret',
          'ResponseMetadata': {
              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: put_secret_value(**kwargs)

    

    Stores a new encrypted secret value in the specified secret. To do this, the operation creates a new version and attaches it to the secret. The version can contain a new ``SecretString`` value or a new ``SecretBinary`` value. You can also specify the staging labels that are initially attached to the new version.

     

    .. note::

       

      The Secrets Manager console uses only the ``SecretString`` field. To add binary data to a secret with the ``SecretBinary`` field you must use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.

       

     

     
    * If this operation creates the first version for the secret then Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` to the new version. 
     
    * If you do not specify a value for VersionStages then Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` to this new version. 
     
    * If this operation moves the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` from another version to this version, then Secrets Manager also automatically moves the staging label ``AWSPREVIOUS`` to the version that ``AWSCURRENT`` was removed from. 
     
    * This operation is idempotent. If a version with a ``VersionId`` with the same value as the ``ClientRequestToken`` parameter already exists and you specify the same secret data, the operation succeeds but does nothing. However, if the secret data is different, then the operation fails because you cannot modify an existing version; you can only create new ones. 
     

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * If you call an operation to encrypt or decrypt the ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias ``aws/secretsmanager`` . If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS creating the account's AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result. 
       
      * If the secret resides in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the ``KMSKeyId`` . If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations. 
       

       

     

     **Minimum permissions**  

     

    To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

     

     
    * secretsmanager:PutSecretValue 
     
    * kms:GenerateDataKey - needed only if you use a customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt the secret. You do not need this permission to use the account's default AWS managed CMK for Secrets Manager. 
     

     

     **Related operations**  

     

     
    * To retrieve the encrypted value you store in the version of a secret, use  GetSecretValue . 
     
    * To create a secret, use  CreateSecret . 
     
    * To get the details for a secret, use  DescribeSecret . 
     
    * To list the versions attached to a secret, use  ListSecretVersionIds .

              'string',
          ]
      )
    :type SecretId: string
    :param SecretId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the secret to which you want to add a new version. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret. The secret must already exist.

       

      .. note::

    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      (Optional) Specifies a unique identifier for the new version of the secret. 

       

      .. note::

         

        If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes that in the request. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ``ClientRequestToken`` yourself for new versions and include that value in the request. 

         

       

      This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during the Lambda rotation function's processing. We recommend that you generate a `UUID-type <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__ value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret. 

       

       
      * If the ``ClientRequestToken`` value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.  
       
      * If a version with this value already exists and that version's ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` values are the same as those in the request then the request is ignored (the operation is idempotent).  
       
      * If a version with this value already exists and the version of the ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` values are different from those in the request then the request fails because you cannot modify an existing secret version. You can only create new versions to store new secret values. 
       

       

      This value becomes the ``VersionId`` of the new version.

      This field is autopopulated if not provided.

    
    :type SecretBinary: bytes
    :param SecretBinary: 

      (Optional) Specifies binary data that you want to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the contents of the file as a parameter. Either ``SecretBinary`` or ``SecretString`` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty.

       

      This parameter is not accessible if the secret using the Secrets Manager console.

       

      

      

    
    :type SecretString: string
    :param SecretString: 

      (Optional) Specifies text data that you want to encrypt and store in this new version of the secret. Either ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty.

       

      If you create this secret by using the Secrets Manager console then Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the ``SecretString`` parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the default Lambda rotation function knows how to parse.

       

      For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see `Using JSON for Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json>`__ in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

       

      For example:

       

       ``[{"username":"bob"},{"password":"abc123xyz456"}]``  

       

      If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text.

      

    
    :type VersionStages: list
    :param VersionStages: 

      (Optional) Specifies a list of staging labels that are attached to this version of the secret. These staging labels are used to track the versions through the rotation process by the Lambda rotation function.

       

      A staging label must be unique to a single version of the secret. If you specify a staging label that's already associated with a different version of the same secret then that staging label is automatically removed from the other version and attached to this version.

       

      If you do not specify a value for ``VersionStages`` then Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` to this new version.

      Specifies the secret that you want to restore from a previously scheduled deletion. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.

       

      .. note::

         

        If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.

         

        If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a *ResourceNotFoundException* or an *AccessDeniedException* error, depending on your permissions.

    **Examples** 

    The following example shows how to restore a secret that you previously scheduled for deletion.
    ::

          SecretId='MyTestDatabaseSecret',
      )

              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: rotate_secret(**kwargs)

    

    Configures and starts the asynchronous process of rotating this secret. If you include the configuration parameters, the operation sets those values for the secret and then immediately starts a rotation. If you do not include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a rotation with the values already stored in the secret. After the rotation completes, the protected service and its clients all use the new version of the secret. 

     

    This required configuration information includes the ARN of an AWS Lambda function and the time between scheduled rotations. The Lambda rotation function creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the credentials on the protected service to match. After testing the new credentials, the function marks the new secret with the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` so that your clients all immediately begin to use the new version. For more information about rotating secrets and how to configure a Lambda function to rotate the secrets for your protected service, see `Rotating Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html>`__ in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide* .

     

    Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one completes. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load.

     

    The rotation function must end with the versions of the secret in one of two states:

     

     
    * The ``AWSPENDING`` and ``AWSCURRENT`` staging labels are attached to the same version of the secret, or 
     
    * The ``AWSPENDING`` staging label is not attached to any version of the secret. 
     

     

    If the ``AWSPENDING`` staging label is present but not attached to the same version as ``AWSCURRENT`` then any later invocation of ``RotateSecret`` assumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error.

     

     **Minimum permissions**  

     

    To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

     

     
    * secretsmanager:RotateSecret 
     
    * lambda:InvokeFunction (on the function specified in the secret's metadata) 
     

     

     **Related operations**  

     

     
    * To list the secrets in your account, use  ListSecrets . 
     
    * To get the details for a version of a secret, use  DescribeSecret . 
     
    * To create a new version of a secret, use  CreateSecret . 
     
    * To attach staging labels to or remove staging labels from a version of a secret, use  UpdateSecretVersionStage .

    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      (Optional) Specifies a unique identifier for the new version of the secret that helps ensure idempotency. 

       

      If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes that in the request for this parameter. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ``ClientRequestToken`` yourself for new versions and include that value in the request.

       

      You only need to specify your own value if you implement your own retry logic and want to ensure that a given secret is not created twice. We recommend that you generate a `UUID-type <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__ value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret. 

       

      Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during the function's processing. This value becomes the ``VersionId`` of the new version.

      This field is autopopulated if not provided.

        Specifies the number of days between automatic scheduled rotations of the secret.

  .. py:method:: tag_resource(**kwargs)

    

    Attaches one or more tags, each consisting of a key name and a value, to the specified secret. Tags are part of the secret's overall metadata, and are not associated with any specific version of the secret. This operation only appends tags to the existing list of tags. To remove tags, you must use  UntagResource .

     

    The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

     

     
    * Maximum number of tags per secret—50 
     
    * Maximum key length—127 Unicode characters in UTF-8 
     
    * Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters in UTF-8 
     
    * Tag keys and values are case sensitive. 
     
    * Do not use the ``aws:`` prefix in your tag names or values because AWS reserves it for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret limit. 
     
    * If you use your tagging schema across multiple services and resources, remember other services might have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters: letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @. 
     

     

    .. warning::

       

      If you use tags as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If successfully completing this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then the operation is blocked and returns an Access Denied error.

       

     

     **Minimum permissions**  

     

    To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

     

     
    * secretsmanager:TagResource 
     

     

     **Related operations**

    :param SecretId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The identifier for the secret that you want to attach tags to. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.

       

      .. note::

         

        If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.

         

        If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a *ResourceNotFoundException* or an *AccessDeniedException* error, depending on your permissions.

  .. py:method:: update_secret(**kwargs)

    

    Modifies many of the details of the specified secret. If you include a ``ClientRequestToken`` and *either*  ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` then it also creates a new version attached to the secret.

     

    To modify the rotation configuration of a secret, use  RotateSecret instead.

     

    .. note::

       

      The Secrets Manager console uses only the ``SecretString`` parameter and therefore limits you to encrypting and storing only a text string. To encrypt and store binary data as part of the version of a secret, you must use either the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.

       

     

     
    * If a version with a ``VersionId`` with the same value as the ``ClientRequestToken`` parameter already exists, the operation results in an error. You cannot modify an existing version, you can only create a new version. 
     
    * If you include ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` to create a new secret version, Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` to the new version.  
     

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * If you call an operation to encrypt or decrypt the ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias ``aws/secretsmanager`` . If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS creating the account's AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result. 
       
      * If the secret resides in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the ``KMSKeyId`` . If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations. 
       

       

     

     **Minimum permissions**  

     

    To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

     

     
    * secretsmanager:UpdateSecret 
     
    * kms:GenerateDataKey - needed only if you use a custom AWS KMS key to encrypt the secret. You do not need this permission to use the account's AWS managed CMK for Secrets Manager. 
     
    * kms:Decrypt - needed only if you use a custom AWS KMS key to encrypt the secret. You do not need this permission to use the account's AWS managed CMK for Secrets Manager.

    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      (Optional) If you want to add a new version to the secret, this parameter specifies a unique identifier for the new version that helps ensure idempotency. 

       

      If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes that in the request. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ``ClientRequestToken`` yourself for new versions and include that value in the request.

       

      You typically only need to interact with this value if you implement your own retry logic and want to ensure that a given secret is not created twice. We recommend that you generate a `UUID-type <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__ value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret. 

       

      Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during the Lambda rotation function's processing.

       

       
      * If the ``ClientRequestToken`` value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.  
       
      * If a version with this value already exists and that version's ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` values are the same as those in the request then the request is ignored (the operation is idempotent).  
       
      * If a version with this value already exists and that version's ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` values are different from the request then an error occurs because you cannot modify an existing secret value. 
       

       

      This value becomes the ``VersionId`` of the new version.

      This field is autopopulated if not provided.

    
    :type Description: string
    :param Description: 

      (Optional) Specifies an updated user-provided description of the secret.

      

    
    :type KmsKeyId: string
    :param KmsKeyId: 

      (Optional) Specifies an updated ARN or alias of the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) to be used to encrypt the protected text in new versions of this secret.

       

      .. warning::

         

        You can only use the account's default CMK to encrypt and decrypt if you call this operation using credentials from the same account that owns the secret. If the secret is in a different account, then you must create a custom CMK and provide the ARN of that CMK in this field. The user making the call must have permissions to both the secret and the CMK in their respective accounts.

         

      

    
    :type SecretBinary: bytes
    :param SecretBinary: 

      (Optional) Specifies updated binary data that you want to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the contents of the file as a parameter. Either ``SecretBinary`` or ``SecretString`` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty.

       

      This parameter is not accessible using the Secrets Manager console.

      

    
    :type SecretString: string
    :param SecretString: 

      (Optional) Specifies updated text data that you want to encrypt and store in this new version of the secret. Either ``SecretBinary`` or ``SecretString`` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty.

       

      If you create this secret by using the Secrets Manager console then Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the ``SecretString`` parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the default Lambda rotation function knows how to parse.

       

      For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see `Using JSON for Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json>`__ in the *AWS CLI User Guide* . For example:

       

       ``[{"username":"bob"},{"password":"abc123xyz456"}]``  

       

      If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. You can also 'escape' the double quote character in the embedded JSON text by prefacing each with a backslash. For example, the following string is surrounded by double-quotes. All of the embedded double quotes are escaped:

       

       ``"[{\"username\":\"bob\"},{\"password\":\"abc123xyz456\"}]"``

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **ARN** *(string) --* 

          The ARN of the secret that was updated.

           

          .. note::

             

            Secrets Manager automatically adds several random characters to the name at the end of the ARN when you initially create a secret. This affects only the ARN and not the actual friendly name. This ensures that if you create a new secret with the same name as an old secret that you previously deleted, then users with access to the old secret *don't* automatically get access to the new secret because the ARNs are different.

             

          
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The friendly name of the secret that was updated.

          
        

        - **VersionId** *(string) --* 

          If a new version of the secret was created by this operation, then ``VersionId`` contains the unique identifier of the new version.

    **Examples** 

    The following example shows how to modify the description of a secret.
    ::

      response = client.update_secret(
          ClientRequestToken='EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE',
          Description='This is a new description for the secret.',
          SecretId='MyTestDatabaseSecret',
      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

      {
          'ARN': 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3',
          'Name': 'MyTestDatabaseSecret',
          'ResponseMetadata': {
              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

    This example shows how to update the KMS customer managed key (CMK) used to encrypt the secret value. The KMS CMK must be in the same region as the secret.
    ::

      response = client.update_secret(
          KmsKeyId='arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/EXAMPLE2-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE',
          SecretId='MyTestDatabaseSecret',
      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

      {
          'ARN': 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3',
          'Name': 'MyTestDatabaseSecret',
          'ResponseMetadata': {
              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

    The following example shows how to create a new version of the secret by updating the SecretString field. Alternatively, you can use the put-secret-value operation.
    ::

      response = client.update_secret(
          SecretId='MyTestDatabaseSecret',
          SecretString='{JSON STRING WITH CREDENTIALS}',
      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

      {
          'ARN': 'aws:arn:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3',
          'Name': 'MyTestDatabaseSecret',

          'ResponseMetadata': {
              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: update_secret_version_stage(**kwargs)

    

    Modifies the staging labels attached to a version of a secret. Staging labels are used to track a version as it progresses through the secret rotation process. You can attach a staging label to only one version of a secret at a time. If a staging label to be added is already attached to another version, then it is moved--removed from the other version first and then attached to this one. For more information about staging labels, see `Staging Labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/terms-concepts.html#term_staging-label>`__ in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide* . 

     

    The staging labels that you specify in the ``VersionStage`` parameter are added to the existing list of staging labels--they don't replace it.

     

    You can move the ``AWSCURRENT`` staging label to this version by including it in this call.

     

    .. note::

       

      Whenever you move ``AWSCURRENT`` , Secrets Manager automatically moves the label ``AWSPREVIOUS`` to the version that ``AWSCURRENT`` was removed from.

       

     

    If this action results in the last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be 'deprecated' and can be deleted by Secrets Manager.

     

     **Minimum permissions**  

     

    To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

     

     
    * secretsmanager:UpdateSecretVersionStage 
     

     

     **Related operations**  

     

     
    * To get the list of staging labels that are currently associated with a version of a secret, use ``  DescribeSecret `` and examine the ``SecretVersionsToStages`` response value.

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.update_secret_version_stage(
          SecretId='string',
          VersionStage='string',
          RemoveFromVersionId='string',
          MoveToVersionId='string'
      )
    :type SecretId: string
    :param SecretId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the secret with the version with the list of staging labels you want to modify. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.

       

      .. note::

         

        If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.

         

        If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a *ResourceNotFoundException* or an *AccessDeniedException* error, depending on your permissions.

         

      

    
    :type VersionStage: string
    :param VersionStage: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The staging label to add to this version.

      

    
    :type RemoveFromVersionId: string
    :param RemoveFromVersionId: 

      Specifies the secret version ID of the version that the staging label is to be removed from. If the staging label you are trying to attach to one version is already attached to a different version, then you must include this parameter and specify the version that the label is to be removed from. If the label is attached and you either do not specify this parameter, or the version ID does not match, then the operation fails.

      

    
    :type MoveToVersionId: string
    :param MoveToVersionId: 

      (Optional) The secret version ID that you want to add the staging label. If you want to remove a label from a version, then do not specify this parameter.

       

      If the staging label is already attached to a different version of the secret, then you must also specify the ``RemoveFromVersionId`` parameter.

  .. py:method:: validate_resource_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Validates that the resource policy does not grant a wide range of IAM principals access to your secret. The JSON request string input and response output displays formatted code with white space and line breaks for better readability. Submit your input as a single line JSON string. A resource-based policy is optional for secrets.

     

    The API performs three checks when validating the secret:

     

     
    * Sends a call to `Zelkova <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/protect-sensitive-data-in-the-cloud-with-automated-reasoning-zelkova/>`__ , an automated reasoning engine, to ensure your Resource Policy does not allow broad access to your secret. 
     
    * Checks for correct syntax in a policy. 
     
    * Verifies the policy does not lock out a caller.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **SecretList** *(list) --* 

          A list of the secrets in the account.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A structure that contains the details about a secret. It does not include the encrypted ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` values. To get those values, use the  GetSecretValue operation.

            
            

            - **ARN** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

               

              For more information about ARNs in Secrets Manager, see `Policy Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_iam-permissions.html#iam-resources>`__ in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide* .

              
            

            - **Name** *(string) --* 

              The friendly name of the secret. You can use forward slashes in the name to represent a path hierarchy. For example, ``/prod/databases/dbserver1`` could represent the secret for a server named ``dbserver1`` in the folder ``databases`` in the folder ``prod`` . 

              
            

            - **Description** *(string) --* 

              The user-provided description of the secret.

              
            

            - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --* 

              The ARN or alias of the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) used to encrypt the ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` fields in each version of the secret. If you don't provide a key, then Secrets Manager defaults to encrypting the secret fields with the default KMS CMK, the key named ``awssecretsmanager`` , for this account.

              
            

            - **RotationEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

              Indicates whether automatic, scheduled rotation is enabled for this secret.

              
            

            - **RotationLambdaARN** *(string) --* 

              The ARN of an AWS Lambda function invoked by Secrets Manager to rotate and expire the secret either automatically per the schedule or manually by a call to  RotateSecret .

              
            

            - **RotationRules** *(dict) --* 

              A structure that defines the rotation configuration for the secret.

              
              

              - **AutomaticallyAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

                Specifies the number of days between automatic scheduled rotations of the secret.

                 

                Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one is complete. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load.

                
          
            

            - **LastRotatedDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The most recent date and time that the Secrets Manager rotation process was successfully completed. This value is null if the secret hasn't ever rotated.

              
            

            - **LastChangedDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The last date and time that this secret was modified in any way.

              
            

            - **LastAccessedDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The last date that this secret was accessed. This value is truncated to midnight of the date and therefore shows only the date, not the time.

              
            

            - **DeletedDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time the deletion of the secret occurred. Not present on active secrets. The secret can be recovered until the number of days in the recovery window has passed, as specified in the ``RecoveryWindowInDays`` parameter of the  DeleteSecret operation.

              
            

            - **Tags** *(list) --* 

              The list of user-defined tags associated with the secret. To add tags to a secret, use  TagResource . To remove tags, use  UntagResource .

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A structure that contains information about a tag.

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The string value associated with the key of the tag.

                  
            
          
            

            - **SecretVersionsToStages** *(dict) --* 

              A list of all of the currently assigned ``SecretVersionStage`` staging labels and the ``SecretVersionId`` attached to each one. Staging labels are used to keep track of the different versions during the rotation process.

               

              .. note::

                 

                A version that does not have any ``SecretVersionStage`` is considered deprecated and subject to deletion. Such versions are not included in this list.
