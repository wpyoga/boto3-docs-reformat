.. py:class:: Support.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Support
   

  The *AWS Support API Reference* is intended for programmers who need detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. You can use the API to manage your support cases programmatically. The AWS Support API uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.

   

  .. note::

     

     
    * You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API.  
     
    * If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the ``SubscriptionRequiredException`` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see `AWS Support <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/>`__ . 
     

     

   

  The AWS Support service also exposes a set of `AWS Trusted Advisor <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/>`__ features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks.

   

  The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:

   

   
  * Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels - The  DescribeServices and  DescribeSeverityLevels operations return AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the  CreateCase operation. 
   
  * Case creation, case details, and case resolution - The  CreateCase ,  DescribeCases ,  DescribeAttachment , and  ResolveCase operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases. 
   
  * Case communication - The  DescribeCommunications ,  AddCommunicationToCase , and  AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases. 
   

   

  The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Support service for Trusted Advisor:

   

   
  *  DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the list of checks that run against your AWS resources. 
   
  * Using the ``checkId`` for a specific check returned by  DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks , you can call  DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult to obtain the results for the check that you specified. 
   
  *  DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks. 
   
  *  RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check. 
   
  *  DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh status of one or more checks. 
   

   

  For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses `Signature Version 4 Signing Process <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__ .

   

  See `About the AWS Support API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html>`__ in the *AWS Support User Guide* for information about how to use this service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources.

  .. py:method:: add_attachments_to_set(**kwargs)

    

    Adds one or more attachments to an attachment set. 

     

    An attachment set is a temporary container for attachments that you add to a case or case communication. The set is available for 1 hour after it's created. The ``expiryTime`` returned in the response is when the set expires.

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: create_case(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is similar to how you create a case in the AWS Support Center `Create Case <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create>`__ page.

     

    The AWS Support API doesn't support requesting service limit increases. You can submit a service limit increase in the following ways: 

     

     
    * Submit a request from the AWS Support Center `Create Case <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create>`__ page. 
     
    * Use the Service Quotas `RequestServiceQuotaIncrease <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/2019-06-24/apireference/API_RequestServiceQuotaIncrease.html>`__ operation. 
     

     

    A successful ``CreateCase`` request returns an AWS Support case number. You can use the  DescribeCases operation and specify the case number to get existing AWS Support cases. After you create a case, use the  AddCommunicationToCase operation to add additional communication or attachments to an existing case.

     

    The ``caseId`` is separate from the ``displayId`` that appears in the `AWS Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support>`__ . Use the  DescribeCases operation to get the ``displayId`` .

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API.  
       
      * If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the ``SubscriptionRequiredException`` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see `AWS Support <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/>`__ .

      The code for the AWS service. You can use the  DescribeServices operation to get the possible ``serviceCode`` values.

      

    
    :type severityCode: string
    :param severityCode: 

      A value that indicates the urgency of the case. This value determines the response time according to your service level agreement with AWS Support. You can use the  DescribeSeverityLevels operation to get the possible values for ``severityCode`` . 

       

      For more information, see  SeverityLevel and `Choosing a Severity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/getting-started.html#choosing-severity>`__ in the *AWS Support User Guide* .

       

      .. note::

         

        The availability of severity levels depends on the support plan for the AWS account.

         

      

    
    :type categoryCode: string
    :param categoryCode: 

      The category of problem for the support case. You also use the  DescribeServices operation to get the category code for a service. Each AWS service defines its own set of category codes.

      

    
    :type communicationBody: string
    :param communicationBody: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The communication body text that describes the issue. This text appears in the **Description** field on the AWS Support Center `Create Case <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create>`__ page.

      

    
    :type ccEmailAddresses: list
    :param ccEmailAddresses: 

      A list of email addresses that AWS Support copies on case correspondence. AWS Support identifies the account that creates the case when you specify your AWS credentials in an HTTP POST method or use the `AWS SDKs <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/>`__ . 

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type language: string
    :param language: 

      The language in which AWS Support handles the case. You must specify the ISO 639-1 code for the ``language`` parameter if you want support in that language. Currently, English ("en") and Japanese ("ja") are supported.

      

    
    :type issueType: string
    :param issueType: 

      The type of issue for the case. You can specify ``customer-service`` or ``technical`` . If you don't specify a value, the default is ``technical`` .

      

    
    :type attachmentSetId: string
    :param attachmentSetId: 

      The ID of a set of one or more attachments for the case. Create the set by using the  AddAttachmentsToSet operation.

  .. py:method:: describe_communications(**kwargs)

    

    Returns communications and attachments for one or more support cases. Use the ``afterTime`` and ``beforeTime`` parameters to filter by date. You can use the ``caseId`` parameter to restrict the results to a specific case.

     

    Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was created more than 12 months ago, a request for data might cause an error.

     

    You can use the ``maxResults`` and ``nextToken`` parameters to control the pagination of the results. Set ``maxResults`` to the number of cases that you want to display on each page, and use ``nextToken`` to specify the resumption of pagination.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API.  
       
      * If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the ``SubscriptionRequiredException`` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see `AWS Support <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/>`__ .

The values in those fields don't necessarily match the service codes and categories returned by the ``DescribeServices`` operation. Always use the service codes and categories that the ``DescribeServices`` operation returns, so that you have the most recent set of service and category codes.
