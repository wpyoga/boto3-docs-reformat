.. py:class:: PI.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Performance Insights (PI)
   

  Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore different dimensions of database load based on data captured from a running DB instance. The guide provides detailed information about Performance Insights data types, parameters and errors.

   

  When Performance Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API provides visibility into the performance of your DB instance. Amazon CloudWatch provides the authoritative source for AWS service-vended monitoring metrics. Performance Insights offers a domain-specific view of DB load. 

   

  DB load is measured as Average Active Sessions. Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB load data for each time point in the queried time range. Each time point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: describe_dimension_keys(**kwargs)

    

    For a specific time period, retrieve the top ``N`` dimension keys for a metric.

     

    .. note::

       

      Each response element returns a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger elements, such as SQL statements, only the first 500 bytes are returned.

          NextToken='string'
      )
    :type ServiceType: string
    :param ServiceType: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The AWS service for which Performance Insights will return metrics. The only valid value for *ServiceType* is ``RDS`` .

      

    
    :type Identifier: string
    :param Identifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

      An immutable, AWS Region-unique identifier for a data source. Performance Insights gathers metrics from this data source.

       

      To use an Amazon RDS instance as a data source, you specify its ``DbiResourceId`` value. For example, specify ``db-FAIHNTYBKTGAUSUZQYPDS2GW4A``  

      

    
    :type StartTime: datetime
    :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The date and time specifying the beginning of the requested time series data. You must specify a ``StartTime`` within the past 7 days. The value specified is *inclusive* , which means that data points equal to or greater than ``StartTime`` are returned.

       

      The value for ``StartTime`` must be earlier than the value for ``EndTime`` .

      

    
    :type EndTime: datetime
    :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The date and time specifying the end of the requested time series data. The value specified is *exclusive* , which means that data points less than (but not equal to) ``EndTime`` are returned.

       

      The value for ``EndTime`` must be later than the value for ``StartTime`` .

      

    
    :type Metric: string
    :param Metric: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

       

      Valid values for ``Metric`` are:

       

       
      * ``db.load.avg`` - a scaled representation of the number of active sessions for the database engine. 
       
      * ``db.sampledload.avg`` - the raw number of active sessions for the database engine. 
       

       

      If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance Insights threshold, ``db.load.avg`` and ``db.sampledload.avg`` are the same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions, with ``db.load.avg`` showing the scaled values, ``db.sampledload.avg`` showing the raw values, and ``db.sampledload.avg`` less than ``db.load.avg`` . For most use cases, you can query ``db.load.avg`` only. 

      

    
    :type PeriodInSeconds: integer
    :param PeriodInSeconds: 

      The granularity, in seconds, of the data points returned from Performance Insights. A period can be as short as one second, or as long as one day (86400 seconds). Valid values are:

       

       
      * ``1`` (one second) 
       
      * ``60`` (one minute) 
       
      * ``300`` (five minutes) 
       
      * ``3600`` (one hour) 
       
      * ``86400`` (twenty-four hours) 
       

       

      If you don't specify ``PeriodInSeconds`` , then Performance Insights chooses a value for you, with a goal of returning roughly 100-200 data points in the response.

      

    
    :type GroupBy: dict
    :param GroupBy: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A specification for how to aggregate the data points from a query result. You must specify a valid dimension group. Performance Insights returns all dimensions within this group, unless you provide the names of specific dimensions within this group. You can also request that Performance Insights return a limited number of values for a dimension.

  .. py:method:: generate_presigned_url(ClientMethod, Params=None, ExpiresIn=3600, HttpMethod=None)

        
    Generate a presigned url given a client, its method, and arguments
    
    :type ClientMethod: string
    :param ClientMethod: The client method to presign for
    
    :type Params: dict
    :param Params: The parameters normally passed to
        ``ClientMethod``.
    
    :type ExpiresIn: int
    :param ExpiresIn: The number of seconds the presigned url is valid
        for. By default it expires in an hour (3600 seconds)
    
    :type HttpMethod: string
    :param HttpMethod: The http method to use on the generated url. By
        default, the http method is whatever is used in the method's model.
    
    :returns: The presigned url


  .. py:method:: get_dimension_key_details(**kwargs)

    

    Get the attributes of the specified dimension group for a DB instance or data source. For example, if you specify a SQL ID, ``GetDimensionKeyDetails`` retrieves the full text of the dimension ``db.sql.statement`` associated with this ID. This operation is useful because ``GetResourceMetrics`` and ``DescribeDimensionKeys`` don't support retrieval of large SQL statement text.

      The AWS service for which Performance Insights returns metrics. The only valid value for *ServiceType* is ``RDS`` .

      

    
    :type Identifier: string
    :param Identifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

      An immutable, AWS Region-unique identifier for a data source. Performance Insights gathers metrics from this data source.

       

      To use a DB instance as a data source, specify its ``DbiResourceId`` value. For example, specify ``db-FAIHNTYBKTGAUSUZQYPDS2GW4A`` .

      

    
    :type MetricQueries: list
    :param MetricQueries: **[REQUIRED]** 

      An array of one or more queries to perform. Each query must specify a Performance Insights metric, and can optionally specify aggregation and filtering criteria.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A single query to be processed. You must provide the metric to query. If no other parameters are specified, Performance Insights returns all of the data points for that metric. You can optionally request that the data points be aggregated by dimension group ( ``GroupBy`` ), and return only those data points that match your criteria (``Filter`` ).

        

      
        - **Metric** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

           

          Valid values for ``Metric`` are:

           

           
          * ``db.load.avg`` - a scaled representation of the number of active sessions for the database engine. 
           
          * ``db.sampledload.avg`` - the raw number of active sessions for the database engine. 
           

           

          If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance Insights threshold, ``db.load.avg`` and ``db.sampledload.avg`` are the same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions, with ``db.load.avg`` showing the scaled values, ``db.sampledload.avg`` showing the raw values, and ``db.sampledload.avg`` less than ``db.load.avg`` . For most use cases, you can query ``db.load.avg`` only. 

          

        
        - **GroupBy** *(dict) --* 

          A specification for how to aggregate the data points from a query result. You must specify a valid dimension group. Performance Insights will return all of the dimensions within that group, unless you provide the names of specific dimensions within that group. You can also request that Performance Insights return a limited number of values for a dimension.

          

        
          - **Group** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The name of the dimension group. Valid values are:

              - **Metric** *(string) --* 

                The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

                 

                Valid values for ``Metric`` are:

                 

                 
                * ``db.load.avg`` - a scaled representation of the number of active sessions for the database engine.
