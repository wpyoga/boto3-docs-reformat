.. py:class:: PinpointEmail.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon Pinpoint Email Service
   

  Welcome to the *Amazon Pinpoint Email API Reference* . This guide provides information about the Amazon Pinpoint Email API (version 1.0), including supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.

   

   `Amazon Pinpoint <https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint>`__ is an AWS service that you can use to engage with your customers across multiple messaging channels. You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send email, SMS text messages, voice messages, and push notifications. The Amazon Pinpoint Email API provides programmatic access to options that are unique to the email channel and supplement the options provided by the Amazon Pinpoint API.

   

  If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to also review the `Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html>`__ . The *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide* provides tutorials, code samples, and procedures that demonstrate how to use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically and how to integrate Amazon Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and other types of applications. The guide also provides information about key topics such as Amazon Pinpoint integration with other AWS services and the limits that apply to using the service.

   

  The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see `AWS Service Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* . To learn more about AWS Regions, see `Managing AWS Regions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

   

  In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see `AWS Global Infrastructure <http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/>`__ .

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: create_configuration_set(**kwargs)

    

    Create a configuration set. *Configuration sets* are groups of rules that you can apply to the emails you send using Amazon Pinpoint. You apply a configuration set to an email by including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email.

      - *(dict) --* 

        An object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

         

        Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value* , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

         

         
        * Tag keys and values are case sensitive. 
         
        * For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value. 
         
        * The ``aws:`` prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource. 
         
        * You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account. 
         

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don’t want a resource to have a specific tag value, don’t specify a value for this parameter. Amazon Pinpoint will set the value to an empty string.

  .. py:method:: create_configuration_set_event_destination(**kwargs)

    

    Create an event destination. In Amazon Pinpoint, *events* include message sends, deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints. *Event destinations* are places that you can send information about these events to. For example, you can send event data to Amazon SNS to receive notifications when you receive bounces or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

     

    A single configuration set can include more than one event destination.

      - *(dict) --* 

        An object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

         

        Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value* , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

         

         
        * Tag keys and values are case sensitive. 
         
        * For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value. 
         
        * The ``aws:`` prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource. 
         
        * You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account. 
         

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don’t want a resource to have a specific tag value, don’t specify a value for this parameter. Amazon Pinpoint will set the value to an empty string.

  .. py:method:: create_deliverability_test_report(**kwargs)

    

    Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox placement tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled by various email providers around the world. When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon Pinpoint then sends that message to special email addresses spread across several major email providers. After about 24 hours, the test is complete, and you can use the ``GetDeliverabilityTestReport`` operation to view the results of the test.

  .. py:method:: create_email_identity(**kwargs)

    

    Verifies an email identity for use with Amazon Pinpoint. In Amazon Pinpoint, an identity is an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use an identity to send email with Amazon Pinpoint, you first have to verify it. By verifying an address, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the address, and that you've given Amazon Pinpoint permission to send email from the address.

     

    When you verify an email address, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email. 

     

    When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. It usually takes around 72 hours to complete the domain verification process.

            If the value is ``true`` , then the messages that Amazon Pinpoint sends from the identity are DKIM-signed. If the value is ``false`` , then the messages that Amazon Pinpoint sends from the identity aren't DKIM-signed.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            Describes whether or not Amazon Pinpoint has successfully located the DKIM records in the DNS records for the domain. The status can be one of the following:

             

             
            * ``PENDING`` – Amazon Pinpoint hasn't yet located the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain, but will continue to attempt to locate them. 
             
            * ``SUCCESS`` – Amazon Pinpoint located the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain and determined that they're correct. Amazon Pinpoint can now send DKIM-signed email from the identity. 
             
            * ``FAILED`` – Amazon Pinpoint was unable to locate the DKIM records in the DNS settings for the domain, and won't continue to search for them. 
             
            * ``TEMPORARY_FAILURE`` – A temporary issue occurred, which prevented Amazon Pinpoint from determining the DKIM status for the domain. 
             
            * ``NOT_STARTED`` – Amazon Pinpoint hasn't yet started searching for the DKIM records in the DKIM records for the domain. 
             

            
          

          - **Tokens** *(list) --* 

            A set of unique strings that you use to create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS configuration for your domain. When Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain, the DKIM authentication process is complete. Amazon Pinpoint usually detects these records within about 72 hours of adding them to the DNS configuration for your domain.

          - **SendingEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

            If ``true`` , email sending is enabled for the configuration set. If ``false`` , email sending is disabled for the configuration set.

            
      
        

        - **Tags** *(list) --* 

          An array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that are associated with the configuration set.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            An object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

             

            Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value* , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

             

             
            * Tag keys and values are case sensitive. 
             
            * For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value. 
             
            * The ``aws:`` prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource. 
             
            * You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account. 
             

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don’t want a resource to have a specific tag value, don’t specify a value for this parameter. Amazon Pinpoint will set the value to an empty string.

          - *(dict) --* 

            An object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

             

            Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value* , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

             

             
            * Tag keys and values are case sensitive. 
             
            * For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value. 
             
            * The ``aws:`` prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource. 
             
            * You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account. 
             

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don’t want a resource to have a specific tag value, don’t specify a value for this parameter. Amazon Pinpoint will set the value to an empty string.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        Details about an email identity.

        
        

        - **IdentityType** *(string) --* 

          The email identity type.

          
        

        - **FeedbackForwardingStatus** *(boolean) --* 

          The feedback forwarding configuration for the identity.

           

          If the value is ``true`` , Amazon Pinpoint sends you email notifications when bounce or complaint events occur. Amazon Pinpoint sends this notification to the address that you specified in the Return-Path header of the original email.

           

          When you set this value to ``false`` , Amazon Pinpoint sends notifications through other mechanisms, such as by notifying an Amazon SNS topic or another event destination. You're required to have a method of tracking bounces and complaints. If you haven't set up another mechanism for receiving bounce or complaint notifications, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email notification when these events occur (even if this setting is disabled).

          
        

        - **VerifiedForSendingStatus** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether or not the identity is verified. In Amazon Pinpoint, you can only send email from verified email addresses or domains. For more information about verifying identities, see the `Amazon Pinpoint User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/channels-email-manage-verify.html>`__ .

          
        

        - **DkimAttributes** *(dict) --* 

          An object that contains information about the DKIM attributes for the identity. This object includes the tokens that you use to create the CNAME records that are required to complete the DKIM verification process.

          
          

          - **SigningEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

            If the value is ``true`` , then the messages that Amazon Pinpoint sends from the identity are DKIM-signed. If the value is ``false`` , then the messages that Amazon Pinpoint sends from the identity aren't DKIM-signed.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            Describes whether or not Amazon Pinpoint has successfully located the DKIM records in the DNS records for the domain. The status can be one of the following:

             

             
            * ``PENDING`` – Amazon Pinpoint hasn't yet located the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain, but will continue to attempt to locate them. 
             
            * ``SUCCESS`` – Amazon Pinpoint located the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain and determined that they're correct. Amazon Pinpoint can now send DKIM-signed email from the identity. 
             
            * ``FAILED`` – Amazon Pinpoint was unable to locate the DKIM records in the DNS settings for the domain, and won't continue to search for them. 
             
            * ``TEMPORARY_FAILURE`` – A temporary issue occurred, which prevented Amazon Pinpoint from determining the DKIM status for the domain. 
             
            * ``NOT_STARTED`` – Amazon Pinpoint hasn't yet started searching for the DKIM records in the DKIM records for the domain. 
             

            
          

          - **Tokens** *(list) --* 

            A set of unique strings that you use to create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS configuration for your domain. When Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain, the DKIM authentication process is complete. Amazon Pinpoint usually detects these records within about 72 hours of adding them to the DNS configuration for your domain.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
      
        

        - **MailFromAttributes** *(dict) --* 

          An object that contains information about the Mail-From attributes for the email identity.

          
          

          - **MailFromDomain** *(string) --* 

            The name of a domain that an email identity uses as a custom MAIL FROM domain.

            
          

          - **MailFromDomainStatus** *(string) --* 

            The status of the MAIL FROM domain. This status can have the following values:

             

             
            * ``PENDING`` – Amazon Pinpoint hasn't started searching for the MX record yet. 
             
            * ``SUCCESS`` – Amazon Pinpoint detected the required MX record for the MAIL FROM domain. 
             
            * ``FAILED`` – Amazon Pinpoint can't find the required MX record, or the record no longer exists. 
             
            * ``TEMPORARY_FAILURE`` – A temporary issue occurred, which prevented Amazon Pinpoint from determining the status of the MAIL FROM domain. 
             

            
          

          - **BehaviorOnMxFailure** *(string) --* 

            The action that Amazon Pinpoint to takes if it can't read the required MX record for a custom MAIL FROM domain. When you set this value to ``UseDefaultValue`` , Amazon Pinpoint uses *amazonses.com* as the MAIL FROM domain. When you set this value to ``RejectMessage`` , Amazon Pinpoint returns a ``MailFromDomainNotVerified`` error, and doesn't attempt to deliver the email.

             

            These behaviors are taken when the custom MAIL FROM domain configuration is in the ``Pending`` , ``Failed`` , and ``TemporaryFailure`` states.

            
      
        

        - **Tags** *(list) --* 

          An array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that are associated with the email identity.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            An object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

             

            Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value* , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

             

             
            * Tag keys and values are case sensitive. 
             
            * For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value. 
             
            * The ``aws:`` prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource. 
             
            * You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account. 
             

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don’t want a resource to have a specific tag value, don’t specify a value for this parameter. Amazon Pinpoint will set the value to an empty string.

          - *(dict) --* 

            An object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

             

            Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value* , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

             

             
            * Tag keys and values are case sensitive. 
             
            * For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value. 
             
            * The ``aws:`` prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource. 
             
            * You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account. 
             

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don’t want a resource to have a specific tag value, don’t specify a value for this parameter. Amazon Pinpoint will set the value to an empty string.

  .. py:method:: put_deliverability_dashboard_option(**kwargs)

    

    Enable or disable the Deliverability dashboard for your Amazon Pinpoint account. When you enable the Deliverability dashboard, you gain access to reputation, deliverability, and other metrics for the domains that you use to send email using Amazon Pinpoint. You also gain the ability to perform predictive inbox placement tests.

     

    When you use the Deliverability dashboard, you pay a monthly subscription charge, in addition to any other fees that you accrue by using Amazon Pinpoint. For more information about the features and cost of a Deliverability dashboard subscription, see `Amazon Pinpoint Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/pricing/>`__ .

  .. py:method:: put_email_identity_feedback_attributes(**kwargs)

    

    Used to enable or disable feedback forwarding for an identity. This setting determines what happens when an identity is used to send an email that results in a bounce or complaint event.

     

    When you enable feedback forwarding, Amazon Pinpoint sends you email notifications when bounce or complaint events occur. Amazon Pinpoint sends this notification to the address that you specified in the Return-Path header of the original email.

     

    When you disable feedback forwarding, Amazon Pinpoint sends notifications through other mechanisms, such as by notifying an Amazon SNS topic. You're required to have a method of tracking bounces and complaints. If you haven't set up another mechanism for receiving bounce or complaint notifications, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email notification when these events occur (even if this setting is disabled).

    Sends an email message. You can use the Amazon Pinpoint Email API to send two types of messages:

     

     
    * **Simple** – A standard email message. When you create this type of message, you specify the sender, the recipient, and the message body, and Amazon Pinpoint assembles the message for you. 
     
    * **Raw** – A raw, MIME-formatted email message. When you send this type of email, you have to specify all of the message headers, as well as the message body. You can use this message type to send messages that contain attachments. The message that you specify has to be a valid MIME message.

  .. py:method:: tag_resource(**kwargs)

    

    Add one or more tags (keys and values) to a specified resource. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

     

    Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value* , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for more specific tag values. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key.
