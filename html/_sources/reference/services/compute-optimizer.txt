.. py:class:: ComputeOptimizer.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Compute Optimizer
  

  AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization metrics of your AWS compute resources, such as EC2 instances, Auto Scaling groups, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon EBS volumes. It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also provides recent utilization metric data, as well as projected utilization metric data for the recommendations, which you can use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best price-performance trade-off. The analysis of your usage patterns can help you decide when to move or resize your running resources, and still meet your performance and capacity requirements. For more information about Compute Optimizer, including the required permissions to use the service, see the `AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/>`__ .

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: describe_recommendation_export_jobs(**kwargs)

    

    Describes recommendation export jobs created in the last seven days.

     

    Use the ``ExportAutoScalingGroupRecommendations`` or ``ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations`` actions to request an export of your recommendations. Then use the ``DescribeRecommendationExportJobs`` action to view your export jobs.

After you create the S3 bucket, ensure that it has the required permission policy to allow Compute Optimizer to write the export file to it. If you plan to specify an object prefix when you create the export job, you must include the object prefix in the policy that you add to the S3 bucket. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Bucket Policy for Compute Optimizer <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/create-s3-bucket-policy-for-compute-optimizer.html>`__ in the *Compute Optimizer user guide* .

  .. py:method:: export_lambda_function_recommendations(**kwargs)

    

    Exports optimization recommendations for AWS Lambda functions.

     

    Recommendations are exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file, and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (.json) file, to an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you specify. For more information, see `Exporting Recommendations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/exporting-recommendations.html>`__ in the *Compute Optimizer User Guide* .

     

    You can have only one Lambda function export job in progress per AWS Region.

                    - **statistic** *(string) --* 

                      The statistic of the utilization metric.

                       

                      The Compute Optimizer API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and SDKs return utilization metrics using only the ``Maximum`` statistic, which is the highest value observed during the specified period.

                       

                      The Compute Optimizer console displays graphs for some utilization metrics using the ``Average`` statistic, which is the value of ``Sum`` / ``SampleCount`` during the specified period. For more information, see `Viewing resource recommendations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/viewing-recommendations.html>`__ in the *AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide* . You can also get averaged utilization metric data for your resources using Amazon CloudWatch. For more information, see the `Amazon CloudWatch User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html>`__ .

                      
                    

                    - **value** *(float) --* 

                      The value of the utilization metric.

                      
                
              
                

                - **performanceRisk** *(float) --* 

                  The performance risk of the Auto Scaling group configuration recommendation.

                   

                  Performance risk indicates the likelihood of the recommended instance type not meeting the resource needs of your workload. Compute Optimizer calculates an individual performance risk score for each specification of the recommended instance, including CPU, memory, EBS throughput, EBS IOPS, disk throughput, disk IOPS, network throughput, and network PPS. The performance risk of the recommended instance is calculated as the maximum performance risk score across the analyzed resource specifications.

                   

                  The value ranges from ``0`` - ``4`` , with ``0`` meaning that the recommended resource is predicted to always provide enough hardware capability. The higher the performance risk is, the more likely you should validate whether the recommendation will meet the performance requirements of your workload before migrating your resource.

                  
                

                - **rank** *(integer) --*

        - **errors** *(list) --* 

          An array of objects that describe errors of the request.

           

          For example, an error is returned if you request recommendations for an unsupported Auto Scaling group.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Describes an error experienced when getting recommendations.

             

            For example, an error is returned if you request recommendations for an unsupported Auto Scaling group, or if you request recommendations for an instance of an unsupported instance family.

            
            

            - **identifier** *(string) --* 

              The ID of the error.

                  Performance risk is the likelihood of the recommended volume type meeting the performance requirement of your workload.

                   

                  The value ranges from ``0`` - ``4`` , with ``0`` meaning that the recommended resource is predicted to always provide enough hardware capability. The higher the performance risk is, the more likely you should validate whether the recommendation will meet the performance requirements of your workload before migrating your resource.

                  
                

                - **rank** *(integer) --*

              * **``CPUOverprovisioned`` ** — The instance’s CPU configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the ``CPUUtilization`` metric of the current instance during the look-back period. 
               
              * **``CPUUnderprovisioned`` ** — The instance’s CPU configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better CPU performance. This is identified by analyzing the ``CPUUtilization`` metric of the current instance during the look-back period. 
               
              * **``MemoryOverprovisioned`` ** — The instance’s memory configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the memory utilization metric of the current instance during the look-back period. 
               
              * **``MemoryUnderprovisioned`` ** — The instance’s memory configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better memory performance. This is identified by analyzing the memory utilization metric of the current instance during the look-back period. 

              .. note::

                 Memory utilization is analyzed only for resources that have the unified CloudWatch agent installed on them. For more information, see `Enabling memory utilization with the Amazon CloudWatch Agent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/metrics.html#cw-agent>`__ in the *AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide* . On Linux instances, Compute Optimizer analyses the ``mem_used_percent`` metric in the ``CWAgent`` namespace, or the legacy ``MemoryUtilization`` metric in the ``System/Linux`` namespace. On Windows instances, Compute Optimizer analyses the ``Memory % Committed Bytes In Use`` metric in the ``CWAgent`` namespace. 

               
               
              * **``EBSThroughputOverprovisioned`` ** — The instance’s EBS throughput configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload.

                  Describes the configuration differences between the current instance and the recommended instance type. You should consider the configuration differences before migrating your workloads from the current instance to the recommended instance type. The `Change the instance type guide for Linux <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html>`__ and `Change the instance type guide for Windows <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html>`__ provide general guidance for getting started with an instance migration.

                   

                  Platform differences include:

                   

                   
                  * **``Hypervisor`` ** — The hypervisor of the recommended instance type is different than that of the current instance. For example, the recommended instance type uses a Nitro hypervisor and the current instance uses a Xen hypervisor. The differences that you should consider between these hypervisors are covered in the `Nitro Hypervisor <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#Nitro_Hypervisor>`__ section of the Amazon EC2 frequently asked questions. For more information, see `Instances built on the Nitro System <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux* , or `Instances built on the Nitro System <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows* . 
                   
                  * **``NetworkInterface`` ** — The network interface of the recommended instance type is different than that of the current instance. For example, the recommended instance type supports enhanced networking and the current instance might not. To enable enhanced networking for the recommended instance type, you will need to install the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) driver or the Intel 82599 Virtual Function driver. For more information, see `Networking and storage features <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#instance-networking-storage>`__ and `Enhanced networking on Linux <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux* , or `Networking and storage features <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/instance-types.html#instance-networking-storage>`__ and `Enhanced networking on Windows <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/enhanced-networking.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows* . 
                   
                  * **``StorageInterface`` ** — The storage interface of the recommended instance type is different than that of the current instance. For example, the recommended instance type uses an NVMe storage interface and the current instance does not. To access NVMe volumes for the recommended instance type, you will need to install or upgrade the NVMe driver. For more information, see `Networking and storage features <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#instance-networking-storage>`__ and `Amazon EBS and NVMe on Linux instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/nvme-ebs-volumes.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux* , or `Networking and storage features <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/instance-types.html#instance-networking-storage>`__ and `Amazon EBS and NVMe on Windows instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/nvme-ebs-volumes.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows* . 
                   
                  * **``InstanceStoreAvailability`` ** — The recommended instance type does not support instance store volumes and the current instance does. Before migrating, you might need to back up the data on your instance store volumes if you want to preserve them. For more information, see `How do I back up an instance store volume on my Amazon EC2 instance to Amazon EBS? <https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/back-up-instance-store-ebs/>`__ in the *AWS Premium Support Knowledge Base* . For more information, see `Networking and storage features <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#instance-networking-storage>`__ and `Amazon EC2 instance store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux* , or see `Networking and storage features <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/instance-types.html#instance-networking-storage>`__ and `Amazon EC2 instance store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/InstanceStorage.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows* . 
                   
                  * **``VirtualizationType`` ** — The recommended instance type uses the hardware virtual machine (HVM) virtualization type and the current instance uses the paravirtual (PV) virtualization type. For more information about the differences between these virtualization types, see `Linux AMI virtualization types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/virtualization_types.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux* , or `Windows AMI virtualization types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/windows-ami-version-history.html#virtualization-types>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows* .

                - **performanceRisk** *(float) --* 

                  The performance risk of the instance recommendation option.

                   

                  Performance risk indicates the likelihood of the recommended instance type not meeting the resource needs of your workload. Compute Optimizer calculates an individual performance risk score for each specification of the recommended instance, including CPU, memory, EBS throughput, EBS IOPS, disk throughput, disk IOPS, network throughput, and network PPS. The performance risk of the recommended instance is calculated as the maximum performance risk score across the analyzed resource specifications.

                   

                  The value ranges from ``0`` - ``4`` , with ``0`` meaning that the recommended resource is predicted to always provide enough hardware capability. The higher the performance risk is, the more likely you should validate whether the recommendation will meet the performance requirements of your workload before migrating your resource.

                - **statistic** *(string) --* 

                  The statistic of the utilization metric.

                   

                  The Compute Optimizer API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and SDKs return utilization metrics using only the ``Maximum`` statistic, which is the highest value observed during the specified period.

                   

                  The Compute Optimizer console displays graphs for some utilization metrics using the ``Average`` statistic, which is the value of ``Sum`` / ``SampleCount`` during the specified period. For more information, see `Viewing resource recommendations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/viewing-recommendations.html>`__ in the *AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide* . You can also get averaged utilization metric data for your resources using Amazon CloudWatch. For more information, see the `Amazon CloudWatch User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html>`__ .

              The time stamp of when the function recommendation was last refreshed.

              
            

            - **finding** *(string) --* 

              The finding classification of the function.

               

              Findings for functions include:

               

               
              * **``Optimized`` ** — The function is correctly provisioned to run your workload based on its current configuration and its utilization history. This finding classification does not include finding reason codes. 
               
              * **``NotOptimized`` ** — The function is performing at a higher level (over-provisioned) or at a lower level (under-provisioned) than required for your workload because its current configuration is not optimal. Over-provisioned resources might lead to unnecessary infrastructure cost, and under-provisioned resources might lead to poor application performance. This finding classification can include the ``MemoryUnderprovisioned`` and ``MemoryUnderprovisioned`` finding reason codes. 
               
              * **``Unavailable`` ** — Compute Optimizer was unable to generate a recommendation for the function. This could be because the function has not accumulated sufficient metric data, or the function does not qualify for a recommendation. This finding classification can include the ``InsufficientData`` and ``Inconclusive`` finding reason codes. 

              .. note::

                 Functions with a finding of unavailable are not returned unless you specify the ``filter`` parameter with a value of ``Unavailable`` in your ``GetLambdaFunctionRecommendations`` request. 

               
               

              
            

            - **findingReasonCodes** *(list) --* 

              The reason for the finding classification of the function.

               

              .. note::

                 

                Functions that have a finding classification of ``Optimized`` don't have a finding reason code.

                 

               

              Finding reason codes for functions include:

               

               
              * **``MemoryOverprovisioned`` ** — The function is over-provisioned when its memory configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. An over-provisioned function might lead to unnecessary infrastructure cost. This finding reason code is part of the ``NotOptimized`` finding classification. 
               
              * **``MemoryUnderprovisioned`` ** — The function is under-provisioned when its memory configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of the workload. An under-provisioned function might lead to poor application performance. This finding reason code is part of the ``NotOptimized`` finding classification. 
               
              * **``InsufficientData`` ** — The function does not have sufficient metric data for Compute Optimizer to generate a recommendation. For more information, see the `Supported resources and requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/requirements.html>`__ in the *AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide* . This finding reason code is part of the ``Unavailable`` finding classification. 
               
              * **``Inconclusive`` ** — The function does not qualify for a recommendation because Compute Optimizer cannot generate a recommendation with a high degree of confidence. This finding reason code is part of the ``Unavailable`` finding classification.

  .. py:method:: update_enrollment_status(**kwargs)

    

    Updates the enrollment (opt in and opt out) status of an account to the AWS Compute Optimizer service.

     

    If the account is a management account of an organization, this action can also be used to enroll member accounts within the organization.

     

    You must have the appropriate permissions to opt in to Compute Optimizer, to view its recommendations, and to opt out. For more information, see `Controlling access with AWS Identity and Access Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/security-iam.html>`__ in the *AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide* .

     

    When you opt in, Compute Optimizer automatically creates a Service-Linked Role in your account to access its data. For more information, see `Using Service-Linked Roles for AWS Compute Optimizer <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/using-service-linked-roles.html>`__ in the *AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide* .

    

    See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/compute-optimizer-2019-11-01/UpdateEnrollmentStatus>`_    


    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.update_enrollment_status(
          status='Active'|'Inactive'|'Pending'|'Failed',
          includeMemberAccounts=True|False
      )
    :type status: string
    :param status: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The new enrollment status of the account.

       

      The following status options are available:

       

       
      * ``Active`` - Opts in your account to the Compute Optimizer service. Compute Optimizer begins analyzing the configuration and utilization metrics of your AWS resources after you opt in. For more information, see `Metrics analyzed by AWS Compute Optimizer <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/metrics.html>`__ in the *AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide* . 
       
      * ``Inactive`` - Opts out your account from the Compute Optimizer service. Your account's recommendations and related metrics data will be deleted from Compute Optimizer after you opt out. 
       

       

      .. note::

         

        The ``Pending`` and ``Failed`` options cannot be used to update the enrollment status of an account. They are returned in the response of a request to update the enrollment status of an account.

         

      

    
    :type includeMemberAccounts: boolean
    :param includeMemberAccounts: 

      Indicates whether to enroll member accounts of the organization if the account is the management account of an organization.

      **Response Syntax** 

      
      ::

        {
            'status': 'Active'|'Inactive'|'Pending'|'Failed',
            'statusReason': 'string'
        }
      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **status** *(string) --* 

          The enrollment status of the account.

          
        

        - **statusReason** *(string) --* 

          The reason for the enrollment status of the account. For example, an account might show a status of ``Pending`` because member accounts of an organization require more time to be enrolled in the service.
