.. py:class:: KMS.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
   

  AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the ` *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/`__ .

   

  .. note::

     

    AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see `Tools for Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/>`__ .

     

   

  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS.

   

  Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.

   

   **Signing Requests**  

   

  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you *do not* use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests.

   

  All AWS KMS operations require `Signature Version 4 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__ .

   

   **Logging API Requests**  

   

  AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the `AWS CloudTrail User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/>`__ .

   

   **Additional Resources**  

   

  For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:

   

   
  * `AWS Security Credentials <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html>`__ - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used for accessing AWS. 
   
  * `Temporary Security Credentials <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html>`__ - This section of the *IAM User Guide* describes how to create and use temporary security credentials. 
   
  * `Signature Version 4 Signing Process <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__ - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key. 
   

   

   **Commonly Used API Operations**

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: cancel_key_deletion(**kwargs)

    

    Cancels the deletion of a customer master key (CMK). When this operation succeeds, the key state of the CMK is ``Disabled`` . To enable the CMK, use  EnableKey . 

     

    For more information about scheduling and canceling deletion of a CMK, see `Deleting Customer Master Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account.

     

     **Required permissions** : `kms\:CancelKeyDeletion <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ (key policy)

     

     **Related operations** :  ScheduleKeyDeletion  

    

    See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/kms-2014-11-01/CancelKeyDeletion>`_    


    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.cancel_key_deletion(
          KeyId='string'
      )
    :type KeyId: string
    :param KeyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Identifies the customer master key (CMK) whose deletion is being canceled.

       

      Specify the key ID or key ARN of the CMK.

       

      For example:

       

       
      * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
       
      * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
       

       

      To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey .

      

    
    
    :rtype: dict
    :returns: 
      
      **Response Syntax** 

      
      ::

        {
            'KeyId': 'string'
        }
      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **KeyId** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (`key ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-ARN>`__ ) of the CMK whose deletion is canceled.

          
    
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`KMS.Client.exceptions.NotFoundException`

    
    *     :py:class:`KMS.Client.exceptions.InvalidArnException`

    
    *     :py:class:`KMS.Client.exceptions.DependencyTimeoutException`

    
    *     :py:class:`KMS.Client.exceptions.KMSInternalException`

    
    *     :py:class:`KMS.Client.exceptions.KMSInvalidStateException`

    

    **Examples** 

    The following example cancels deletion of the specified CMK.
    ::

      response = client.cancel_key_deletion(
          # The identifier of the CMK whose deletion you are canceling. You can use the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK.
          KeyId='1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab',
      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

      {
          # The ARN of the CMK whose deletion you canceled.
          'KeyId': 'arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab',
          'ResponseMetadata': {
              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: connect_custom_key_store(**kwargs)

    

    Connects or reconnects a `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.

     

    The custom key store must be connected before you can create customer master keys (CMKs) in the key store or use the CMKs it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time.

     

    To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the `DescribeClusters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html>`__ operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the `CreateHsm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm.html>`__ operation. Also, the ` ``kmsuser`` crypto user <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser>`__ (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from using this account to log in.

     

    The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

     

    During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the ``kmsuser`` CU, and rotates its password.

     

    The ``ConnectCustomKeyStore`` operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the ``ConnectionErrorCode`` in the response. For help interpreting the ``ConnectionErrorCode`` , see  CustomKeyStoresListEntry .

     

    To fix the failure, use the  DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the  UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use ``ConnectCustomKeyStore`` again.

     

    If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see `Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different AWS account.

     

     **Required permissions** : `kms\:ConnectCustomKeyStore <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ (IAM policy)

     

     **Related operations**  

     

     
    *  CreateCustomKeyStore   
     
    *  DeleteCustomKeyStore   
     
    *  DescribeCustomKeyStores   
     
    *  DisconnectCustomKeyStore   
     
    *  UpdateCustomKeyStore   
     

    

    See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/kms-2014-11-01/ConnectCustomKeyStore>`_

          CustomKeyStoreId='string'
      )
    :type CustomKeyStoreId: string
    :param CustomKeyStoreId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Enter the key store ID of the custom key store that you want to connect. To find the ID of a custom key store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

  .. py:method:: create_alias(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a friendly name for a customer master key (CMK). 

     

    .. note::

       

      Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the CMK. For details, see `Using ABAC in AWS KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

       

     

    You can use an alias to identify a CMK in the AWS KMS console, in the  DescribeKey operation and in `cryptographic operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ , such as  Encrypt and  GenerateDataKey . You can also change the CMK that's associated with the alias ( UpdateAlias ) or delete the alias ( DeleteAlias ) at any time. These operations don't affect the underlying CMK. 

     

    You can associate the alias with any customer managed CMK in the same AWS Region. Each alias is associated with only one CMK at a time, but a CMK can have multiple aliases. A valid CMK is required. You can't create an alias without a CMK.

     

    The alias must be unique in the account and Region, but you can have aliases with the same name in different Regions. For detailed information about aliases, see `Using aliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    This operation does not return a response. To get the alias that you created, use the  ListAliases operation.

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account.

     

     **Required permissions**  

     

     
    * `kms\:CreateAlias <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ on the alias (IAM policy). 
     
    * `kms\:CreateAlias <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ on the CMK (key policy). 
     

     

    For details, see `Controlling access to aliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html#alias-access>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

          AliasName='string',
          TargetKeyId='string'
      )
    :type AliasName: string
    :param AliasName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the alias name. This value must begin with ``alias/`` followed by a name, such as ``alias/ExampleAlias`` . 

       

      The ``AliasName`` value must be string of 1-256 characters. It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with ``alias/aws/`` . The ``alias/aws/`` prefix is reserved for `AWS managed CMKs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk>`__ .

      

    
    :type TargetKeyId: string
    :param TargetKeyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Associates the alias with the specified `customer managed CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk>`__ . The CMK must be in the same AWS Region. 

       

      A valid CMK ID is required. If you supply a null or empty string value, this operation returns an error.

       

      For help finding the key ID and ARN, see `Finding the Key ID and ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/viewing-keys.html#find-cmk-id-arn>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

       

      Specify the key ID or key ARN of the CMK.

       

      For example:

       

       
      * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``

    *     :py:class:`KMS.Client.exceptions.KMSInvalidStateException`

    

    **Examples** 

    The following example creates an alias for the specified customer master key (CMK).
    ::

      response = client.create_alias(
          # The alias to create. Aliases must begin with 'alias/'. Do not use aliases that begin with 'alias/aws' because they are reserved for use by AWS.
          AliasName='alias/ExampleAlias',
          # The identifier of the CMK whose alias you are creating. You can use the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK.
          TargetKeyId='1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab',
      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

      {
          'ResponseMetadata': {
              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: create_custom_key_store(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ that is associated with an `AWS CloudHSM cluster <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/clusters.html>`__ that you own and manage.

     

    This operation is part of the `Custom Key Store feature <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

     

    Before you create the custom key store, you must assemble the required elements, including an AWS CloudHSM cluster that fulfills the requirements for a custom key store. For details about the required elements, see `Assemble the Prerequisites <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keystore.html#before-keystore>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the new custom key store. Before you can use your new custom key store, you need to use the  ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect the new key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster. Even if you are not going to use your custom key store immediately, you might want to connect it to verify that all settings are correct and then disconnect it until you are ready to use it.

     

    For help with failures, see `Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different AWS account.

     

     **Required permissions** : `kms\:CreateCustomKeyStore <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ (IAM policy).

  .. py:method:: create_grant(**kwargs)

    

    Adds a grant to a customer master key (CMK). 

     

    A *grant* is a policy instrument that allows AWS principals to use AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) in cryptographic operations. It also can allow them to view a CMK ( DescribeKey ) and create and manage grants. When authorizing access to a CMK, grants are considered along with key policies and IAM policies. Grants are often used for temporary permissions because you can create one, use its permissions, and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies. 

     

    For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see `Using grants <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html>`__ in the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* * . For examples of working with grants in several programming languages, see `Programming grants <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/programming-grants.html>`__ .

     

    The ``CreateGrant`` operation returns a ``GrantToken`` and a ``GrantId`` .

     

     
    * When you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief delay, usually less than five minutes, until the grant is available throughout AWS KMS. This state is known as *eventual consistency* . Once the grant has achieved eventual consistency, the grantee principal can use the permissions in the grant without identifying the grant.  However, to use the permissions in the grant immediately, use the ``GrantToken`` that ``CreateGrant`` returns. For details, see `Using a grant token <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/using-grant-token.html>`__ in the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* * . 
     
    * The ``CreateGrant`` operation also returns a ``GrantId`` . You can use the ``GrantId`` and a key identifier to identify the grant in the  RetireGrant and  RevokeGrant operations. To find the grant ID, use the  ListGrants or  ListRetirableGrants operations. 
     

     

    For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see `Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . For more information about grants, see `Grants <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html>`__ in the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* * .

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : Yes. To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN in the value of the ``KeyId`` parameter.

      Identifies the customer master key (CMK) for the grant. The grant gives principals permission to use this CMK.

       

      Specify the key ID or key ARN of the CMK. To specify a CMK in a different AWS account, you must use the key ARN.

       

      For example:

       

       
      * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``

    :type GranteePrincipal: string
    :param GranteePrincipal: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The identity that gets the permissions specified in the grant.

       

      To specify the principal, use the `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of an AWS principal. Valid AWS principals include AWS accounts (root), IAM users, IAM roles, federated users, and assumed role users. For examples of the ARN syntax to use for specifying a principal, see `AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-iam>`__ in the Example ARNs section of the *AWS General Reference* .

      

    
    :type RetiringPrincipal: string
    :param RetiringPrincipal: 

      The principal that is given permission to retire the grant by using  RetireGrant operation.

       

      To specify the principal, use the `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of an AWS principal. Valid AWS principals include AWS accounts (root), IAM users, federated users, and assumed role users.

    :type Operations: list
    :param Operations: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A list of operations that the grant permits. 

       

      The operation must be supported on the CMK. For example, you cannot create a grant for a symmetric CMK that allows the  Sign operation, or a grant for an asymmetric CMK that allows the  GenerateDataKey operation. If you try, AWS KMS returns a ``ValidationError`` exception. For details, see `Grant operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html#terms-grant-operations>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Constraints: dict
    :param Constraints: 

      Specifies a grant constraint. 

       

      AWS KMS supports the ``EncryptionContextEquals`` and ``EncryptionContextSubset`` grant constraints. Each constraint value can include up to 8 encryption context pairs. The encryption context value in each constraint cannot exceed 384 characters.

       

      These grant constraints allow a `cryptographic operation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ only when the encryption context in the request matches (``EncryptionContextEquals`` ) or includes (``EncryptionContextSubset`` ) the encryption context specified in this structure. For more information about encryption context, see `Encryption Context <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context>`__ in the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* * . For information about grant constraints, see `Using grant constraints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-grant-overview.html#grant-constraints>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

       

      The encryption context grant constraints are supported only on operations that include an encryption context. You cannot use an encryption context grant constraint for cryptographic operations with asymmetric CMKs or for management operations, such as  DescribeKey or  RetireGrant .

      

    
      - **EncryptionContextSubset** *(dict) --* 

        A list of key-value pairs that must be included in the encryption context of the `cryptographic operation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ request. The grant allows the cryptographic operation only when the encryption context in the request includes the key-value pairs specified in this constraint, although it can include additional key-value pairs.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
          - *(string) --*

        A list of key-value pairs that must match the encryption context in the `cryptographic operation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ request. The grant allows the operation only when the encryption context in the request is the same as the encryption context specified in this constraint.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
    
  
    
    :type GrantTokens: list
    :param GrantTokens: 

      A list of grant tokens. 

       

      Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes from a new grant that has not yet achieved *eventual consistency* . For more information, see `Grant token <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#grant_token>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Name: string
    :param Name: 

      A friendly name for the grant. Use this value to prevent the unintended creation of duplicate grants when retrying this request.

       

      When this value is absent, all ``CreateGrant`` requests result in a new grant with a unique ``GrantId`` even if all the supplied parameters are identical. This can result in unintended duplicates when you retry the ``CreateGrant`` request.

       

      When this value is present, you can retry a ``CreateGrant`` request with identical parameters; if the grant already exists, the original ``GrantId`` is returned without creating a new grant. Note that the returned grant token is unique with every ``CreateGrant`` request, even when a duplicate ``GrantId`` is returned. All grant tokens for the same grant ID can be used interchangeably.

  .. py:method:: create_key(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a unique customer managed `customer master key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master-keys>`__ (CMK) in your AWS account and Region.

     

    You can use the ``CreateKey`` operation to create symmetric or asymmetric CMKs.

     

     
    * **Symmetric CMKs** contain a 256-bit symmetric key that never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. To use the CMK, you must call AWS KMS. You can use a symmetric CMK to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they are typically used to generate `data keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys>`__ and `data keys pairs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-key-pairs>`__ . For details, see  GenerateDataKey and  GenerateDataKeyPair . 
     
    * **Asymmetric CMKs** can contain an RSA key pair or an Elliptic Curve (ECC) key pair. The private key in an asymmetric CMK never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the  GetPublicKey operation to download the public key so it can be used outside of AWS KMS. CMKs with RSA key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but not both). CMKs with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and verify messages. 
     

     

    For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see `Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    To create different types of CMKs, use the following guidance:

      Asymmetric CMKs  

    To create an asymmetric CMK, use the ``CustomerMasterKeySpec`` parameter to specify the type of key material in the CMK. Then, use the ``KeyUsage`` parameter to determine whether the CMK will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change these properties after the CMK is created.

     

     

      Symmetric CMKs  

    When creating a symmetric CMK, you don't need to specify the ``CustomerMasterKeySpec`` or ``KeyUsage`` parameters. The default value for ``CustomerMasterKeySpec`` , ``SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`` , and the default value for ``KeyUsage`` , ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`` , are the only valid values for symmetric CMKs. 

     

     

      Multi-Region primary keys Imported key material  

    To create a multi-Region *primary key* in the local AWS Region, use the ``MultiRegion`` parameter with a value of ``True`` . To create a multi-Region *replica key* , that is, a CMK with the same key ID and key material as a primary key, but in a different AWS Region, use the  ReplicateKey operation. To change a replica key to a primary key, and its primary key to a replica key, use the  UpdatePrimaryRegion operation.

     

    This operation supports *multi-Region keys* , an AWS KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable CMKs in different AWS Regions. Because these CMKs have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them to encrypt data in one AWS Region and decrypt it in a different AWS Region without making a cross-Region call or exposing the plaintext data. For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Using multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    You can create symmetric and asymmetric multi-Region keys and multi-Region keys with imported key material. You cannot create multi-Region keys in a custom key store.

     

     

       

    To import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric CMK with no key material. To do this, use the ``Origin`` parameter of ``CreateKey`` with a value of ``EXTERNAL`` . Next, use  GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and import token, and use the public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use  ImportKeyMaterial with your import token to import the key material. For step-by-step instructions, see `Importing Key Material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html>`__ in the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* * . You cannot import the key material into an asymmetric CMK.

     

    To create a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, use the ``Origin`` parameter of ``CreateKey`` with a value of ``EXTERNAL`` and the ``MultiRegion`` parameter with a value of ``True`` . To create replicas of the multi-Region primary key, use the  ReplicateKey operation. For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Using multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     

      Custom key store  

    To create a symmetric CMK in a `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ , use the ``CustomKeyStoreId`` parameter to specify the custom key store. You must also use the ``Origin`` parameter with a value of ``AWS_CLOUDHSM`` . The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the AWS Region. 

     

    You cannot create an asymmetric CMK or a multi-Region CMK in a custom key store. For information about custom key stores in AWS KMS see `Using Custom Key Stores <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ in the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* * .

    :type Policy: string
    :param Policy: 

      The key policy to attach to the CMK.

       

      If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:

       

       
      * If you don't set ``BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck`` to true, the key policy must allow the principal that is making the ``CreateKey`` request to make a subsequent  PutKeyPolicy request on the CMK. This reduces the risk that the CMK becomes unmanageable. For more information, refer to the scenario in the `Default Key Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam>`__ section of the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* * . 
       
      * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal (for example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately visible to AWS KMS. For more information, see `Changes that I make are not always immediately visible <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency>`__ in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide* . 
       

       

      If you do not provide a key policy, AWS KMS attaches a default key policy to the CMK. For more information, see `Default Key Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . 

       

      The key policy size quota is 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes).

       

      For help writing and formatting a JSON policy document, see the `IAM JSON Policy Reference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html>`__ in the * *IAM User Guide* * .

      

    
    :type Description: string
    :param Description: 

      A description of the CMK.

       

      Use a description that helps you decide whether the CMK is appropriate for a task. The default value is an empty string (no description).

      

    
    :type KeyUsage: string
    :param KeyUsage: 

      Determines the `cryptographic operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ for which you can use the CMK. The default value is ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`` . This parameter is required only for asymmetric CMKs. You can't change the ``KeyUsage`` value after the CMK is created.

       

      Select only one valid value.

       

       
      * For symmetric CMKs, omit the parameter or specify ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`` . 
       
      * For asymmetric CMKs with RSA key material, specify ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`` or ``SIGN_VERIFY`` . 
       
      * For asymmetric CMKs with ECC key material, specify ``SIGN_VERIFY`` . 
       

      

    
    :type CustomerMasterKeySpec: string
    :param CustomerMasterKeySpec: 

      Specifies the type of CMK to create. The default value, ``SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`` , creates a CMK with a 256-bit symmetric key for encryption and decryption. For help choosing a key spec for your CMK, see `How to Choose Your CMK Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-choose.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

       

      The ``CustomerMasterKeySpec`` determines whether the CMK contains a symmetric key or an asymmetric key pair. It also determines the encryption algorithms or signing algorithms that the CMK supports. You can't change the ``CustomerMasterKeySpec`` after the CMK is created. To further restrict the algorithms that can be used with the CMK, use a condition key in its key policy or IAM policy. For more information, see `kms\:EncryptionAlgorithm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html#conditions-kms-encryption-algorithm>`__ or `kms\:Signing Algorithm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html#conditions-kms-signing-algorithm>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

       

      .. warning::

         

         `AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS <http://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration>`__ use symmetric CMKs to protect your data. These services do not support asymmetric CMKs. For help determining whether a CMK is symmetric or asymmetric, see `Identifying Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/find-symm-asymm.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

         

       

      AWS KMS supports the following key specs for CMKs:

       

       
      * Symmetric key (default) 

         
        * ``SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`` (AES-256-GCM) 
         

       
       
      * Asymmetric RSA key pairs 

         
        * ``RSA_2048``   
         
        * ``RSA_3072``   
         
        * ``RSA_4096``   
         

       
       
      * Asymmetric NIST-recommended elliptic curve key pairs

        * ``ECC_NIST_P521`` (secp521r1) 
         

       
       
      * Other asymmetric elliptic curve key pairs 

         
        * ``ECC_SECG_P256K1`` (secp256k1), commonly used for cryptocurrencies. 
         

       
       

      

    
    :type Origin: string
    :param Origin: 

      The source of the key material for the CMK. You cannot change the origin after you create the CMK. The default is ``AWS_KMS`` , which means that AWS KMS creates the key material.

       

      To create a CMK with no key material (for imported key material), set the value to ``EXTERNAL`` . For more information about importing key material into AWS KMS, see `Importing Key Material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . This value is valid only for symmetric CMKs.

       

      To create a CMK in an AWS KMS `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ and create its key material in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster, set this value to ``AWS_CLOUDHSM`` . You must also use the ``CustomKeyStoreId`` parameter to identify the custom key store. This value is valid only for symmetric CMKs.

      

    
    :type CustomKeyStoreId: string
    :param CustomKeyStoreId: 

      Creates the CMK in the specified `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ and the key material in its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. To create a CMK in a custom key store, you must also specify the ``Origin`` parameter with a value of ``AWS_CLOUDHSM`` . The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least two active HSMs, each in a different Availability Zone in the Region.

       

      This parameter is valid only for symmetric CMKs and regional CMKs. You cannot create an asymmetric CMK or a multi-Region CMK in a custom key store.

       

      To find the ID of a custom key store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

       

      The response includes the custom key store ID and the ID of the AWS CloudHSM cluster.

       

      This operation is part of the `Custom Key Store feature <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

      

    
    :type BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck: boolean
    :param BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck: 

      A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy lockout safety check.

       

      .. warning::

         

        Setting this value to true increases the risk that the CMK becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.

         

        For more information, refer to the scenario in the `Default Key Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam>`__ section in the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* * .

         

       

      Use this parameter only when you include a policy in the request and you intend to prevent the principal that is making the request from making a subsequent  PutKeyPolicy request on the CMK.

       

      The default value is false.

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      Assigns one or more tags to the CMK. Use this parameter to tag the CMK when it is created. To tag an existing CMK, use the  TagResource operation.

       

      .. note::

         

        Tagging or untagging a CMK can allow or deny permission to the CMK. For details, see `Using ABAC in AWS KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

         

       

      To use this parameter, you must have `kms\:TagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ permission in an IAM policy.

       

      Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null) string. You cannot have more than one tag on a CMK with the same tag key. If you specify an existing tag key with a different tag value, AWS KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one.

       

      When you assign tags to an AWS resource, AWS generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a CMK. For details, see `Tagging Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html>`__ .

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A key-value pair. A tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Tag keys and tag values are both required, but tag values can be empty (null) strings.

         

        For information about the rules that apply to tag keys and tag values, see `User-Defined Tag Restrictions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation-tag-restrictions.html>`__ in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide* .

        

      
        - **TagKey** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The key of the tag.

          

        
        - **TagValue** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value of the tag.

          

        
      
  
    :type MultiRegion: boolean
    :param MultiRegion: 

      Creates a multi-Region primary key that you can replicate into other AWS Regions. You cannot change this value after you create the CMK. 

       

      For a multi-Region key, set this parameter to ``True`` . For a single-Region CMK, omit this parameter or set it to ``False`` . The default value is ``False`` .

       

      This operation supports *multi-Region keys* , an AWS KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable CMKs in different AWS Regions. Because these CMKs have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them to encrypt data in one AWS Region and decrypt it in a different AWS Region without making a cross-Region call or exposing the plaintext data. For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Using multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

       

      This value creates a *primary key* , not a replica. To create a *replica key* , use the  ReplicateKey operation. 

       

      You can create a symmetric or asymmetric multi-Region CMK, and you can create a multi-Region CMK with imported key material. However, you cannot create a multi-Region CMK in a custom key store.

          - **MultiRegion** *(boolean) --* 

            Indicates whether the CMK is a multi-Region (``True`` ) or regional (``False`` ) key. This value is ``True`` for multi-Region primary and replica CMKs and ``False`` for regional CMKs.

             

            For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Using multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

            
          

          - **MultiRegionConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

            Lists the primary and replica CMKs in same multi-Region CMK. This field is present only when the value of the ``MultiRegion`` field is ``True`` .

             

            For more information about any listed CMK, use the  DescribeKey operation.

             

             
            * ``MultiRegionKeyType`` indicates whether the CMK is a ``PRIMARY`` or ``REPLICA`` key.

              - **Arn** *(string) --* 

                Displays the key ARN of a primary or replica key of a multi-Region key.

                
              

              - **Region** *(string) --* 

                Displays the AWS Region of a primary or replica key in a multi-Region key.

                
          
            

            - **ReplicaKeys** *(list) --* 

              displays the key ARNs and Regions of all replica keys. This field includes the current CMK if it is a replica key.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Describes the primary or replica key in a multi-Region key.

                
                

                - **Arn** *(string) --* 

                  Displays the key ARN of a primary or replica key of a multi-Region key.

                  
                

                - **Region** *(string) --* 

                  Displays the AWS Region of a primary or replica key in a multi-Region key.

                  
            
          
        
          

          - **PendingDeletionWindowInDays** *(integer) --* 

            The waiting period before the primary key in a multi-Region key is deleted. This waiting period begins when the last of its replica keys is deleted. This value is present only when the ``KeyState`` of the CMK is ``PendingReplicaDeletion`` . That indicates that the CMK is the primary key in a multi-Region key, it is scheduled for deletion, and it still has existing replica keys.

             

            When a regional CMK or a replica key in a multi-Region key is scheduled for deletion, its deletion date is displayed in the ``DeletionDate`` field. However, when the primary key in a multi-Region key is scheduled for deletion, its waiting period doesn't begin until all of its replica keys are deleted. This value displays that waiting period. When the last replica key in the multi-Region key is deleted, the ``KeyState`` of the scheduled primary key changes from ``PendingReplicaDeletion`` to ``PendingDeletion`` and the deletion date appears in the ``DeletionDate`` field.

  .. py:method:: decrypt(**kwargs)

    

    Decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted by a AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) using any of the following operations:

     

     
    *  Encrypt   
     
    *  GenerateDataKey   
     
    *  GenerateDataKeyPair   
     
    *  GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext   
     
    *  GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext   
     

     

    You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted under a symmetric or asymmetric CMK. When the CMK is asymmetric, you must specify the CMK and the encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see `Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of AWS KMS by the public key in an AWS KMS asymmetric CMK. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the `AWS Encryption SDK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/>`__ or `Amazon S3 client-side encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html>`__ . These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS.

     

    If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, the ``KeyId`` parameter is optional. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the CMK ID. However, specifying the CMK is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the ``KeyId`` parameter to specify a CMK, AWS KMS only uses the CMK you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different CMK, the ``Decrypt`` operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the CMK that you intend.

     

    Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the ``Decrypt`` operation on a particular CMK, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user ``Decrypt`` permission on all CMKs. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by CMKs in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account CMK permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for ``Decrypt`` permissions, limit the user to particular CMKs or particular trusted accounts. For details, see `Best practices for IAM policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/iam-policies.html#iam-policies-best-practices>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : Yes. You can decrypt a ciphertext using a CMK in a different AWS account.

     

     **Required permissions** : `kms\:Decrypt <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ (key policy)

      )
    :type CiphertextBlob: bytes
    :param CiphertextBlob: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Ciphertext to be decrypted. The blob includes metadata.

      

    
    :type EncryptionContext: dict
    :param EncryptionContext: 

      Specifies the encryption context to use when decrypting the data. An encryption context is valid only for `cryptographic operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ with a symmetric CMK. The standard asymmetric encryption algorithms that AWS KMS uses do not support an encryption context.

       

      An *encryption context* is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represents additional authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption context is optional when encrypting with a symmetric CMK, but it is highly recommended.

       

      For more information, see `Encryption Context <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

      A list of grant tokens. 

       

      Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes from a newly created grant that has not yet achieved eventual consistency. Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes from a new grant that has not yet achieved *eventual consistency* . For more information, see `Grant token <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#grant_token>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

    :type KeyId: string
    :param KeyId: 

      Specifies the customer master key (CMK) that AWS KMS uses to decrypt the ciphertext. Enter a key ID of the CMK that was used to encrypt the ciphertext.

       

      This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK. If you used a symmetric CMK, AWS KMS can get the CMK from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. However, it is always recommended as a best practice. This practice ensures that you use the CMK that you intend.

       

      To specify a CMK, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with ``"alias/"`` . To specify a CMK in a different AWS account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

       

      For example:

       

       
      * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
       
      * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
       
      * Alias name: ``alias/ExampleAlias``   
       
      * Alias ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias``   
       

       

      To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases .

      

    
    :type EncryptionAlgorithm: string
    :param EncryptionAlgorithm: 

      Specifies the encryption algorithm that will be used to decrypt the ciphertext. Specify the same algorithm that was used to encrypt the data. If you specify a different algorithm, the ``Decrypt`` operation fails.

       

      This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK. The default value, ``SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`` , represents the only supported algorithm that is valid for symmetric CMKs.

    Deletes the specified alias. 

     

    .. note::

       

      Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the CMK. For details, see `Using ABAC in AWS KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

       

     

    Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the  DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs, use the  ListAliases operation. 

     

    Each CMK can have multiple aliases. To change the alias of a CMK, use  DeleteAlias to delete the current alias and  CreateAlias to create a new alias. To associate an existing alias with a different customer master key (CMK), call  UpdateAlias .

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account.

  .. py:method:: delete_custom_key_store(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes a `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ . This operation does not delete the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, or affect any users or keys in the cluster.

     

    The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any AWS KMS `customer master keys (CMKs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys>`__ . Before deleting the key store, verify that you will never need to use any of the CMKs in the key store for any `cryptographic operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ . Then, use  ScheduleKeyDeletion to delete the AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) from the key store. When the scheduled waiting period expires, the ``ScheduleKeyDeletion`` operation deletes the CMKs. Then it makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might need to manually `delete the orphaned key material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key>`__ from the cluster and its backups.

     

    After all CMKs are deleted from AWS KMS, use  DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect the key store from AWS KMS. Then, you can delete the custom key store.

     

    Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using  DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect it from AWS KMS. While the key store is disconnected, you cannot create or use the CMKs in the key store. But, you do not need to delete CMKs and you can reconnect a disconnected custom key store at any time.

     

    If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.

     

    This operation is part of the `Custom Key Store feature <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different AWS account.

  .. py:method:: delete_imported_key_material(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes key material that you previously imported. This operation makes the specified customer master key (CMK) unusable. For more information about importing key material into AWS KMS, see `Importing Key Material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . 

     

    When the specified CMK is in the ``PendingDeletion`` state, this operation does not change the CMK's state. Otherwise, it changes the CMK's state to ``PendingImport`` .

     

    After you delete key material, you can use  ImportKeyMaterial to reimport the same key material into the CMK.

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

  .. py:method:: describe_custom_key_stores(**kwargs)

    

    Gets information about `custom key stores <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ in the account and Region.

     

    This operation is part of the `Custom Key Store feature <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

     

    By default, this operation returns information about all custom key stores in the account and Region. To get only information about a particular custom key store, use either the ``CustomKeyStoreName`` or ``CustomKeyStoreId`` parameter (but not both).

     

    To determine whether the custom key store is connected to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, use the ``ConnectionState`` element in the response. If an attempt to connect the custom key store failed, the ``ConnectionState`` value is ``FAILED`` and the ``ConnectionErrorCode`` element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help interpreting the ``ConnectionErrorCode`` , see  CustomKeyStoresListEntry .

     

    Custom key stores have a ``DISCONNECTED`` connection state if the key store has never been connected or you use the  DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. If your custom key store state is ``CONNECTED`` but you are having trouble using it, make sure that its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster is active and contains the minimum number of HSMs required for the operation, if any.

     

    For help repairing your custom key store, see the `Troubleshooting Custom Key Stores <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html>`__ topic in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

              Valid values are:

               

               
              * ``CLUSTER_NOT_FOUND`` - AWS KMS cannot find the AWS CloudHSM cluster with the specified cluster ID. 
               
              * ``INSUFFICIENT_CLOUDHSM_HSMS`` - The associated AWS CloudHSM cluster does not contain any active HSMs. To connect a custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, the cluster must contain at least one active HSM. 
               
              * ``INTERNAL_ERROR`` - AWS KMS could not complete the request due to an internal error. Retry the request. For ``ConnectCustomKeyStore`` requests, disconnect the custom key store before trying to connect again. 
               
              * ``INVALID_CREDENTIALS`` - AWS KMS does not have the correct password for the ``kmsuser`` crypto user in the AWS CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, you must change the ``kmsuser`` account password and update the key store password value for the custom key store. 
               
              * ``NETWORK_ERRORS`` - Network errors are preventing AWS KMS from connecting to the custom key store. 
               
              * ``SUBNET_NOT_FOUND`` - A subnet in the AWS CloudHSM cluster configuration was deleted. If AWS KMS cannot find all of the subnets in the cluster configuration, attempts to connect the custom key store to the AWS CloudHSM cluster fail. To fix this error, create a cluster from a recent backup and associate it with your custom key store. (This process creates a new cluster configuration with a VPC and private subnets.) For details, see `How to Fix a Connection Failure <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-failed>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . 
               
              * ``USER_LOCKED_OUT`` - The ``kmsuser`` CU account is locked out of the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster due to too many failed password attempts. Before you can connect your custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, you must change the ``kmsuser`` account password and update the key store password value for the custom key store. 
               
              * ``USER_LOGGED_IN`` - The ``kmsuser`` CU account is logged into the the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from rotating the ``kmsuser`` account password and logging into the cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, you must log the ``kmsuser`` CU out of the cluster. If you changed the ``kmsuser`` password to log into the cluster, you must also and update the key store password value for the custom key store. For help, see `How to Log Out and Reconnect <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#login-kmsuser-2>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . 
               
              * ``USER_NOT_FOUND`` - AWS KMS cannot find a ``kmsuser`` CU account in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, you must create a ``kmsuser`` CU account in the cluster, and then update the key store password value for the custom key store. 
               

              
            

            - **CreationDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time when the custom key store was created.

              
        
      
        

        - **NextMarker** *(string) --* 

          When ``Truncated`` is true, this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent request.

          
        

        - **Truncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items in the list. When this value is true, the list in this response is truncated. To get more items, pass the value of the ``NextMarker`` element in thisresponse to the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent request.

  .. py:method:: describe_key(**kwargs)

    

    Provides detailed information about a customer master key (CMK). You can run ``DescribeKey`` on a `customer managed CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk>`__ or an `AWS managed CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk>`__ .

     

    This detailed information includes the key ARN, creation date (and deletion date, if applicable), the key state, and the origin and expiration date (if any) of the key material. For CMKs in custom key stores, it includes information about the custom key store, such as the key store ID and the AWS CloudHSM cluster ID. It includes fields, like ``KeySpec`` , that help you distinguish symmetric from asymmetric CMKs. It also provides information that is particularly important to asymmetric CMKs, such as the key usage (encryption or signing) and the encryption algorithms or signing algorithms that the CMK supports.

     

     ``DescribeKey`` does not return the following information:

     

     
    * Aliases associated with the CMK. To get this information, use  ListAliases . 
     
    * Whether automatic key rotation is enabled on the CMK. To get this information, use  GetKeyRotationStatus . Also, some key states prevent a CMK from being automatically rotated. For details, see `How Automatic Key Rotation Works <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html#rotate-keys-how-it-works>`__ in *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . 
     
    * Tags on the CMK. To get this information, use  ListResourceTags . 
     
    * Key policies and grants on the CMK. To get this information, use  GetKeyPolicy and  ListGrants . 
     

     

    If you call the ``DescribeKey`` operation on a *predefined AWS alias* , that is, an AWS alias with no key ID, AWS KMS creates an `AWS managed CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys>`__ . Then, it associates the alias with the new CMK, and returns the ``KeyId`` and ``Arn`` of the new CMK in the response.

     

     **Cross-account use** : Yes. To perform this operation with a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the ``KeyId`` parameter.

      Describes the specified customer master key (CMK). 

       

      If you specify a predefined AWS alias (an AWS alias with no key ID), KMS associates the alias with an `AWS managed CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys>`__ and returns its ``KeyId`` and ``Arn`` in the response.

       

      To specify a CMK, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with ``"alias/"`` . To specify a CMK in a different AWS account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

       

      For example:

       

       
      * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``

          - **SigningAlgorithms** *(list) --* 

            The signing algorithms that the CMK supports. You cannot use the CMK with other signing algorithms within AWS KMS.

             

            This field appears only when the ``KeyUsage`` of the CMK is ``SIGN_VERIFY`` .

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **MultiRegion** *(boolean) --* 

            Indicates whether the CMK is a multi-Region (``True`` ) or regional (``False`` ) key. This value is ``True`` for multi-Region primary and replica CMKs and ``False`` for regional CMKs.

             

            For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Using multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

            
          

          - **MultiRegionConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

            Lists the primary and replica CMKs in same multi-Region CMK. This field is present only when the value of the ``MultiRegion`` field is ``True`` .

             

            For more information about any listed CMK, use the  DescribeKey operation.

             

             
            * ``MultiRegionKeyType`` indicates whether the CMK is a ``PRIMARY`` or ``REPLICA`` key. 
             
            * ``PrimaryKey`` displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key. This field displays the current CMK if it is the primary key. 
             
            * ``ReplicaKeys`` displays the key ARNs and Regions of all replica keys. This field includes the current CMK if it is a replica key. 
             

            
            

            - **MultiRegionKeyType** *(string) --* 

              Indicates whether the CMK is a ``PRIMARY`` or ``REPLICA`` key.

              
            

            - **PrimaryKey** *(dict) --* 

              Displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key. This field includes the current CMK if it is the primary key.

              
              

              - **Arn** *(string) --* 

                Displays the key ARN of a primary or replica key of a multi-Region key.

                
              

              - **Region** *(string) --* 

                Displays the AWS Region of a primary or replica key in a multi-Region key.

                
          
            

            - **ReplicaKeys** *(list) --* 

              displays the key ARNs and Regions of all replica keys. This field includes the current CMK if it is a replica key.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Describes the primary or replica key in a multi-Region key.

                
                

                - **Arn** *(string) --* 

                  Displays the key ARN of a primary or replica key of a multi-Region key.

                  
                

                - **Region** *(string) --* 

                  Displays the AWS Region of a primary or replica key in a multi-Region key.

                  
            
          
        
          

          - **PendingDeletionWindowInDays** *(integer) --* 

            The waiting period before the primary key in a multi-Region key is deleted. This waiting period begins when the last of its replica keys is deleted. This value is present only when the ``KeyState`` of the CMK is ``PendingReplicaDeletion`` . That indicates that the CMK is the primary key in a multi-Region key, it is scheduled for deletion, and it still has existing replica keys.

             

            When a regional CMK or a replica key in a multi-Region key is scheduled for deletion, its deletion date is displayed in the ``DeletionDate`` field. However, when the primary key in a multi-Region key is scheduled for deletion, its waiting period doesn't begin until all of its replica keys are deleted. This value displays that waiting period. When the last replica key in the multi-Region key is deleted, the ``KeyState`` of the scheduled primary key changes from ``PendingReplicaDeletion`` to ``PendingDeletion`` and the deletion date appears in the ``DeletionDate`` field.

  .. py:method:: disconnect_custom_key_store(**kwargs)

    

    Disconnects the `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ from its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. While a custom key store is disconnected, you can manage the custom key store and its customer master keys (CMKs), but you cannot create or use CMKs in the custom key store. You can reconnect the custom key store at any time.

     

    .. note::

       

      While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create customer master keys (CMKs) in the custom key store or to use existing CMKs in `cryptographic operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ will fail. This action can prevent users from storing and accessing sensitive data.

       

     

    

     

    To find the connection state of a custom key store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. To reconnect a custom key store, use the  ConnectCustomKeyStore operation.

     

    If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.

     

    This operation is part of the `Custom Key Store feature <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different AWS account.

  .. py:method:: encrypt(**kwargs)

    

    Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customer master key (CMK). The ``Encrypt`` operation has two primary use cases:

     

     
    * You can encrypt small amounts of arbitrary data, such as a personal identifier or database password, or other sensitive information.  
     
    * You can use the ``Encrypt`` operation to move encrypted data from one AWS Region to another. For example, in Region A, generate a data key and use the plaintext key to encrypt your data. Then, in Region A, use the ``Encrypt`` operation to encrypt the plaintext data key under a CMK in Region B. Now, you can move the encrypted data and the encrypted data key to Region B. When necessary, you can decrypt the encrypted data key and the encrypted data entirely within in Region B. 
     

     

    You don't need to use the ``Encrypt`` operation to encrypt a data key. The  GenerateDataKey and  GenerateDataKeyPair operations return a plaintext data key and an encrypted copy of that data key.

     

    When you encrypt data, you must specify a symmetric or asymmetric CMK to use in the encryption operation. The CMK must have a ``KeyUsage`` value of ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.`` To find the ``KeyUsage`` of a CMK, use the  DescribeKey operation. 

     

    If you use a symmetric CMK, you can use an encryption context to add additional security to your encryption operation. If you specify an ``EncryptionContext`` when encrypting data, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the data. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an ``InvalidCiphertextException`` . For more information, see `Encryption Context <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    If you specify an asymmetric CMK, you must also specify the encryption algorithm. The algorithm must be compatible with the CMK type.

     

    .. warning::

       

      When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.

       

      You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.

       

     

    The maximum size of the data that you can encrypt varies with the type of CMK and the encryption algorithm that you choose.

This operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key and a copy that is encrypted under a customer master key (CMK) that you specify. You can use the plaintext key to encrypt your data outside of AWS KMS and store the encrypted data key with the encrypted data.

     

     ``GenerateDataKey`` returns a unique data key for each request. The bytes in the plaintext key are not related to the caller or the CMK.

     

    To generate a data key, specify the symmetric CMK that will be used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric CMK to generate data keys. To get the type of your CMK, use the  DescribeKey operation. You must also specify the length of the data key. Use either the ``KeySpec`` or ``NumberOfBytes`` parameters (but not both). For 128-bit and 256-bit data keys, use the ``KeySpec`` parameter. 

     

    To get only an encrypted copy of the data key, use  GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext . To generate an asymmetric data key pair, use the  GenerateDataKeyPair or  GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operation. To get a cryptographically secure random byte string, use  GenerateRandom .

     

    You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. If you specify an ``EncryptionContext`` , you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an ``InvalidCiphertextException`` . For more information, see `Encryption Context <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **How to use your data key**  

     

    We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your application. You can write your own code or use a client-side encryption library, such as the `AWS Encryption SDK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/>`__ , the `Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb-encryption-client/latest/devguide/>`__ , or `Amazon S3 client-side encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html>`__ to do these tasks for you.

     

    To encrypt data outside of AWS KMS:

     

     
    * Use the ``GenerateDataKey`` operation to get a data key. 
     
    * Use the plaintext data key (in the ``Plaintext`` field of the response) to encrypt your data outside of AWS KMS. Then erase the plaintext data key from memory. 
     
    * Store the encrypted data key (in the ``CiphertextBlob`` field of the response) with the encrypted data. 
     

     

    To decrypt data outside of AWS KMS:

     

     
    * Use the  Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key. The operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key. 
     
    * Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data outside of AWS KMS, then erase the plaintext data key from memory. 
     

     

     **Cross-account use** : Yes. To perform this operation with a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the ``KeyId`` parameter.

    :type EncryptionContext: dict
    :param EncryptionContext: 

      Specifies the encryption context that will be used when encrypting the data key.

       

      An *encryption context* is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represents additional authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption context is optional when encrypting with a symmetric CMK, but it is highly recommended.

  .. py:method:: generate_data_key_pair(**kwargs)

    

    Generates a unique asymmetric data key pair. The ``GenerateDataKeyPair`` operation returns a plaintext public key, a plaintext private key, and a copy of the private key that is encrypted under the symmetric CMK you specify. You can use the data key pair to perform asymmetric cryptography outside of AWS KMS.

     

     ``GenerateDataKeyPair`` returns a unique data key pair for each request. The bytes in the keys are not related to the caller or the CMK that is used to encrypt the private key.

     

    You can use the public key that ``GenerateDataKeyPair`` returns to encrypt data or verify a signature outside of AWS KMS. Then, store the encrypted private key with the data. When you are ready to decrypt data or sign a message, you can use the  Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted private key.

     

    To generate a data key pair, you must specify a symmetric customer master key (CMK) to encrypt the private key in a data key pair. You cannot use an asymmetric CMK or a CMK in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your CMK, use the  DescribeKey operation. 

     

    If you are using the data key pair to encrypt data, or for any operation where you don't immediately need a private key, consider using the  GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operation. ``GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext`` returns a plaintext public key and an encrypted private key, but omits the plaintext private key that you need only to decrypt ciphertext or sign a message. Later, when you need to decrypt the data or sign a message, use the  Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted private key in the data key pair.

     

    You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. If you specify an ``EncryptionContext`` , you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an ``InvalidCiphertextException`` .

      For more information, see `Encryption Context <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

    :type KeyId: string
    :param KeyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the CMK that encrypts the private key in the data key pair. You must specify a symmetric CMK. You cannot use an asymmetric CMK or a CMK in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your CMK, use the  DescribeKey operation. 

       

      To specify a CMK, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with ``"alias/"`` . To specify a CMK in a different AWS account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

       

      For example:

       

       
      * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
       
      * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
       
      * Alias name: ``alias/ExampleAlias``   
       
      * Alias ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias``   
       

       

      To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases .

      

    
    :type KeyPairSpec: string
    :param KeyPairSpec: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Determines the type of data key pair that is generated.

       

      The AWS KMS rule that restricts the use of asymmetric RSA CMKs to encrypt and decrypt or to sign and verify (but not both), and the rule that permits you to use ECC CMKs only to sign and verify, are not effective outside of AWS KMS.

      

    
    :type GrantTokens: list
    :param GrantTokens: 

      A list of grant tokens.

       

      Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes from a new grant that has not yet achieved *eventual consistency* . For more information, see `Grant token <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#grant_token>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

  .. py:method:: generate_data_key_without_plaintext(**kwargs)

    

    Generates a unique symmetric data key. This operation returns a data key that is encrypted under a customer master key (CMK) that you specify. To request an asymmetric data key pair, use the  GenerateDataKeyPair or  GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operations.

     

     ``GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`` is identical to the  GenerateDataKey operation except that returns only the encrypted copy of the data key. This operation is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some point, but not immediately. When you need to encrypt the data, you call the  Decrypt operation on the encrypted copy of the key. 

     

    It's also useful in distributed systems with different levels of trust. For example, you might store encrypted data in containers. One component of your system creates new containers and stores an encrypted data key with each container. Then, a different component puts the data into the containers. That component first decrypts the data key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt data, puts the encrypted data into the container, and then destroys the plaintext data key. In this system, the component that creates the containers never sees the plaintext data key.

     

     ``GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`` returns a unique data key for each request. The bytes in the keys are not related to the caller or CMK that is used to encrypt the private key.

     

    To generate a data key, you must specify the symmetric customer master key (CMK) that is used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric CMK to generate a data key. To get the type of your CMK, use the  DescribeKey operation.

     

    If the operation succeeds, you will find the encrypted copy of the data key in the ``CiphertextBlob`` field.

     

    You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. If you specify an ``EncryptionContext`` , you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an ``InvalidCiphertextException`` . For more information, see `Encryption Context <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : Yes. To perform this operation with a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the ``KeyId`` parameter.

      An *encryption context* is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represents additional authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption context is optional when encrypting with a symmetric CMK, but it is highly recommended.

To enable or disable automatic rotation of a set of related `multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html#mrk-replica-key>`__ , set the property on the primary key. The key rotation status for these CMKs is always ``false`` .

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     
    * Disabled: The key rotation status does not change when you disable a CMK. However, while the CMK is disabled, AWS KMS does not rotate the backing key. 
     
    * Pending deletion: While a CMK is pending deletion, its key rotation status is ``false`` and AWS KMS does not rotate the backing key. If you cancel the deletion, the original key rotation status is restored. 
     

     

     **Cross-account use** : Yes. To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN in the value of the ``KeyId`` parameter.

    Returns the items you need to import key material into a symmetric, customer managed customer master key (CMK). For more information about importing key material into AWS KMS, see `Importing Key Material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    This operation returns a public key and an import token. Use the public key to encrypt the symmetric key material. Store the import token to send with a subsequent  ImportKeyMaterial request.

     

    You must specify the key ID of the symmetric CMK into which you will import key material. This CMK's ``Origin`` must be ``EXTERNAL`` . You must also specify the wrapping algorithm and type of wrapping key (public key) that you will use to encrypt the key material. You cannot perform this operation on an asymmetric CMK or on any CMK in a different AWS account.

     

    To import key material, you must use the public key and import token from the same response. These items are valid for 24 hours. The expiration date and time appear in the ``GetParametersForImport`` response. You cannot use an expired token in an  ImportKeyMaterial request. If your key and token expire, send another ``GetParametersForImport`` request.

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

  .. py:method:: get_public_key(**kwargs)

    

    Returns the public key of an asymmetric CMK. Unlike the private key of a asymmetric CMK, which never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted, callers with ``kms:GetPublicKey`` permission can download the public key of an asymmetric CMK. You can share the public key to allow others to encrypt messages and verify signatures outside of AWS KMS. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see `Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key within AWS KMS by calling the  Encrypt ,  ReEncrypt , or  Verify operations with the identifier of an asymmetric CMK. When you use the public key within AWS KMS, you benefit from the authentication, authorization, and logging that are part of every AWS KMS operation. You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These features are not effective outside of AWS KMS. For details, see `Special Considerations for Downloading Public Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/download-public-key.html#download-public-key-considerations>`__ .

     

    To help you use the public key safely outside of AWS KMS, ``GetPublicKey`` returns important information about the public key in the response, including:

     

     
    * `CustomerMasterKeySpec <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-CustomerMasterKeySpec>`__ : The type of key material in the public key, such as ``RSA_4096`` or ``ECC_NIST_P521`` . 
     
    * `KeyUsage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-KeyUsage>`__ : Whether the key is used for encryption or signing. 
     
    * `EncryptionAlgorithms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-EncryptionAlgorithms>`__ or `SigningAlgorithms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-SigningAlgorithms>`__ : A list of the encryption algorithms or the signing algorithms for the key. 
     

     

    Although AWS KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations, it is crucial that you use this information to prevent the public key from being used improperly. For example, you can prevent a public signing key from being used encrypt data, or prevent a public key from being used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported by AWS KMS. You can also avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm in a verification operation.

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : Yes. To perform this operation with a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the ``KeyId`` parameter.

  .. py:method:: import_key_material(**kwargs)

    

    Imports key material into an existing symmetric AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) that was created without key material. After you successfully import key material into a CMK, you can `reimport the same key material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html#reimport-key-material>`__ into that CMK, but you cannot import different key material. 

     

    You cannot perform this operation on an asymmetric CMK or on any CMK in a different AWS account. For more information about creating CMKs with no key material and then importing key material, see `Importing Key Material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    Before using this operation, call  GetParametersForImport . Its response includes a public key and an import token. Use the public key to encrypt the key material. Then, submit the import token from the same ``GetParametersForImport`` response.

     

    When calling this operation, you must specify the following values:

     

     
    * The key ID or key ARN of a CMK with no key material. Its ``Origin`` must be ``EXTERNAL`` . To create a CMK with no key material, call  CreateKey and set the value of its ``Origin`` parameter to ``EXTERNAL`` . To get the ``Origin`` of a CMK, call  DescribeKey .) 
     
    * The encrypted key material. To get the public key to encrypt the key material, call  GetParametersForImport . 
     
    * The import token that  GetParametersForImport returned. You must use a public key and token from the same ``GetParametersForImport`` response. 
     
    * Whether the key material expires and if so, when. If you set an expiration date, AWS KMS deletes the key material from the CMK on the specified date, and the CMK becomes unusable. To use the CMK again, you must reimport the same key material. The only way to change an expiration date is by reimporting the same key material and specifying a new expiration date.  
     

     

    When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes from ``PendingImport`` to ``Enabled`` , and you can use the CMK.

     

    If this operation fails, use the exception to help determine the problem. If the error is related to the key material, the import token, or wrapping key, use  GetParametersForImport to get a new public key and import token for the CMK and repeat the import procedure. For help, see `How To Import Key Material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html#importing-keys-overview>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account.

    :type ExpirationModel: string
    :param ExpirationModel: 

      Specifies whether the key material expires. The default is ``KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES`` , in which case you must include the ``ValidTo`` parameter. When this parameter is set to ``KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE`` , you must omit the ``ValidTo`` parameter.

  .. py:method:: list_aliases(**kwargs)

    

    Gets a list of aliases in the caller's AWS account and region. For more information about aliases, see  CreateAlias .

     

    By default, the ``ListAliases`` operation returns all aliases in the account and region. To get only the aliases associated with a particular customer master key (CMK), use the ``KeyId`` parameter.

     

    The ``ListAliases`` response can include aliases that you created and associated with your customer managed CMKs, and aliases that AWS created and associated with AWS managed CMKs in your account. You can recognize AWS aliases because their names have the format ``aws/<service-name>`` , such as ``aws/dynamodb`` .

     

    The response might also include aliases that have no ``TargetKeyId`` field. These are predefined aliases that AWS has created but has not yet associated with a CMK. Aliases that AWS creates in your account, including predefined aliases, do not count against your `AWS KMS aliases quota <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html#aliases-limit>`__ .

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. ``ListAliases`` does not return aliases in other AWS accounts.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **Grants** *(list) --* 

          A list of grants.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Contains information about a grant.

            
            

            - **KeyId** *(string) --* 

              The unique identifier for the customer master key (CMK) to which the grant applies.

              
            

            - **GrantId** *(string) --* 

              The unique identifier for the grant.

              
            

            - **Name** *(string) --* 

              The friendly name that identifies the grant. If a name was provided in the  CreateGrant request, that name is returned. Otherwise this value is null.

              
            

            - **CreationDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time when the grant was created.

              
            

            - **GranteePrincipal** *(string) --* 

              The identity that gets the permissions in the grant.

               

              The ``GranteePrincipal`` field in the ``ListGrants`` response usually contains the user or role designated as the grantee principal in the grant. However, when the grantee principal in the grant is an AWS service, the ``GranteePrincipal`` field contains the `service principal <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html#principal-services>`__ , which might represent several different grantee principals.

              
            

            - **RetiringPrincipal** *(string) --* 

              The principal that can retire the grant.

              
            

            - **IssuingAccount** *(string) --*

              - **EncryptionContextSubset** *(dict) --* 

                A list of key-value pairs that must be included in the encryption context of the `cryptographic operation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ request. The grant allows the cryptographic operation only when the encryption context in the request includes the key-value pairs specified in this constraint, although it can include additional key-value pairs.

                
                

                - *(string) --*

              - **EncryptionContextEquals** *(dict) --* 

                A list of key-value pairs that must match the encryption context in the `cryptographic operation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ request. The grant allows the operation only when the encryption context in the request is the same as the encryption context specified in this constraint.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
            
          
          
        
      
        

        - **NextMarker** *(string) --* 

          When ``Truncated`` is true, this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent request.

          
        

        - **Truncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items in the list. When this value is true, the list in this response is truncated. To get more items, pass the value of the ``NextMarker`` element in thisresponse to the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent request.

      To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey .

      

    
    :type Limit: integer
    :param Limit: 

      Use this parameter to specify the maximum number of items to return. When this value is present, AWS KMS does not return more than the specified number of items, but it might return fewer.

       

      This value is optional. If you include a value, it must be between 1 and 50, inclusive. If you do not include a value, it defaults to 50.

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter in a subsequent request after you receive a response with truncated results. Set it to the value of ``NextMarker`` from the truncated response you just received.

       

      Do not attempt to construct this value. Use only the value of ``NextMarker`` from the truncated response you just received.

      Sets the key policy on the specified customer master key (CMK).

       

      Specify the key ID or key ARN of the CMK.

       

      For example:

    :type Policy: string
    :param Policy: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The key policy to attach to the CMK.

       

      The key policy must meet the following criteria:

       

       
      * If you don't set ``BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck`` to true, the key policy must allow the principal that is making the ``PutKeyPolicy`` request to make a subsequent ``PutKeyPolicy`` request on the CMK. This reduces the risk that the CMK becomes unmanageable. For more information, refer to the scenario in the `Default Key Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam>`__ section of the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . 
       
      * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal (for example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately visible to AWS KMS. For more information, see `Changes that I make are not always immediately visible <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency>`__ in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide* .

      A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy lockout safety check.

       

      .. warning::

         

        Setting this value to true increases the risk that the CMK becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.

  .. py:method:: re_encrypt(**kwargs)

    

    Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within AWS KMS. You can use this operation to change the customer master key (CMK) under which data is encrypted, such as when you `manually rotate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html#rotate-keys-manually>`__ a CMK or change the CMK that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same CMK, such as to change the `encryption context <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context>`__ of a ciphertext.

     

    The ``ReEncrypt`` operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using an AWS KMS CMK in an AWS KMS operation, such as  Encrypt or  GenerateDataKey . It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an `asymmetric CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#asymmetric-cmks>`__ outside of AWS KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the `AWS Encryption SDK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/>`__ or `Amazon S3 client-side encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html>`__ . These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS.

     

    When you use the ``ReEncrypt`` operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.

     

     
    * If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK, you must use the ``SourceKeyId`` parameter to identify the CMK that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data. 
     
    * If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, the ``SourceKeyId`` parameter is optional. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the CMK ID. However, specifying the source CMK is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the ``SourceKeyId`` parameter to specify a CMK, AWS KMS uses only the CMK you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different CMK, the ``ReEncrypt`` operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the CMK that you intend. 
     
    * To reencrypt the data, you must use the ``DestinationKeyId`` parameter specify the CMK that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric CMK. If the destination CMK is an asymmetric CMK, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the CMK. 

    .. warning::

       When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails. You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields. 

     
     

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : Yes. The source CMK and destination CMK can be in different AWS accounts. Either or both CMKs can be in a different account than the caller.

     

     **Required permissions** :

     

     
    * `kms\:ReEncryptFrom <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ permission on the source CMK (key policy) 
     
    * `kms\:ReEncryptTo <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ permission on the destination CMK (key policy) 
     

     

    To permit reencryption from or to a CMK, include the ``"kms:ReEncrypt*"`` permission in your `key policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html>`__ . This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use the console to create a CMK. But you must include it manually when you create a CMK programmatically or when you use the  PutKeyPolicy operation to set a key policy.

      An *encryption context* is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represents additional authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption context is optional when encrypting with a symmetric CMK, but it is highly recommended.

      This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK. If you used a symmetric CMK, AWS KMS can get the CMK from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. However, it is always recommended as a best practice. This practice ensures that you use the CMK that you intend.

       

      To specify a CMK, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with ``"alias/"`` . To specify a CMK in a different AWS account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

       

      For example:

       

       
      * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``

      * Alias ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias``   
       

       

      To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases .

      

    
    :type DestinationKeyId: string
    :param DestinationKeyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A unique identifier for the CMK that is used to reencrypt the data. Specify a symmetric or asymmetric CMK with a ``KeyUsage`` value of ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`` . To find the ``KeyUsage`` value of a CMK, use the  DescribeKey operation.

       

      To specify a CMK, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with ``"alias/"`` . To specify a CMK in a different AWS account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

       

      For example:

       

       
      * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``

    :type DestinationEncryptionContext: dict
    :param DestinationEncryptionContext: 

      Specifies that encryption context to use when the reencrypting the data.

       

      A destination encryption context is valid only when the destination CMK is a symmetric CMK. The standard ciphertext format for asymmetric CMKs does not include fields for metadata.

      For more information, see `Encryption Context <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

    :type SourceEncryptionAlgorithm: string
    :param SourceEncryptionAlgorithm: 

      Specifies the encryption algorithm that AWS KMS will use to decrypt the ciphertext before it is reencrypted. The default value, ``SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`` , represents the algorithm used for symmetric CMKs.

       

      Specify the same algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. If you specify a different algorithm, the decrypt attempt fails.

       

      This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK.

      

    
    :type DestinationEncryptionAlgorithm: string
    :param DestinationEncryptionAlgorithm: 

      Specifies the encryption algorithm that AWS KMS will use to reecrypt the data after it has decrypted it. The default value, ``SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`` , represents the encryption algorithm used for symmetric CMKs.

       

      This parameter is required only when the destination CMK is an asymmetric CMK.

  .. py:method:: replicate_key(**kwargs)

    

    Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This operation creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region primary key in a different Region of the same AWS partition. You can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a different Region. To create a multi-Region primary key, use the  CreateKey operation.

     

    This operation supports *multi-Region keys* , an AWS KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable CMKs in different AWS Regions. Because these CMKs have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them to encrypt data in one AWS Region and decrypt it in a different AWS Region without making a cross-Region call or exposing the plaintext data. For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Using multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    A *replica key* is a fully-functional CMK that can be used independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. They have the same `key ID <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-id>`__ and key material. They also have the same `key spec <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-spec>`__ , `key usage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-usage>`__ , `key material origin <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-origin>`__ , and `automatic key rotation status <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html>`__ . AWS KMS automatically synchronizes these shared properties among related multi-Region keys. All other properties of a replica key can differ, including its `key policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html>`__ , `tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html>`__ , `aliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html>`__ , and `key state <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ . AWS KMS pricing and quotas for CMKs apply to each primary key and replica key.

     

    When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key state of ``Creating`` . This key state changes to ``Enabled`` (or ``PendingImport`` ) after a few seconds when the process of creating the new replica key is complete. While the key state is ``Creating`` , you can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations. If you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry on ``KMSInvalidStateException`` or call ``DescribeKey`` to check its ``KeyState`` value before using it. For details about the ``Creating`` key state, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    The AWS CloudTrail log of a ``ReplicateKey`` operation records a ``ReplicateKey`` operation in the primary key's Region and a  CreateKey operation in the replica key's Region.

     

    If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, the replica key is created with no key material. You must import the same key material that you imported into the primary key. For details, see `Importing key material into multi-Region keys <kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-import.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the  UpdatePrimaryRegion operation.

     

    .. note::

       

       ``ReplicateKey`` uses different default values for the ``KeyPolicy`` and ``Tags`` parameters than those used in the AWS KMS console. For details, see the parameter descriptions.

       

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. You cannot use this operation to create a CMK in a different AWS account. 

     

     **Required permissions** : 

     

     
    * ``kms:ReplicateKey`` on the primary CMK (in the primary CMK's Region). Include this permission in the primary CMK's key policy. 
     
    * ``kms:CreateKey`` in an IAM policy in the replica Region. 
     
    * To use the ``Tags`` parameter, ``kms:TagResource`` in an IAM policy in the replica Region. 
     

     

     **Related operations**  

     

     
    *  CreateKey   
     
    *  UpdatePrimaryRegion

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.replicate_key(
          KeyId='string',
          ReplicaRegion='string',
          Policy='string',
          BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck=True|False,
          Description='string',
          Tags=[
              {
                  'TagKey': 'string',
                  'TagValue': 'string'
              },
          ]
      )
    :type KeyId: string
    :param KeyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Identifies the multi-Region primary key that is being replicated. To determine whether a CMK is a multi-Region primary key, use the  DescribeKey operation to check the value of the ``MultiRegionKeyType`` property.

       

      Specify the key ID or key ARN of a multi-Region primary key.

       

      For example:

       

       
      * Key ID: ``mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab``   
       
      * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab``   
       

       

      To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey .

      

    
    :type ReplicaRegion: string
    :param ReplicaRegion: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Region ID of the AWS Region for this replica key. 

       

      Enter the Region ID, such as ``us-east-1`` or ``ap-southeast-2`` . For a list of AWS Regions in which AWS KMS is supported, see `AWS KMS service endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

       

      The replica must be in a different AWS Region than its primary key and other replicas of that primary key, but in the same AWS partition. AWS KMS must be available in the replica Region. If the Region is not enabled by default, the AWS account must be enabled in the Region. 

       

      For information about AWS partitions, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* . <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ For information about enabling and disabling Regions, see `Enabling a Region <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable>`__ and `Disabling a Region <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-disable>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      

    
    :type Policy: string
    :param Policy: 

      The key policy to attach to the CMK. This parameter is optional. If you do not provide a key policy, AWS KMS attaches the `default key policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default>`__ to the CMK.

       

      The key policy is not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify the same key policy or a different key policy for each key in a set of related multi-Region keys. AWS KMS does not synchronize this property.

       

      If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:

       

       
      * If you don't set ``BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck`` to true, the key policy must give the caller ``kms:PutKeyPolicy`` permission on the replica CMK. This reduces the risk that the CMK becomes unmanageable. For more information, refer to the scenario in the `Default Key Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam>`__ section of the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* * . 
       
      * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal (for example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately visible to AWS KMS. For more information, see `Changes that I make are not always immediately visible <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency>`__ in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide* . 
       
      * The key policy size quota is 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes). 
       

      

    
    :type BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck: boolean
    :param BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck: 

      A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy lockout safety check.

       

      .. warning::

         

        Setting this value to true increases the risk that the CMK becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.

         

        For more information, refer to the scenario in the `Default Key Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam>`__ section in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

         

       

      Use this parameter only when you intend to prevent the principal that is making the request from making a subsequent ``PutKeyPolicy`` request on the CMK.

       

      The default value is false.

      

    
    :type Description: string
    :param Description: 

      A description of the CMK. Use a description that helps you decide whether the CMK is appropriate for a task. The default value is an empty string (no description).

       

      The description is not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify the same description or a different description for each key in a set of related multi-Region keys. AWS KMS does not synchronize this property.

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      Assigns one or more tags to the replica key. Use this parameter to tag the CMK when it is created. To tag an existing CMK, use the  TagResource operation.

       

      .. note::

         

        Tagging or untagging a CMK can allow or deny permission to the CMK. For details, see `Using ABAC in AWS KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

         

       

      To use this parameter, you must have `kms\:TagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ permission in an IAM policy.

       

      Tags are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify the same tags or different tags for each key in a set of related multi-Region keys. AWS KMS does not synchronize this property.

       

      Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null) string. You cannot have more than one tag on a CMK with the same tag key. If you specify an existing tag key with a different tag value, AWS KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one.

       

      When you assign tags to an AWS resource, AWS generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a CMK. For details, see `Tagging Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html>`__ .

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A key-value pair. A tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Tag keys and tag values are both required, but tag values can be empty (null) strings.

         

        For information about the rules that apply to tag keys and tag values, see `User-Defined Tag Restrictions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation-tag-restrictions.html>`__ in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide* .

        

      
        - **TagKey** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The key of the tag.

          

        
        - **TagValue** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value of the tag.

When you create a CMK in a `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ , AWS KMS creates the key material for the CMK in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. This value is present only when the CMK is created in a custom key store.

            
          

          - **ExpirationModel** *(string) --* 

            Specifies whether the CMK's key material expires. This value is present only when ``Origin`` is ``EXTERNAL`` , otherwise this value is omitted.

            
          

          - **KeyManager** *(string) --* 

            The manager of the CMK. CMKs in your AWS account are either customer managed or AWS managed. For more information about the difference, see `Customer Master Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

            * ``MultiRegionKeyType`` indicates whether the CMK is a ``PRIMARY`` or ``REPLICA`` key. 
             
            * ``PrimaryKey`` displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key. This field displays the current CMK if it is the primary key. 
             
            * ``ReplicaKeys`` displays the key ARNs and Regions of all replica keys. This field includes the current CMK if it is a replica key. 
             

            
            

            - **MultiRegionKeyType** *(string) --* 

              Indicates whether the CMK is a ``PRIMARY`` or ``REPLICA`` key.

              
            

            - **PrimaryKey** *(dict) --* 

              Displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key. This field includes the current CMK if it is the primary key.

              
              

              - **Arn** *(string) --* 

                Displays the key ARN of a primary or replica key of a multi-Region key.

                
              

              - **Region** *(string) --* 

                Displays the AWS Region of a primary or replica key in a multi-Region key.

                
          
            

            - **ReplicaKeys** *(list) --* 

              displays the key ARNs and Regions of all replica keys. This field includes the current CMK if it is a replica key.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Describes the primary or replica key in a multi-Region key.

                  Displays the key ARN of a primary or replica key of a multi-Region key.

                  
                

                - **Region** *(string) --* 

                  Displays the AWS Region of a primary or replica key in a multi-Region key.

                  
            
          
        
          

          - **PendingDeletionWindowInDays** *(integer) --* 

            The waiting period before the primary key in a multi-Region key is deleted. This waiting period begins when the last of its replica keys is deleted. This value is present only when the ``KeyState`` of the CMK is ``PendingReplicaDeletion`` . That indicates that the CMK is the primary key in a multi-Region key, it is scheduled for deletion, and it still has existing replica keys.

             

            When a regional CMK or a replica key in a multi-Region key is scheduled for deletion, its deletion date is displayed in the ``DeletionDate`` field. However, when the primary key in a multi-Region key is scheduled for deletion, its waiting period doesn't begin until all of its replica keys are deleted. This value displays that waiting period. When the last replica key in the multi-Region key is deleted, the ``KeyState`` of the scheduled primary key changes from ``PendingReplicaDeletion`` to ``PendingDeletion`` and the deletion date appears in the ``DeletionDate`` field.

            
      
        

        - **ReplicaPolicy** *(string) --* 

          The key policy of the new replica key. The value is a key policy document in JSON format.

          
        

        - **ReplicaTags** *(list) --* 

          The tags on the new replica key. The value is a list of tag key and tag value pairs.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A key-value pair. A tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Tag keys and tag values are both required, but tag values can be empty (null) strings.

             

            For information about the rules that apply to tag keys and tag values, see `User-Defined Tag Restrictions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation-tag-restrictions.html>`__ in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide* .

            
            

            - **TagKey** *(string) --* 

              The key of the tag.

              
            

            - **TagValue** *(string) --* 

              The value of the tag.

  .. py:method:: retire_grant(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes a grant. Typically, you retire a grant when you no longer need its permissions. To identify the grant to retire, use a `grant token <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html#grant_token>`__ , or both the grant ID and a key identifier (key ID or key ARN) of the customer master key (CMK). The  CreateGrant operation returns both values.

     

    This operation can be called by the *retiring principal* for a grant, by the *grantee principal* if the grant allows the ``RetireGrant`` operation, and by the AWS account (root user) in which the grant is created. It can also be called by principals to whom permission for retiring a grant is delegated. For details, see `Retiring and revoking grants <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grant-manage.html#grant-delete>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see `Using grants <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html>`__ in the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* * . For examples of working with grants in several programming languages, see `Programming grants <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/programming-grants.html>`__ .

     

     **Cross-account use** : Yes. You can retire a grant on a CMK in a different AWS account.

     

     **Required permissions:** :Permission to retire a grant is determined primarily by the grant. For details, see `Retiring and revoking grants <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grant-manage.html#grant-delete>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

  .. py:method:: schedule_key_deletion(**kwargs)

    

    Schedules the deletion of a customer master key (CMK). By default, AWS KMS applies a waiting period of 30 days, but you can specify a waiting period of 7-30 days. When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes to ``PendingDeletion`` and the key can't be used in any cryptographic operations. It remains in this state for the duration of the waiting period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use  CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the CMK. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK, its key material, and all AWS KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is unrecoverable. (The only exception is a multi-Region replica key.) To prevent the use of a CMK without deleting it, use  DisableKey . 

       

     

    If you schedule deletion of a CMK from a `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ , when the waiting period expires, ``ScheduleKeyDeletion`` deletes the CMK from AWS KMS. Then AWS KMS makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually `delete the orphaned key material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key>`__ from the cluster and its backups.

     

    You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its replica keys at any time. However, AWS KMS will not delete a multi-Region primary key with existing replica keys. If you schedule the deletion of a primary key with replicas, its key state changes to ``PendingReplicaDeletion`` and it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic operations. This status can continue indefinitely. When the last of its replicas keys is deleted (not just scheduled), the key state of the primary key changes to ``PendingDeletion`` and its waiting period (``PendingWindowInDays`` ) begins. For details, see `Deleting multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-delete.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . 

     

    For more information about scheduling a CMK for deletion, see `Deleting Customer Master Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account.

  .. py:method:: sign(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a `digital signature <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature>`__ for a message or message digest by using the private key in an asymmetric CMK. To verify the signature, use the  Verify operation, or use the public key in the same asymmetric CMK outside of AWS KMS. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see `Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair, such as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric customer master key (CMK). The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key to sign a message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the message was signed with that particular private key and that the message hasn't changed since it was signed. 

     

    To use the ``Sign`` operation, provide the following information:

     

     
    * Use the ``KeyId`` parameter to identify an asymmetric CMK with a ``KeyUsage`` value of ``SIGN_VERIFY`` . To get the ``KeyUsage`` value of a CMK, use the  DescribeKey operation. The caller must have ``kms:Sign`` permission on the CMK. 
     
    * Use the ``Message`` parameter to specify the message or message digest to sign. You can submit messages of up to 4096 bytes. To sign a larger message, generate a hash digest of the message, and then provide the hash digest in the ``Message`` parameter. To indicate whether the message is a full message or a digest, use the ``MessageType`` parameter. 
     
    * Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the CMK.  
     

     

    .. warning::

       

      When signing a message, be sure to record the CMK and the signing algorithm. This information is required to verify the signature.

       

     

    To verify the signature that this operation generates, use the  Verify operation. Or use the  GetPublicKey operation to download the public key and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of AWS KMS. 

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : Yes. To perform this operation with a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the ``KeyId`` parameter.

      To specify a CMK, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with ``"alias/"`` . To specify a CMK in a different AWS account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

       

      For example:

    :param Message: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the message or message digest to sign. Messages can be 0-4096 bytes. To sign a larger message, provide the message digest.

       

      If you provide a message, AWS KMS generates a hash digest of the message and then signs it.

      

    
    :type MessageType: string
    :param MessageType: 

      Tells AWS KMS whether the value of the ``Message`` parameter is a message or message digest. The default value, RAW, indicates a message. To indicate a message digest, enter ``DIGEST`` .

      

    
    :type GrantTokens: list

  .. py:method:: update_alias(**kwargs)

    

    Associates an existing AWS KMS alias with a different customer master key (CMK). Each alias is associated with only one CMK at a time, although a CMK can have multiple aliases. The alias and the CMK must be in the same AWS account and Region.

     

    .. note::

       

      Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the CMK. For details, see `Using ABAC in AWS KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

       

     

    The current and new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric), and they must have the same key usage (``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`` or ``SIGN_VERIFY`` ). This restriction prevents errors in code that uses aliases. If you must assign an alias to a different type of CMK, use  DeleteAlias to delete the old alias and  CreateAlias to create a new alias.

     

    You cannot use ``UpdateAlias`` to change an alias name. To change an alias name, use  DeleteAlias to delete the old alias and  CreateAlias to create a new alias.

     

    Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can create, update, and delete the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the  DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs in the account, use the  ListAliases operation. 

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account.

    :param AliasName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Identifies the alias that is changing its CMK. This value must begin with ``alias/`` followed by the alias name, such as ``alias/ExampleAlias`` . You cannot use UpdateAlias to change the alias name.

      

    
    :type TargetKeyId: string
    :param TargetKeyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Identifies the `customer managed CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk>`__ to associate with the alias. You don't have permission to associate an alias with an `AWS managed CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk>`__ .

       

      The CMK must be in the same AWS account and Region as the alias. Also, the new target CMK must be the same type as the current target CMK (both symmetric or both asymmetric) and they must have the same key usage. 

       

      Specify the key ID or key ARN of the CMK.

       

      For example:

          # The alias to update.
          AliasName='alias/ExampleAlias',
          # The identifier of the CMK that the alias will refer to after this operation succeeds. You can use the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK.

  .. py:method:: update_custom_key_store(**kwargs)

    

    Changes the properties of a custom key store. Use the ``CustomKeyStoreId`` parameter to identify the custom key store you want to edit. Use the remaining parameters to change the properties of the custom key store.

     

    You can only update a custom key store that is disconnected. To disconnect the custom key store, use  DisconnectCustomKeyStore . To reconnect the custom key store after the update completes, use  ConnectCustomKeyStore . To find the connection state of a custom key store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

     

    Use the parameters of ``UpdateCustomKeyStore`` to edit your keystore settings.

     

     
    * Use the **NewCustomKeyStoreName** parameter to change the friendly name of the custom key store to the value that you specify.   
     
    * Use the **KeyStorePassword** parameter tell AWS KMS the current password of the ` ``kmsuser`` crypto user (CU) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser>`__ in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. You can use this parameter to `fix connection failures <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-password>`__ that occur when AWS KMS cannot log into the associated cluster because the ``kmsuser`` password has changed. This value does not change the password in the AWS CloudHSM cluster.   
     
    * Use the **CloudHsmClusterId** parameter to associate the custom key store with a different, but related, AWS CloudHSM cluster. You can use this parameter to repair a custom key store if its AWS CloudHSM cluster becomes corrupted or is deleted, or when you need to create or restore a cluster from a backup.  
     

     

    If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.

     

    This operation is part of the `Custom Key Store feature <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__ feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

      }

    

  .. py:method:: update_primary_region(**kwargs)

    

    Changes the primary key of a multi-Region key. 

     

    This operation changes the replica key in the specified Region to a primary key and changes the former primary key to a replica key. For example, suppose you have a primary key in ``us-east-1`` and a replica key in ``eu-west-2`` . If you run ``UpdatePrimaryRegion`` with a ``PrimaryRegion`` value of ``eu-west-2`` , the primary key is now the key in ``eu-west-2`` , and the key in ``us-east-1`` becomes a replica key. For details, see 

     

    This operation supports *multi-Region keys* , an AWS KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable CMKs in different AWS Regions. Because these CMKs have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them to encrypt data in one AWS Region and decrypt it in a different AWS Region without making a cross-Region call or exposing the plaintext data. For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Using multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    The *primary key* of a multi-Region key is the source for properties that are always shared by primary and replica keys, including the key material, `key ID <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-id>`__ , `key spec <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-spec>`__ , `key usage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-usage>`__ , `key material origin <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-origin>`__ , and `automatic key rotation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html>`__ . It's the only key that can be replicated. You cannot `delete the primary key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ScheduleKeyDeletion.html>`__ until all replicas are deleted.

     

    The key ID and primary Region that you specify uniquely identify the replica key that will become the primary key. The primary Region must already have a replica key. This operation does not create a CMK in the specified Region. To find the replica keys, use the  DescribeKey operation on the primary key or any replica key. To create a replica key, use the  ReplicateKey operation.

     

    You can run this operation while using the affected multi-Region keys in cryptographic operations. This operation should not delay, interrupt, or cause failures in cryptographic operations. 

     

    Even after this operation completes, the process of updating the primary Region might still be in progress for a few more seconds. Operations such as ``DescribeKey`` might display both the old and new primary keys as replicas. The old and new primary keys have a transient key state of ``Updating`` . The original key state is restored when the update is complete. While the key state is ``Updating`` , you can use the keys in cryptographic operations, but you cannot replicate the new primary key or perform certain management operations, such as enabling or disabling these keys. For details about the ``Updating`` key state, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    This operation does not return any output. To verify that primary key is changed, use the  DescribeKey operation.

     

     **Cross-account use** : No. You cannot use this operation in a different AWS account. 

     

     **Required permissions** : 

     

     
    * ``kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion`` on the current primary CMK (in the primary CMK's Region). Include this permission primary CMK's key policy. 
     
    * ``kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion`` on the current replica CMK (in the replica CMK's Region). Include this permission in the replica CMK's key policy.

      To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey .

      

    
    :type PrimaryRegion: string
    :param PrimaryRegion: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The AWS Region of the new primary key. Enter the Region ID, such as ``us-east-1`` or ``ap-southeast-2`` . There must be an existing replica key in this Region. 

       

      When the operation completes, the multi-Region key in this Region will be the primary key.

  .. py:method:: verify(**kwargs)

    

    Verifies a digital signature that was generated by the  Sign operation. 

     

    

     

    Verification confirms that an authorized user signed the message with the specified CMK and signing algorithm, and the message hasn't changed since it was signed. If the signature is verified, the value of the ``SignatureValid`` field in the response is ``True`` . If the signature verification fails, the ``Verify`` operation fails with an ``KMSInvalidSignatureException`` exception.

     

    A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric CMK. The signature is verified by using the public key in the same asymmetric CMK. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see `Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    To verify a digital signature, you can use the ``Verify`` operation. Specify the same asymmetric CMK, message, and signing algorithm that were used to produce the signature.

     

    You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the CMK outside of AWS KMS. Use the  GetPublicKey operation to download the public key in the asymmetric CMK and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of AWS KMS. The advantage of using the ``Verify`` operation is that it is performed within AWS KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is performed within the FIPS boundary, it is logged in AWS CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the CMK to verify signatures.

     

    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key state\: Effect on your CMK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

     **Cross-account use** : Yes. To perform this operation with a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the ``KeyId`` parameter. 

     

     **Required permissions** : `kms\:Verify <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ (key policy)

      )
    :type KeyId: string
    :param KeyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Identifies the asymmetric CMK that will be used to verify the signature. This must be the same CMK that was used to generate the signature. If you specify a different CMK, the signature verification fails.

       

      To specify a CMK, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with ``"alias/"`` . To specify a CMK in a different AWS account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

       

      For example:

       

       
      * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
       
      * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
       
      * Alias name: ``alias/ExampleAlias``   
       
      * Alias ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias``   
       

       

      To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases .

      

    
    :type Message: bytes
    :param Message: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the message that was signed. You can submit a raw message of up to 4096 bytes, or a hash digest of the message. If you submit a digest, use the ``MessageType`` parameter with a value of ``DIGEST`` .

       

      If the message specified here is different from the message that was signed, the signature verification fails. A message and its hash digest are considered to be the same message.

      

    
    :type MessageType: string
    :param MessageType: 

      Tells AWS KMS whether the value of the ``Message`` parameter is a message or message digest. The default value, RAW, indicates a message. To indicate a message digest, enter ``DIGEST`` .

       

      .. warning::

         

        Use the ``DIGEST`` value only when the value of the ``Message`` parameter is a message digest. If you use the ``DIGEST`` value with a raw message, the security of the verification operation can be compromised.

         

      

    
    :type Signature: bytes
    :param Signature: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The signature that the ``Sign`` operation generated.

      

    
    :type SigningAlgorithm: string
    :param SigningAlgorithm: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The signing algorithm that was used to sign the message. If you submit a different algorithm, the signature verification fails.

      

    
    :type GrantTokens: list
    :param GrantTokens: 

      A list of grant tokens.

       

      Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes from a new grant that has not yet achieved *eventual consistency* . For more information, see `Grant token <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#grant_token>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .
