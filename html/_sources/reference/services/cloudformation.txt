.. py:class:: CloudFormation.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS CloudFormation
   

  AWS CloudFormation allows you to create and manage AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use AWS CloudFormation to leverage AWS products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure.

   

  With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you.

   

  For more information about AWS CloudFormation, see the `AWS CloudFormation Product Page <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/>`__ .

   

  Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can find the product's technical documentation at `docs.aws.amazon.com <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/>`__ .

  .. py:method:: continue_update_rollback(**kwargs)

    

    For a specified stack that is in the ``UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED`` state, continues rolling it back to the ``UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`` state. Depending on the cause of the failure, you can manually `fix the error <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-failed>`__ and continue the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can return your stack to a working state (the ``UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`` state), and then try to update the stack again.

     

    A stack goes into the ``UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED`` state when AWS CloudFormation cannot roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, you might have a stack that is rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of AWS CloudFormation. Because AWS CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.

      .. note::

         

        Don't specify the name of a nested stack (a stack that was created by using the ``AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`` resource). Instead, use this operation on the parent stack (the stack that contains the ``AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`` resource).

         

      

    
    :type RoleARN: string
    :param RoleARN: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to roll back the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

       

      If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

      

    
    :type ResourcesToSkip: list
    :param ResourcesToSkip: 

      A list of the logical IDs of the resources that AWS CloudFormation skips during the continue update rollback operation. You can specify only resources that are in the ``UPDATE_FAILED`` state because a rollback failed. You can't specify resources that are in the ``UPDATE_FAILED`` state for other reasons, for example, because an update was cancelled. To check why a resource update failed, use the  DescribeStackResources action, and view the resource status reason. 

       

      .. warning::

         

        Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that AWS CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you `troubleshoot <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-failed>`__ resources before skipping them. AWS CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to ``UPDATE_COMPLETE`` and continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack template. Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable. 

         

       

      Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources. 

       

      To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following format: ``NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID`` . If you want to specify the logical ID of a stack resource (``Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`` ) in the ``ResourcesToSkip`` list, then its corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states: ``DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`` , ``DELETE_COMPLETE`` , or ``DELETE_FAILED`` . 

       

      .. note::

         

        Don't confuse a child stack's name with its corresponding logical ID defined in the parent stack. For an example of a continue update rollback operation with nested stacks, see `Using ResourcesToSkip to recover a nested stacks hierarchy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-continueupdaterollback.html#nested-stacks>`__ .

  .. py:method:: create_change_set(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set shows all of the resources that AWS CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set for an existing stack, AWS CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which resources AWS CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack.

     

    To create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, for the ``ChangeSetType`` parameter, specify ``CREATE`` . To create a change set for an existing stack, specify ``UPDATE`` for the ``ChangeSetType`` parameter. To create a change set for an import operation, specify ``IMPORT`` for the ``ChangeSetType`` parameter. After the ``CreateChangeSet`` call successfully completes, AWS CloudFormation starts creating the change set. To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the  DescribeChangeSet action.

     

    When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make, execute the change set by using the  ExecuteChangeSet action. AWS CloudFormation doesn't make changes until you execute the change set.

     

    To create a change set for the entire stack hierachy, set ``IncludeNestedStacks`` to ``True`` .

          The input value associated with the parameter.

          

        
        - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

          During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

    :type Capabilities: list
    :param Capabilities: 

      In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to create the stack.

       

       
      * ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` and ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM``   Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` or ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` capability. 

         
        * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.  
         
        * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` .  
         
        * If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an ``InsufficientCapabilities`` error. 
         

       

      If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

      * ``CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND``   Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the `AWS\:\:Include <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html>`__ and `AWS\:\:Serverless <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html>`__ transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. 

      .. note::

         This capacity does not apply to creating change sets, and specifying it when creating change sets has no effect. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros *and* nested stacks, you must create or update the stack directly from the template using the  CreateStack or  UpdateStack action, and specifying this capability. 

       For more information on macros, see `Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html>`__ .

      If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource type that you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for condition keys in IAM policies for AWS CloudFormation.

      - **RollbackTriggers** *(list) --* 

        The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions. 

         

        By default, AWS CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

         

         
        * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter. 
         
        * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack. 
         
        * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter. 
         

         

        If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back.

          A rollback trigger AWS CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation. 

          

        
          - **Arn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

             

            If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

            

          
          - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cw-alarm.html>`__ is the only supported resource type.

            

          
        
    
      - **MonitoringTimeInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

         

        The default is 0 minutes.

         

        If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using `CancelUpdateStack <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html>`__ , for example) as necessary.

         

        If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

        

      
    
    :type NotificationARNs: list
    :param NotificationARNs: 

      The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics that AWS CloudFormation associates with the stack. To remove all associated notification topics, specify an empty list.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum of 50 tags.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an AWS CloudFormation stack.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (AWS) have the reserved prefix: ``aws:`` .

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

          

        
      
  
    :type ChangeSetName: string
    :param ChangeSetName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the change set. The name must be unique among all change sets that are associated with the specified stack.

       

      A change set name can contain only alphanumeric, case sensitive characters and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and cannot exceed 128 characters.

      

    
    :type ClientToken: string
    :param ClientToken: 

      A unique identifier for this ``CreateChangeSet`` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create another change set with the same name. You might retry ``CreateChangeSet`` requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

      

    
    :type Description: string
    :param Description: 

      A description to help you identify this change set.

      

    
    :type ChangeSetType: string
    :param ChangeSetType: 

      The type of change set operation. To create a change set for a new stack, specify ``CREATE`` . To create a change set for an existing stack, specify ``UPDATE`` . To create a change set for an import operation, specify ``IMPORT`` .

       

      If you create a change set for a new stack, AWS Cloudformation creates a stack with a unique stack ID, but no template or resources. The stack will be in the ` ``REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS`` https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-describing-stacks.html#d0e11995`__ state until you execute the change set.

       

      By default, AWS CloudFormation specifies ``UPDATE`` . You can't use the ``UPDATE`` type to create a change set for a new stack or the ``CREATE`` type to create a change set for an existing stack.

      

    
    :type ResourcesToImport: list
    :param ResourcesToImport: 

      The resources to import into your stack.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Describes the target resource of an import operation.

        

      
        - **ResourceType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The type of resource to import into your stack, such as ``AWS::S3::Bucket`` . For a list of supported resource types, see `Resources that support import operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import-supported-resources.html>`__ in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

          

        
        - **LogicalResourceId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The logical ID of the target resource as specified in the template.

          

        
        - **ResourceIdentifier** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A key-value pair that identifies the target resource. The key is an identifier property (for example, ``BucketName`` for ``AWS::S3::Bucket`` resources) and the value is the actual property value (for example, ``MyS3Bucket`` ).

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
      
    
      
  
    :type IncludeNestedStacks: boolean
    :param IncludeNestedStacks: 

      Creates a change set for the all nested stacks specified in the template. The default behavior of this action is set to ``False`` . To include nested sets in a change set, specify ``True`` .

    :type StackName: string
    :param StackName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name that is associated with the stack. The name must be unique in the Region in which you are creating the stack.

       

      .. note::

         

        A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and cannot be longer than 128 characters.

         

      

    
    :type TemplateBody: string
    :param TemplateBody: 

      Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, go to `Template Anatomy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html>`__ in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

       

      Conditional: You must specify either the ``TemplateBody`` or the ``TemplateURL`` parameter, but not both.

      

    
    :type TemplateURL: string
    :param TemplateURL: 

      Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Manager document. For more information, go to the `Template Anatomy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html>`__ in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

       

      Conditional: You must specify either the ``TemplateBody`` or the ``TemplateURL`` parameter, but not both.

      

    
    :type Parameters: list
    :param Parameters: 

      A list of ``Parameter`` structures that specify input parameters for the stack. For more information, see the `Parameter <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html>`__ data type.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Parameter data type.

        

      
        - **ParameterKey** *(string) --* 

          The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

          

        
        - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

          The input value associated with the parameter.

          

        
        - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

          During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

          

        
        - **ResolvedValue** *(string) --* 

          Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

          

        
      
  
    :type DisableRollback: boolean
    :param DisableRollback: 

      Set to ``true`` to disable rollback of the stack if stack creation failed. You can specify either ``DisableRollback`` or ``OnFailure`` , but not both.

       

      Default: ``false``  

      

    
    :type RollbackConfiguration: dict
    :param RollbackConfiguration: 

      The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

      

    
      - **RollbackTriggers** *(list) --* 

        The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions. 

         

        By default, AWS CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

         

         
        * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter. 
         
        * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack. 
         
        * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter. 
         

         

        If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A rollback trigger AWS CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation. 

          

        
          - **Arn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

             

            If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

            

          
          - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cw-alarm.html>`__ is the only supported resource type.

            

          
        
    
      - **MonitoringTimeInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

         

        The default is 0 minutes.

         

        If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using `CancelUpdateStack <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html>`__ , for example) as necessary.

         

        If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

        

      
    
    :type TimeoutInMinutes: integer
    :param TimeoutInMinutes: 

      The amount of time that can pass before the stack status becomes CREATE_FAILED; if ``DisableRollback`` is not set or is set to ``false`` , the stack will be rolled back.

      

    
    :type NotificationARNs: list
    :param NotificationARNs: 

      The Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic ARNs to publish stack related events. You can find your SNS topic ARNs using the SNS console or your Command Line Interface (CLI).

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Capabilities: list
    :param Capabilities: 

      In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to create the stack.

       

       
      * ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` and ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM``   Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` or ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` capability. 

         
        * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.  
         
        * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` .  
         
        * If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an ``InsufficientCapabilities`` error. 
         

       

      If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

      For more information, see `Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS CloudFormation Templates <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html#capabilities>`__ .

       
       
      * ``CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND``   Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the `AWS\:\:Include <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html>`__ and `AWS\:\:Serverless <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html>`__ transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros *and* nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability. 

      .. warning::

         You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being notified. 

       For more information, see `Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html>`__ . 
       

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ResourceTypes: list
    :param ResourceTypes: 

      The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for this create stack action, such as ``AWS::EC2::Instance`` , ``AWS::EC2::*`` , or ``Custom::MyCustomInstance`` . Use the following syntax to describe template resource types: ``AWS::*`` (for all AWS resource), ``Custom::*`` (for all custom resources), ``Custom::*logical_ID* `` (for a specific custom resource), ``AWS::*service_name* ::*`` (for all resources of a particular AWS service), and ``AWS::*service_name* ::*resource_logical_ID* `` (for a specific AWS resource).

       

      If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're creating, the stack creation fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for AWS CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see `Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html>`__ .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type RoleARN: string
    :param RoleARN: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to create the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

       

      If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

      

    
    :type OnFailure: string
    :param OnFailure: 

      Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. This must be one of: DO_NOTHING, ROLLBACK, or DELETE. You can specify either ``OnFailure`` or ``DisableRollback`` , but not both.

       

      Default: ``ROLLBACK``  

      

    
    :type StackPolicyBody: string
    :param StackPolicyBody: 

      Structure containing the stack policy body. For more information, go to `Prevent Updates to Stack Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* . You can specify either the ``StackPolicyBody`` or the ``StackPolicyURL`` parameter, but not both.

      

    
    :type StackPolicyURL: string
    :param StackPolicyURL: 

      Location of a file containing the stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (maximum size: 16 KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the ``StackPolicyBody`` or the ``StackPolicyURL`` parameter, but not both.

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to the resources created in the stack. A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an AWS CloudFormation stack.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (AWS) have the reserved prefix: ``aws:`` .

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

          

        
      
  
    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      A unique identifier for this ``CreateStack`` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create a stack with the same name. You might retry ``CreateStack`` requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

       

      All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a ``CreateStack`` operation with the token ``token1`` , then all the ``StackEvents`` generated by that operation will have ``ClientRequestToken`` set as ``token1`` .

       

      In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID* , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: ``Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`` . 

      

    
    :type EnableTerminationProtection: boolean
    :param EnableTerminationProtection: 

      Whether to enable termination protection on the specified stack. If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the operation fails and the stack remains unchanged. For more information, see `Protecting a Stack From Being Deleted <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* . Termination protection is disabled on stacks by default. 

       

      For `nested stacks <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html>`__ , termination protection is set on the root stack and cannot be changed directly on the nested stack.

      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ParameterOverrides: list
    :param ParameterOverrides: 

      A list of stack set parameters whose values you want to override in the selected stack instances.

       

      Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how AWS CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance operations:

       

       
      * To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter and specify its value. 
       
      * To leave a parameter set to its present value, you can do one of the following: 

         
        * Do not include the parameter in the list. 
         
        * Include the parameter and specify ``UsePreviousValue`` as ``true`` . (You cannot specify both a value and set ``UsePreviousValue`` to ``true`` .) 
         

       
       
      * To set all overridden parameter back to the values specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but do not include any parameters. 
       
      * To leave all parameters set to their present values, do not specify this property at all. 
       

       

      During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden value.

       

      You can only override the parameter *values* that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use `UpdateStackSet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStackSet.html>`__ to update the stack set template.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Parameter data type.

        

      
        - **ParameterKey** *(string) --* 

          The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

          

        
        - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

          The input value associated with the parameter.

          

        
        - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

          During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

          

        
        - **ResolvedValue** *(string) --* 

          Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

          

        
      
  
    :type OperationPreferences: dict
    :param OperationPreferences: 

      Preferences for how AWS CloudFormation performs this stack set operation.

      

    
      - **RegionConcurrencyType** *(string) --* 

        The concurrency type of deploying StackSets operations in regions, could be in parallel or one region at a time.

        

      
      - **RegionOrder** *(list) --* 

        The order of the Regions in where you want to perform the stack operation.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **FailureToleranceCount** *(integer) --* 

        The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``FailureToleranceCount`` or ``FailureTolerancePercentage`` (but not both).

         

        By default, ``0`` is specified.

        

      
      - **FailureTolerancePercentage** *(integer) --* 

        The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

         

        When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds *down* to the next whole number.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``FailureToleranceCount`` or ``FailureTolerancePercentage`` , but not both.

         

        By default, ``0`` is specified.

        

      
      - **MaxConcurrentCount** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This is dependent on the value of ``FailureToleranceCount`` . ``MaxConcurrentCount`` is at most one more than the ``FailureToleranceCount`` .

         

        Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``MaxConcurrentCount`` or ``MaxConcurrentPercentage`` , but not both.

         

        By default, ``1`` is specified.

        

      
      - **MaxConcurrentPercentage** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time.

         

        When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number. This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number as one instead.

         

        Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``MaxConcurrentCount`` or ``MaxConcurrentPercentage`` , but not both.

         

        By default, ``1`` is specified.

        

      
    
    :type OperationId: string
    :param OperationId: 

      The unique identifier for this stack set operation. 

       

      The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that AWS CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack set operation requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

       

      If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically. 

       

      Repeating this stack set operation with a new operation ID retries all stack instances whose status is ``OUTDATED`` . 

      This field is autopopulated if not provided.

    
    :type CallAs: string
    :param CallAs: 

      [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.

       

      By default, ``SELF`` is specified. Use ``SELF`` for stack sets with self-managed permissions.

       

       
      * If you are signed in to the management account, specify ``SELF`` . 
       
      * If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify ``DELEGATED_ADMIN`` . Your AWS account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see `Register a delegated administrator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* .

      In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack set template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to create the stack set and related stack instances.

       

       
      * ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` and ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM``   Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stack sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` or ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` capability. 

         
        * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.  
         
        * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` .  
         
        * If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an ``InsufficientCapabilities`` error. 
         

       

      If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

         Stack sets with service-managed permissions do not currently support the use of macros in templates. (This includes the `AWS\:\:Include <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html>`__ and `AWS\:\:Serverless <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html>`__ transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability for a stack set with service-managed permissions, if you reference a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail. 

       
       

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the stacks created from it. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources that are created in the stacks. A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified.

       

      If you specify tags as part of a ``CreateStackSet`` action, AWS CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission to tag resources. If you don't, the entire ``CreateStackSet`` action fails with an ``access denied`` error, and the stack set is not created.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an AWS CloudFormation stack.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (AWS) have the reserved prefix: ``aws:`` .

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

          

        
      
  
    :type AdministrationRoleARN: string
    :param AdministrationRoleARN: 

      The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the IAM role to use to create this stack set. 

       

      Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized administrator roles to control which users or groups can manage specific stack sets within the same administrator account. For more information, see `Prerequisites\: Granting Permissions for Stack Set Operations <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* .

      

    
    :type ExecutionRoleName: string
    :param ExecutionRoleName: 

      The name of the IAM execution role to use to create the stack set. If you do not specify an execution role, AWS CloudFormation uses the ``AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole`` role for the stack set operation.

       

      Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized execution roles to control which stack resources users and groups can include in their stack sets. 

      

    
    :type PermissionModel: string
    :param PermissionModel: 

      Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations are created. By default, ``SELF-MANAGED`` is specified.

       

       
      * With ``self-managed`` permissions, you must create the administrator and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For more information, see `Grant Self-Managed Stack Set Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.html>`__ . 
       
      * With ``service-managed`` permissions, StackSets automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by AWS Organizations. For more information, see `Grant Service-Managed Stack Set Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs-service-managed.html>`__ . 
       

      

    
    :type AutoDeployment: dict
    :param AutoDeployment: 

      Describes whether StackSets automatically deploys to AWS Organizations accounts that are added to the target organization or organizational unit (OU). Specify only if ``PermissionModel`` is ``SERVICE_MANAGED`` .

      

    
      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

        If set to ``true`` , StackSets automatically deploys additional stack instances to AWS Organizations accounts that are added to a target organization or organizational unit (OU) in the specified Regions. If an account is removed from a target organization or OU, StackSets deletes stack instances from the account in the specified Regions.

        

      
      - **RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval** *(boolean) --* 

        If set to ``true`` , stack resources are retained when an account is removed from a target organization or OU. If set to ``false`` , stack resources are deleted. Specify only if ``Enabled`` is set to ``True`` .

      [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.

       

      By default, ``SELF`` is specified. Use ``SELF`` for stack sets with self-managed permissions.

       

       
      * To create a stack set with service-managed permissions while signed in to the management account, specify ``SELF`` . 
       
      * To create a stack set with service-managed permissions while signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify ``DELEGATED_ADMIN`` . Your AWS account must be registered as a delegated admin in the management account. For more information, see `Register a delegated administrator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* . 
       

       

      Stack sets with service-managed permissions are created in the management account, including stack sets that are created by delegated administrators.

      

    
    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      A unique identifier for this ``CreateStackSet`` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create another stack set with the same name. You might retry ``CreateStackSet`` requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

       

      If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically.

    Deactivates a public extension that was previously activated in this account and region.

     

    Once deactivated, an extension cannot be used in any CloudFormation operation. This includes stack update operations where the stack template includes the extension, even if no updates are being made to the extension. In addition, deactivated extensions are not automatically updated if a new version of the extension is released.

  .. py:method:: delete_change_set(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the specified change set. Deleting change sets ensures that no one executes the wrong change set.

     

    If the call successfully completes, AWS CloudFormation successfully deleted the change set.

     

    If ``IncludeNestedStacks`` specifies ``True`` during the creation of the nested change set, then ``DeleteChangeSet`` will delete all change sets that belong to the stacks hierarchy and will also delete all change sets for nested stacks with the status of ``REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS`` .

      The name or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack.

      

    
    :type RetainResources: list
    :param RetainResources: 

      For stacks in the ``DELETE_FAILED`` state, a list of resource logical IDs that are associated with the resources you want to retain. During deletion, AWS CloudFormation deletes the stack but does not delete the retained resources.

       

      Retaining resources is useful when you cannot delete a resource, such as a non-empty S3 bucket, but you want to delete the stack.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type RoleARN: string
    :param RoleARN: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to delete the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.

       

      If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

      

    
    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      A unique identifier for this ``DeleteStack`` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to delete a stack with the same name. You might retry ``DeleteStack`` requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

       

      All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a ``CreateStack`` operation with the token ``token1`` , then all the ``StackEvents`` generated by that operation will have ``ClientRequestToken`` set as ``token1`` .

       

      In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID* , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: ``Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`` .

        The order of the Regions in where you want to perform the stack operation.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **FailureToleranceCount** *(integer) --* 

        The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``FailureToleranceCount`` or ``FailureTolerancePercentage`` (but not both).

         

        By default, ``0`` is specified.

        

      
      - **FailureTolerancePercentage** *(integer) --* 

        The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

         

        When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds *down* to the next whole number.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``FailureToleranceCount`` or ``FailureTolerancePercentage`` , but not both.

         

        By default, ``0`` is specified.

        

      
      - **MaxConcurrentCount** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This is dependent on the value of ``FailureToleranceCount`` . ``MaxConcurrentCount`` is at most one more than the ``FailureToleranceCount`` .

         

        Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``MaxConcurrentCount`` or ``MaxConcurrentPercentage`` , but not both.

         

        By default, ``1`` is specified.

        

      
      - **MaxConcurrentPercentage** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time.

         

        When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number. This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number as one instead.

         

        Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``MaxConcurrentCount`` or ``MaxConcurrentPercentage`` , but not both.

    :param OperationId: 

      The unique identifier for this stack set operation. 

       

      If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically. 

       

      The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that AWS CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You can retry stack set operation requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

  .. py:method:: deregister_type(**kwargs)

    

    Marks an extension or extension version as ``DEPRECATED`` in the CloudFormation registry, removing it from active use. Deprecated extensions or extension versions cannot be used in CloudFormation operations.

     

    To deregister an entire extension, you must individually deregister all active versions of that extension. If an extension has only a single active version, deregistering that version results in the extension itself being deregistered and marked as deprecated in the registry. 

     

    You cannot deregister the default version of an extension if there are other active version of that extension. If you do deregister the default version of an extension, the textensionype itself is deregistered as well and marked as deprecated. 

     

    To view the deprecation status of an extension or extension version, use `DescribeType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html>`__ .

        - **Parameters** *(list) --* 

          A list of ``Parameter`` structures that describes the input parameters and their values used to create the change set. For more information, see the `Parameter <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html>`__ data type.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            The Parameter data type.

            
            

            - **ParameterKey** *(string) --* 

              The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

              
            

            - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

              The input value associated with the parameter.

              
            

            - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

              During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

              
            

            - **ResolvedValue** *(string) --* 

              Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

              
        
      
        

        - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The start time when the change set was created, in UTC.

          
        

        - **ExecutionStatus** *(string) --* 

          If the change set execution status is ``AVAILABLE`` , you can execute the change set. If you can’t execute the change set, the status indicates why. For example, a change set might be in an ``UNAVAILABLE`` state because AWS CloudFormation is still creating it or in an ``OBSOLETE`` state because the stack was already updated.

          
        

        - **Status** *(string) --* 

          The current status of the change set, such as ``CREATE_IN_PROGRESS`` , ``CREATE_COMPLETE`` , or ``FAILED`` .

          
        

        - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

          A description of the change set's status. For example, if your attempt to create a change set failed, AWS CloudFormation shows the error message.

          
        

        - **NotificationARNs** *(list) --* 

          The ARNs of the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics that will be associated with the stack if you execute the change set.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **RollbackConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

          The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

          
          

          - **RollbackTriggers** *(list) --* 

            The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions. 

             

            By default, AWS CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

             

             
            * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter. 
             
            * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack. 
             
            * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter. 
             

             

            If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A rollback trigger AWS CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation. 

              
              

              - **Arn** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

                 

                If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

                
              

              - **Type** *(string) --* 

                The resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cw-alarm.html>`__ is the only supported resource type.

                
          
        
          

          - **MonitoringTimeInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

            The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

             

            The default is 0 minutes.

             

            If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using `CancelUpdateStack <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html>`__ , for example) as necessary.

             

            If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

            
      
        

        - **Capabilities** *(list) --* 

          If you execute the change set, the list of capabilities that were explicitly acknowledged when the change set was created.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **Tags** *(list) --* 

          If you execute the change set, the tags that will be associated with the stack.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an AWS CloudFormation stack.

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

               *Required* . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (AWS) have the reserved prefix: ``aws:`` .

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

               *Required* . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

              
        
      
        

        - **Changes** *(list) --* 

          A list of ``Change`` structures that describes the resources AWS CloudFormation changes if you execute the change set.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            The ``Change`` structure describes the changes AWS CloudFormation will perform if you execute the change set.

            
            

            - **Type** *(string) --* 

              The type of entity that AWS CloudFormation changes. Currently, the only entity type is ``Resource`` .

              
            

            - **ResourceChange** *(dict) --* 

              A ``ResourceChange`` structure that describes the resource and action that AWS CloudFormation will perform.

              
              

              - **Action** *(string) --* 

                The action that AWS CloudFormation takes on the resource, such as ``Add`` (adds a new resource), ``Modify`` (changes a resource), ``Remove`` (deletes a resource), ``Import`` (imports a resource), or ``Dynamic`` (exact action for the resource cannot be determined).

                
              

              - **LogicalResourceId** *(string) --* 

                The resource's logical ID, which is defined in the stack's template.

                
              

              - **PhysicalResourceId** *(string) --* 

                The resource's physical ID (resource name). Resources that you are adding don't have physical IDs because they haven't been created.

                
              

              - **ResourceType** *(string) --* 

                The type of AWS CloudFormation resource, such as ``AWS::S3::Bucket`` .

                
              

              - **Replacement** *(string) --* 

                For the ``Modify`` action, indicates whether AWS CloudFormation will replace the resource by creating a new one and deleting the old one. This value depends on the value of the ``RequiresRecreation`` property in the ``ResourceTargetDefinition`` structure. For example, if the ``RequiresRecreation`` field is ``Always`` and the ``Evaluation`` field is ``Static`` , ``Replacement`` is ``True`` . If the ``RequiresRecreation`` field is ``Always`` and the ``Evaluation`` field is ``Dynamic`` , ``Replacement`` is ``Conditionally`` .

                 

                If you have multiple changes with different ``RequiresRecreation`` values, the ``Replacement`` value depends on the change with the most impact. A ``RequiresRecreation`` value of ``Always`` has the most impact, followed by ``Conditionally`` , and then ``Never`` .

                
              

              - **Scope** *(list) --* 

                For the ``Modify`` action, indicates which resource attribute is triggering this update, such as a change in the resource attribute's ``Metadata`` , ``Properties`` , or ``Tags`` .

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **Details** *(list) --* 

                For the ``Modify`` action, a list of ``ResourceChangeDetail`` structures that describes the changes that AWS CloudFormation will make to the resource. 

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  For a resource with ``Modify`` as the action, the ``ResourceChange`` structure describes the changes AWS CloudFormation will make to that resource.

                  
                  

                  - **Target** *(dict) --* 

                    A ``ResourceTargetDefinition`` structure that describes the field that AWS CloudFormation will change and whether the resource will be recreated.

                    
                    

                    - **Attribute** *(string) --* 

                      Indicates which resource attribute is triggering this update, such as a change in the resource attribute's ``Metadata`` , ``Properties`` , or ``Tags`` .

                      
                    

                    - **Name** *(string) --* 

                      If the ``Attribute`` value is ``Properties`` , the name of the property. For all other attributes, the value is null.

                      
                    

                    - **RequiresRecreation** *(string) --* 

                      If the ``Attribute`` value is ``Properties`` , indicates whether a change to this property causes the resource to be recreated. The value can be ``Never`` , ``Always`` , or ``Conditionally`` . To determine the conditions for a ``Conditionally`` recreation, see the update behavior for that `property <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html>`__ in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

                      
                
                  

                  - **Evaluation** *(string) --* 

                    Indicates whether AWS CloudFormation can determine the target value, and whether the target value will change before you execute a change set.

                     

                    For ``Static`` evaluations, AWS CloudFormation can determine that the target value will change, and its value. For example, if you directly modify the ``InstanceType`` property of an EC2 instance, AWS CloudFormation knows that this property value will change, and its value, so this is a ``Static`` evaluation.

                     

                    For ``Dynamic`` evaluations, cannot determine the target value because it depends on the result of an intrinsic function, such as a ``Ref`` or ``Fn::GetAtt`` intrinsic function, when the stack is updated. For example, if your template includes a reference to a resource that is conditionally recreated, the value of the reference (the physical ID of the resource) might change, depending on if the resource is recreated. If the resource is recreated, it will have a new physical ID, so all references to that resource will also be updated.

                    
                  

                  - **ChangeSource** *(string) --* 

                    The group to which the ``CausingEntity`` value belongs. There are five entity groups:

                     

                     
                    * ``ResourceReference`` entities are ``Ref`` intrinsic functions that refer to resources in the template, such as ``{ "Ref" : "MyEC2InstanceResource" }`` . 
                     
                    * ``ParameterReference`` entities are ``Ref`` intrinsic functions that get template parameter values, such as ``{ "Ref" : "MyPasswordParameter" }`` . 
                     
                    * ``ResourceAttribute`` entities are ``Fn::GetAtt`` intrinsic functions that get resource attribute values, such as ``{ "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "MyEC2InstanceResource", "PublicDnsName" ] }`` . 
                     
                    * ``DirectModification`` entities are changes that are made directly to the template. 
                     
                    * ``Automatic`` entities are ``AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`` resource types, which are also known as nested stacks. If you made no changes to the ``AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`` resource, AWS CloudFormation sets the ``ChangeSource`` to ``Automatic`` because the nested stack's template might have changed. Changes to a nested stack's template aren't visible to AWS CloudFormation until you run an update on the parent stack. 
                     

                    
                  

                  - **CausingEntity** *(string) --* 

                    The identity of the entity that triggered this change. This entity is a member of the group that is specified by the ``ChangeSource`` field. For example, if you modified the value of the ``KeyPairName`` parameter, the ``CausingEntity`` is the name of the parameter (``KeyPairName`` ).

                     

                    If the ``ChangeSource`` value is ``DirectModification`` , no value is given for ``CausingEntity`` .

                    
              
            
              

              - **ChangeSetId** *(string) --* 

                The change set ID of the nested change set.

                
              

              - **ModuleInfo** *(dict) --* 

                Contains information about the module from which the resource was created, if the resource was created from a module included in the stack template.

                
                

                - **TypeHierarchy** *(string) --* 

                  A concantenated list of the the module type or types containing the resource. Module types are listed starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated by ``/`` .

                   

                  In the following example, the resource was created from a module of type ``AWS::First::Example::MODULE`` , that is nested inside a parent module of type ``AWS::Second::Example::MODULE`` .

                   

                   ``AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MODULE``  

                  
                

                - **LogicalIdHierarchy** *(string) --* 

                  A concantenated list of the logical IDs of the module or modules containing the resource. Modules are listed starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated by ``/`` .

                   

                  In the following example, the resource was created from a module, ``moduleA`` , that is nested inside a parent module, ``moduleB`` .

                   

                   ``moduleA/moduleB``

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          If the output exceeds 1 MB, a string that identifies the next page of changes. If there is no additional page, this value is null.

          
        

        - **IncludeNestedStacks** *(boolean) --* 

          Verifies if ``IncludeNestedStacks`` is set to ``True`` .

          
        

        - **ParentChangeSetId** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the change set ID of the parent change set in the current nested change set hierarchy.

          
        

        - **RootChangeSetId** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the change set ID of the root change set in the current nested change set hierarchy.

  .. py:method:: describe_stack_drift_detection_status(**kwargs)

    

    Returns information about a stack drift detection operation. A stack drift detection operation detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has *drifted* , from it's expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources have drifted. For more information on stack and resource drift, see `Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html>`__ .

     

    Use  DetectStackDrift to initiate a stack drift detection operation. ``DetectStackDrift`` returns a ``StackDriftDetectionId`` you can use to monitor the progress of the operation using ``DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus`` . Once the drift detection operation has completed, use  DescribeStackResourceDrifts to return drift information about the stack and its resources.

            - **Timestamp** *(datetime) --* 

              Time the status was updated.

              The token passed to the operation that generated this event.

               

              All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a ``CreateStack`` operation with the token ``token1`` , then all the ``StackEvents`` generated by that operation will have ``ClientRequestToken`` set as ``token1`` .

               

              In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID* , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: ``Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`` . 

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          If the output exceeds 1 MB in size, a string that identifies the next page of events. If no additional page exists, this value is null.

  .. py:method:: describe_stack_resource_drifts(**kwargs)

    

    Returns drift information for the resources that have been checked for drift in the specified stack. This includes actual and expected configuration values for resources where AWS CloudFormation detects configuration drift.

     

    For a given stack, there will be one ``StackResourceDrift`` for each stack resource that has been checked for drift. Resources that have not yet been checked for drift are not included. Resources that do not currently support drift detection are not checked, and so not included. For a list of resources that support drift detection, see `Resources that Support Drift Detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift-resource-list.html>`__ .

     

    Use  DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on individual resources, or  DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all supported resources for a given stack.

  .. py:method:: describe_stack_resources(**kwargs)

    

    Returns AWS resource descriptions for running and deleted stacks. If ``StackName`` is specified, all the associated resources that are part of the stack are returned. If ``PhysicalResourceId`` is specified, the associated resources of the stack that the resource belongs to are returned.

     

    .. note::

       

      Only the first 100 resources will be returned. If your stack has more resources than this, you should use ``ListStackResources`` instead.

       

     

    For deleted stacks, ``DescribeStackResources`` returns resource information for up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted.

     

    You must specify either ``StackName`` or ``PhysicalResourceId`` , but not both. In addition, you can specify ``LogicalResourceId`` to filter the returned result. For more information about resources, the ``LogicalResourceId`` and ``PhysicalResourceId`` , go to the `AWS CloudFormation User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/>`__ .

     

    .. note::

       

      A ``ValidationError`` is returned if you specify both ``StackName`` and ``PhysicalResourceId`` in the same request.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **StackSetOperation** *(dict) --* 

          The specified stack set operation.

          
          

          - **OperationId** *(string) --* 

            The unique ID of a stack set operation.

            
          

          - **StackSetId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the stack set.

            
          

          - **Action** *(string) --* 

            The type of stack set operation: ``CREATE`` , ``UPDATE`` , or ``DELETE`` . Create and delete operations affect only the specified stack set instances that are associated with the specified stack set. Update operations affect both the stack set itself, as well as *all* associated stack set instances.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The status of the operation. 

             

             
            * ``FAILED`` : The operation exceeded the specified failure tolerance. The failure tolerance value that you've set for an operation is applied for each Region during stack create and update operations. If the number of failed stacks within a Region exceeds the failure tolerance, the status of the operation in the Region is set to ``FAILED`` . This in turn sets the status of the operation as a whole to ``FAILED`` , and AWS CloudFormation cancels the operation in any remaining Regions. 
             
            * ``QUEUED`` : [Service-managed permissions] For automatic deployments that require a sequence of operations, the operation is queued to be performed. For more information, see the `stack set operation status codes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html#stackset-status-codes>`__ in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. 
             
            * ``RUNNING`` : The operation is currently being performed. 
             
            * ``STOPPED`` : The user has cancelled the operation. 
             
            * ``STOPPING`` : The operation is in the process of stopping, at user request.  
             
            * ``SUCCEEDED`` : The operation completed creating or updating all the specified stacks without exceeding the failure tolerance for the operation. 
             

            
          

          - **OperationPreferences** *(dict) --* 

            The preferences for how AWS CloudFormation performs this stack set operation.

            
            

            - **RegionConcurrencyType** *(string) --* 

              The concurrency type of deploying StackSets operations in regions, could be in parallel or one region at a time.

              
            

            - **RegionOrder** *(list) --* 

              The order of the Regions in where you want to perform the stack operation.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
            

            - **FailureToleranceCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

               

              Conditional: You must specify either ``FailureToleranceCount`` or ``FailureTolerancePercentage`` (but not both).

               

              By default, ``0`` is specified.

              
            

            - **FailureTolerancePercentage** *(integer) --* 

              The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

               

              When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds *down* to the next whole number.

               

              Conditional: You must specify either ``FailureToleranceCount`` or ``FailureTolerancePercentage`` , but not both.

               

              By default, ``0`` is specified.

              
            

            - **MaxConcurrentCount** *(integer) --* 

              The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This is dependent on the value of ``FailureToleranceCount`` . ``MaxConcurrentCount`` is at most one more than the ``FailureToleranceCount`` .

               

              Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

               

              Conditional: You must specify either ``MaxConcurrentCount`` or ``MaxConcurrentPercentage`` , but not both.

               

              By default, ``1`` is specified.

              
            

            - **MaxConcurrentPercentage** *(integer) --* 

              The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time.

               

              When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number. This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number as one instead.

               

              Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

               

              Conditional: You must specify either ``MaxConcurrentCount`` or ``MaxConcurrentPercentage`` , but not both.

               

              By default, ``1`` is specified.

              
        
          

          - **RetainStacks** *(boolean) --* 

            For stack set operations of action type ``DELETE`` , specifies whether to remove the stack instances from the specified stack set, but doesn't delete the stacks. You can't reassociate a retained stack, or add an existing, saved stack to a new stack set.

            
          

          - **AdministrationRoleARN** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the IAM role used to perform this stack set operation. 

             

            Use customized administrator roles to control which users or groups can manage specific stack sets within the same administrator account. For more information, see `Define Permissions for Multiple Administrators <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* .

            
          

          - **ExecutionRoleName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the IAM execution role used to create or update the stack set.

             

            Use customized execution roles to control which stack resources users and groups can include in their stack sets. 

            
          

          - **CreationTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

            The time at which the operation was initiated. Note that the creation times for the stack set operation might differ from the creation time of the individual stacks themselves. This is because AWS CloudFormation needs to perform preparatory work for the operation, such as dispatching the work to the requested Regions, before actually creating the first stacks.

            
          

          - **EndTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

            The time at which the stack set operation ended, across all accounts and Regions specified. Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that the stack set operation was successful, or even attempted, in each account or Region.

            
          

          - **DeploymentTargets** *(dict) --* 

            [Service-managed permissions] The AWS Organizations accounts affected by the stack operation.

            - **AccountsUrl** *(string) --* 

              Returns the value of the AccountsUrl property.

              
            

            - **OrganizationalUnitIds** *(list) --* 

              The organization root ID or organizational unit (OU) IDs to which StackSets deploys.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
        
          

          - **StackSetDriftDetectionDetails** *(dict) --* 

            Detailed information about the drift status of the stack set. This includes information about drift operations currently being performed on the stack set.

             

            this information will only be present for stack set operations whose ``Action`` type is ``DETECT_DRIFT`` .

             

            For more information, see `Detecting Unmanaged Changes in Stack Sets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-drift.html>`__ in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

            
            

            - **DriftStatus** *(string) --* 

              Status of the stack set's actual configuration compared to its expected template and parameter configuration. A stack set is considered to have drifted if one or more of its stack instances have drifted from their expected template and parameter configuration.

               

               
              * ``DRIFTED`` : One or more of the stack instances belonging to the stack set stack differs from the expected template and parameter configuration. A stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associated stack have drifted. 
               
              * ``NOT_CHECKED`` : AWS CloudFormation has not checked the stack set for drift.

              * ``COMPLETED`` : The drift detection operation completed without failing on any stack instances. 
               
              * ``FAILED`` : The drift detection operation exceeded the specified failure tolerance.  
               
              * ``PARTIAL_SUCCESS`` : The drift detection operation completed without exceeding the failure tolerance for the operation. 
               
              * ``IN_PROGRESS`` : The drift detection operation is currently being performed. 
               
              * ``STOPPED`` : The user has cancelled the drift detection operation. 
               

              
            

            - **LastDriftCheckTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

              Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detection operation on the stack set. This value will be ``NULL`` for any stack set on which drift detection has not yet been performed.

              
            

            - **TotalStackInstancesCount** *(integer) --* 

              The total number of stack instances belonging to this stack set. 

               

              The total number of stack instances is equal to the total of:

               

               
              * Stack instances that match the stack set configuration.  
               
              * Stack instances that have drifted from the stack set configuration.  
               
              * Stack instances where the drift detection operation has failed. 
               
              * Stack instances currently being checked for drift. 
               

              
            

            - **DriftedStackInstancesCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of stack instances that have drifted from the expected template and parameter configuration of the stack set. A stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associated stack do not match their expected configuration.

              
            

            - **InSyncStackInstancesCount** *(integer) --*

                - **ParameterKey** *(string) --* 

                  The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

                  
                

                - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

                  The input value associated with the parameter.

                  
                

                - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

                  During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

                  
                

                - **ResolvedValue** *(string) --* 

                  Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

                  
            
          
            

            - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --*

            - **LastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The time the stack was last updated. This field will only be returned if the stack has been updated at least once.

              
            

            - **RollbackConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

              The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

              
              

              - **RollbackTriggers** *(list) --* 

                The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions. 

                 

                By default, AWS CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

                 

                 
                * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter. 
                 
                * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack. 
                 
                * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter. 
                 

                 

                If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A rollback trigger AWS CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation. 

                  
                  

                  - **Arn** *(string) --* 

                    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

                     

                    If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

                    
                  

                  - **Type** *(string) --* 

                    The resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cw-alarm.html>`__ is the only supported resource type.

                    
              
            
              

              - **MonitoringTimeInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

                The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

                 

                The default is 0 minutes.

                 

                If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using `CancelUpdateStack <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html>`__ , for example) as necessary.

                 

                If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

                
          
            

            - **StackStatus** *(string) --* 

              Current status of the stack.

              
            

            - **StackStatusReason** *(string) --* 

              Success/failure message associated with the stack status.

              
            

            - **DisableRollback** *(boolean) --* 

              Boolean to enable or disable rollback on stack creation failures:

               

               
              * ``true`` : disable rollback 
               
              * ``false`` : enable rollback 
               

              
            

            - **NotificationARNs** *(list) --*

            - **RoleARN** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that is associated with the stack. During a stack operation, AWS CloudFormation uses this role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.

              
            

            - **Tags** *(list) --*

          If the registered extension calls any AWS APIs, you must create an * `IAM execution role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html>`__ * that includes the necessary permissions to call those AWS APIs, and provision that execution role in your account. CloudFormation then assumes that execution role to provide your extension with the appropriate credentials.

          
        

        - **Visibility** *(string) --* 

          The scope at which the extension is visible and usable in CloudFormation operations.

  .. py:method:: detect_stack_drift(**kwargs)

    

    Detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has *drifted* , from it's expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. For each resource in the stack that supports drift detection, AWS CloudFormation compares the actual configuration of the resource with its expected template configuration. Only resource properties explicitly defined in the stack template are checked for drift. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources differ from their expected template configurations. For more information, see `Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html>`__ .

     

    Use ``DetectStackDrift`` to detect drift on all supported resources for a given stack, or  DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on individual resources.

     

    For a list of stack resources that currently support drift detection, see `Resources that Support Drift Detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift-resource-list.html>`__ .

     

     ``DetectStackDrift`` can take up to several minutes, depending on the number of resources contained within the stack. Use  DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus to monitor the progress of a detect stack drift operation. Once the drift detection operation has completed, use  DescribeStackResourceDrifts to return drift information about the stack and its resources.

     

    When detecting drift on a stack, AWS CloudFormation does not detect drift on any nested stacks belonging to that stack. Perform ``DetectStackDrift`` directly on the nested stack itself.

  .. py:method:: detect_stack_resource_drift(**kwargs)

    

    Returns information about whether a resource's actual configuration differs, or has *drifted* , from it's expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. This information includes actual and expected property values for resources in which AWS CloudFormation detects drift. Only resource properties explicitly defined in the stack template are checked for drift. For more information about stack and resource drift, see `Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html>`__ .

     

    Use ``DetectStackResourceDrift`` to detect drift on individual resources, or  DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all resources in a given stack that support drift detection.

     

    Resources that do not currently support drift detection cannot be checked. For a list of resources that support drift detection, see `Resources that Support Drift Detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift-resource-list.html>`__ .

  .. py:method:: detect_stack_set_drift(**kwargs)

    

    Detect drift on a stack set. When CloudFormation performs drift detection on a stack set, it performs drift detection on the stack associated with each stack instance in the stack set. For more information, see `How CloudFormation Performs Drift Detection on a Stack Set <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-drift.html>`__ .

     

     ``DetectStackSetDrift`` returns the ``OperationId`` of the stack set drift detection operation. Use this operation id with ``  DescribeStackSetOperation `` to monitor the progress of the drift detection operation. The drift detection operation may take some time, depending on the number of stack instances included in the stack set, as well as the number of resources included in each stack.

     

    Once the operation has completed, use the following actions to return drift information:

     

     
    * Use ``  DescribeStackSet `` to return detailed information about the stack set, including detailed information about the last *completed* drift operation performed on the stack set. (Information about drift operations that are in progress is not included.) 
     
    * Use ``  ListStackInstances `` to return a list of stack instances belonging to the stack set, including the drift status and last drift time checked of each instance. 
     
    * Use ``  DescribeStackInstance `` to return detailed information about a specific stack instance, including its drift status and last drift time checked. 
     

     

    For more information on performing a drift detection operation on a stack set, see `Detecting Unmanaged Changes in Stack Sets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-drift.html>`__ . 

     

    You can only run a single drift detection operation on a given stack set at one time. 

     

    To stop a drift detection stack set operation, use ``  StopStackSetOperation `` .

      - **FailureToleranceCount** *(integer) --* 

        The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``FailureToleranceCount`` or ``FailureTolerancePercentage`` (but not both).

         

        By default, ``0`` is specified.

        

      
      - **FailureTolerancePercentage** *(integer) --* 

        The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

         

        When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds *down* to the next whole number.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``FailureToleranceCount`` or ``FailureTolerancePercentage`` , but not both.

        The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This is dependent on the value of ``FailureToleranceCount`` . ``MaxConcurrentCount`` is at most one more than the ``FailureToleranceCount`` .

         

        Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``MaxConcurrentCount`` or ``MaxConcurrentPercentage`` , but not both.

      - **MaxConcurrentPercentage** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time.

         

        When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number. This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number as one instead.

         

        Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

          The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

          

        
        - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

          The input value associated with the parameter.

          

        
        - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

          During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

          

        
        - **ResolvedValue** *(string) --* 

          Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

  .. py:method:: execute_change_set(**kwargs)

    

    Updates a stack using the input information that was provided when the specified change set was created. After the call successfully completes, AWS CloudFormation starts updating the stack. Use the  DescribeStacks action to view the status of the update.

     

    When you execute a change set, AWS CloudFormation deletes all other change sets associated with the stack because they aren't valid for the updated stack.

     

    If a stack policy is associated with the stack, AWS CloudFormation enforces the policy during the update. You can't specify a temporary stack policy that overrides the current policy.

     

    To create a change set for the entire stack hierachy, ``IncludeNestedStacks`` must have been set to ``True`` .

        - **Summaries** *(list) --* 

          A list of ``StackSetOperationSummary`` structures that contain summary information about operations for the specified stack set.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            The structures that contain summary information about the specified operation.

            
            

            - **OperationId** *(string) --* 

              The unique ID of the stack set operation.

              
            

            - **Action** *(string) --* 

              The type of operation: ``CREATE`` , ``UPDATE`` , or ``DELETE`` . Create and delete operations affect only the specified stack instances that are associated with the specified stack set. Update operations affect both the stack set itself as well as *all* associated stack set instances.

              
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              The overall status of the operation.

               

               
              * ``FAILED`` : The operation exceeded the specified failure tolerance. The failure tolerance value that you've set for an operation is applied for each Region during stack create and update operations. If the number of failed stacks within a Region exceeds the failure tolerance, the status of the operation in the Region is set to ``FAILED`` . This in turn sets the status of the operation as a whole to ``FAILED`` , and AWS CloudFormation cancels the operation in any remaining Regions. 
               
              * ``QUEUED`` : [Service-managed permissions] For automatic deployments that require a sequence of operations, the operation is queued to be performed. For more information, see the `stack set operation status codes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html#stackset-status-codes>`__ in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. 
               
              * ``RUNNING`` : The operation is currently being performed. 
               
              * ``STOPPED`` : The user has cancelled the operation. 
               
              * ``STOPPING`` : The operation is in the process of stopping, at user request.  
               
              * ``SUCCEEDED`` : The operation completed creating or updating all the specified stacks without exceeding the failure tolerance for the operation. 
               

              
            

            - **CreationTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

              The time at which the operation was initiated. Note that the creation times for the stack set operation might differ from the creation time of the individual stacks themselves. This is because AWS CloudFormation needs to perform preparatory work for the operation, such as dispatching the work to the requested Regions, before actually creating the first stacks.

              
            

            - **EndTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

              The time at which the stack set operation ended, across all accounts and Regions specified. Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that the stack set operation was successful, or even attempted, in each account or Region.

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          If the request doesn't return all results, ``NextToken`` is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call ``ListOperationResults`` again and assign that token to the request object's ``NextToken`` parameter. If there are no remaining results, ``NextToken`` is set to ``null`` .

          
    
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`CloudFormation.Client.exceptions.StackSetNotFoundException`

    

  .. py:method:: list_stack_sets(**kwargs)

    

    Returns summary information about stack sets that are associated with the user.

     

     
    * [Self-managed permissions] If you set the ``CallAs`` parameter to ``SELF`` while signed in to your AWS account, ``ListStackSets`` returns all self-managed stack sets in your AWS account. 
     
    * [Service-managed permissions] If you set the ``CallAs`` parameter to ``SELF`` while signed in to the organization's management account, ``ListStackSets`` returns all stack sets in the management account. 
     
    * [Service-managed permissions] If you set the ``CallAs`` parameter to ``DELEGATED_ADMIN`` while signed in to your member account, ``ListStackSets`` returns all stack sets with service-managed permissions in the management account.

              The name of the extension.

               

              If you specified a ``TypeNameAlias`` when you `activate this extension <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateType.html>`__ in your account and region, CloudFormation considers that alias as the type name.

              
            

            - **DefaultVersionId** *(string) --* 

              The ID of the default version of the extension. The default version is used when the extension version is not specified.

               

              This applies only to private extensions you have registered in your account. For public extensions, both those provided by Amazon and published by third parties, CloudFormation returns ``null`` . For more information, see `RegisterType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html>`__ .

              * Private extensions you have registered in your account. For more information, see `RegisterType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html>`__ . 
               
              * Public extensions you have activated in your account with auto-update specified. For more information, see `ActivateType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateType.html>`__ . 
               

               

              For all other extension types, CloudFormation returns ``null`` .

              
            

            - **Description** *(string) --* 

              The description of the extension.

              
            

            - **PublisherId** *(string) --* 

              The ID of the extension publisher, if the extension is published by a third party. Extensions published by Amazon do not return a publisher ID.

              
            

            - **OriginalTypeName** *(string) --* 

              For public extensions that have been activated for this account and region, the type name of the public extension.

               

              If you specified a ``TypeNameAlias`` when enabling the extension in this account and region, CloudFormation treats that alias as the extension's type name within the account and region, not the type name of the public extension. For more information, see `Specifying aliases to refer to extensions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html#registry-public-enable-alias>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide* .

    Registers an extension with the CloudFormation service. Registering an extension makes it available for use in CloudFormation templates in your AWS account, and includes:

     

     
    * Validating the extension schema 
     
    * Determining which handlers, if any, have been specified for the extension 
     
    * Making the extension available for use in your account 
     

     

    For more information on how to develop extensions and ready them for registeration, see `Creating Resource Providers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-types.html>`__ in the *CloudFormation CLI User Guide* .

     

    You can have a maximum of 50 resource extension versions registered at a time. This maximum is per account and per region. Use `DeregisterType <AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterType.html>`__ to deregister specific extension versions if necessary.

     

    Once you have initiated a registration request using ``  RegisterType `` , you can use ``  DescribeTypeRegistration `` to monitor the progress of the registration request.

     

    Once you have registered a private extension in your account and region, use `SetTypeConfiguration <AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_SetTypeConfiguration.html>`__ to specify configuration properties for the extension. For more information, see `Configuring extensions at the account level <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-register.html#registry-set-configuration>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide* .

    :type TypeName: string
    :param TypeName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the extension being registered.

       

      We recommend that extension names adhere to the following patterns: 

       

       
      * For resource types, *company_or_organization* ::*service* ::*type* . 
       
      * For modules, *company_or_organization* ::*service* ::*type* ::MODULE.

        The following organization namespaces are reserved and cannot be used in your extension names:

         

         
        * ``Alexa``   
         
        * ``AMZN``

    :type SchemaHandlerPackage: string
    :param SchemaHandlerPackage: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A url to the S3 bucket containing the extension project package that contains the neccessary files for the extension you want to register.

       

      For information on generating a schema handler package for the extension you want to register, see `submit <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-cli-submit.html>`__ in the *CloudFormation CLI User Guide* .

       

      .. note::

         

        The user registering the extension must be able to access the package in the S3 bucket. That is, the user needs to have `GetObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html>`__ permissions for the schema handler package. For more information, see `Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazons3.html>`__ in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide* .

    :param LoggingConfig: 

      Specifies logging configuration information for an extension.

      

    
      - **LogRoleArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The ARN of the role that CloudFormation should assume when sending log entries to CloudWatch logs.

        

      
      - **LogGroupName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The Amazon CloudWatch log group to which CloudFormation sends error logging information when invoking the extension's handlers.

        

      
    
    :type ExecutionRoleArn: string
    :param ExecutionRoleArn: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for CloudFormation to assume when invoking the extension.

       

      For CloudFormation to assume the specified execution role, the role must contain a trust relationship with the CloudFormation service principle (``resources.cloudformation.amazonaws.com`` ). For more information on adding trust relationships, see `Modifying a role trust policy <IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-managingrole-editing-console.html#roles-managingrole_edit-trust-policy>`__ in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide* .

       

      If your extension calls AWS APIs in any of its handlers, you must create an * `IAM execution role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html>`__ * that includes the necessary permissions to call those AWS APIs, and provision that execution role in your account. When CloudFormation needs to invoke the resource type handler, CloudFormation assumes this execution role to create a temporary session token, which it then passes to the resource type handler, thereby supplying your resource type with the appropriate credentials.

      

    
    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      A unique identifier that acts as an idempotency key for this registration request. Specifying a client request token prevents CloudFormation from generating more than one version of an extension from the same registeration request, even if the request is submitted multiple times.

  .. py:method:: signal_resource(**kwargs)

    

    Sends a signal to the specified resource with a success or failure status. You can use the SignalResource API in conjunction with a creation policy or update policy. AWS CloudFormation doesn't proceed with a stack creation or update until resources receive the required number of signals or the timeout period is exceeded. The SignalResource API is useful in cases where you want to send signals from anywhere other than an Amazon EC2 instance.

    :param UniqueId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A unique ID of the signal. When you signal Amazon EC2 instances or Auto Scaling groups, specify the instance ID that you are signaling as the unique ID. If you send multiple signals to a single resource (such as signaling a wait condition), each signal requires a different unique ID.

    Tests a registered extension to make sure it meets all necessary requirements for being published in the CloudFormation registry.

     

     
    * For resource types, this includes passing all contracts tests defined for the type. 
     
    * For modules, this includes determining if the module's model meets all necessary requirements. 
     

     

    For more information, see `Testing your public extension prior to publishing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/publish-extension.html#publish-extension-testing>`__ in the *CloudFormation CLI User Guide* .

     

    If you do not specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default version of the extension in your account and region for testing.

     

    To perform testing, CloudFormation assumes the execution role specified when the test was registered. For more information, see `RegisterType <AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html>`__ .

     

    Once you've initiated testing on an extension using ``TestType`` , you can use `DescribeType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html>`__ to monitor the current test status and test status description for the extension.

     

    An extension must have a test status of ``PASSED`` before it can be published.

        - **ParameterKey** *(string) --* 

          The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

          

        
        - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

          The input value associated with the parameter.

          

        
        - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

          During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

          Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

          

        
      
  
    :type Capabilities: list
    :param Capabilities: 

      In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to update the stack.

       

       
      * ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` and ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM``   Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` or ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` capability. 

         
        * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.  
         
        * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` .  
         
        * If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an ``InsufficientCapabilities`` error. 
         

       

      If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

      * ``CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND``   Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the `AWS\:\:Include <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html>`__ and `AWS\:\:Serverless <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html>`__ transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros *and* nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability. 

      .. warning::

         You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being notified. 

       For more information, see `Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html>`__ . 
       

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ResourceTypes: list
    :param ResourceTypes: 

      The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for this update stack action, such as ``AWS::EC2::Instance`` , ``AWS::EC2::*`` , or ``Custom::MyCustomInstance`` .

       

      If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for AWS CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see `Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html>`__ .

    :type RoleARN: string
    :param RoleARN: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to update the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

       

      If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

      

    
    :type RollbackConfiguration: dict
    :param RollbackConfiguration: 

      The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

      

    
      - **RollbackTriggers** *(list) --* 

        The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions. 

         

        By default, AWS CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

         

         
        * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter. 
         
        * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack. 
         
        * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter. 
         

         

        If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A rollback trigger AWS CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation. 

          

        
          - **Arn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

             

            If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

            

          
          - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cw-alarm.html>`__ is the only supported resource type.

            

          
        
    
      - **MonitoringTimeInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

         

        The default is 0 minutes.

         

        If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using `CancelUpdateStack <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html>`__ , for example) as necessary.

         

        If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

        

      
    
    :type StackPolicyBody: string
    :param StackPolicyBody: 

      Structure containing a new stack policy body. You can specify either the ``StackPolicyBody`` or the ``StackPolicyURL`` parameter, but not both.

       

      You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you created during a stack update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack is unchanged.

      

    
    :type StackPolicyURL: string
    :param StackPolicyURL: 

      Location of a file containing the updated stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the ``StackPolicyBody`` or the ``StackPolicyURL`` parameter, but not both.

       

      You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you created during a stack update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack is unchanged.

      

    
    :type NotificationARNs: list
    :param NotificationARNs: 

      Amazon Simple Notification Service topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) that AWS CloudFormation associates with the stack. Specify an empty list to remove all notification topics.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum number of 50 tags.

       

      If you don't specify this parameter, AWS CloudFormation doesn't modify the stack's tags. If you specify an empty value, AWS CloudFormation removes all associated tags.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an AWS CloudFormation stack.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (AWS) have the reserved prefix: ``aws:`` .

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

          

        
      
  
    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      A unique identifier for this ``UpdateStack`` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to update a stack with the same name. You might retry ``UpdateStack`` requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

       

      All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a ``CreateStack`` operation with the token ``token1`` , then all the ``StackEvents`` generated by that operation will have ``ClientRequestToken`` set as ``token1`` .

       

      In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID* , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: ``Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`` .

  .. py:method:: update_stack_instances(**kwargs)

    

    Updates the parameter values for stack instances for the specified accounts, within the specified Regions. A stack instance refers to a stack in a specific account and Region. 

     

    You can only update stack instances in Regions and accounts where they already exist; to create additional stack instances, use `CreateStackInstances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStackInstances.html>`__ . 

     

    During stack set updates, any parameters overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden value.

     

    You can only update the parameter *values* that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use `UpdateStackSet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStackSet.html>`__ to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter value specified in the stack set you must first use `UpdateStackSet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStackSet.html>`__ to update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter value specified in the stack set. Once a stack instance has been updated with the new parameter, you can then override the parameter value using ``UpdateStackInstances`` .

    :param StackSetName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name or unique ID of the stack set associated with the stack instances.

      

    
    :type Accounts: list
    :param Accounts: 

      [Self-managed permissions] The names of one or more AWS accounts for which you want to update parameter values for stack instances. The overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions.

       

      You can specify ``Accounts`` or ``DeploymentTargets`` , but not both.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type DeploymentTargets: dict
    :param DeploymentTargets: 

      [Service-managed permissions] The AWS Organizations accounts for which you want to update parameter values for stack instances. If your update targets OUs, the overridden parameter values only apply to the accounts that are currently in the target OUs and their child OUs. Accounts added to the target OUs and their child OUs in the future won't use the overridden values.

       

      You can specify ``Accounts`` or ``DeploymentTargets`` , but not both.

      

    
      - **Accounts** *(list) --* 

        The names of one or more AWS accounts for which you want to deploy stack set updates.

        

      
        - *(string) --*

        The organization root ID or organizational unit (OU) IDs to which StackSets deploys.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    
    :type Regions: list
    :param Regions: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The names of one or more Regions in which you want to update parameter values for stack instances. The overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ParameterOverrides: list
    :param ParameterOverrides: 

      A list of input parameters whose values you want to update for the specified stack instances. 

       

      Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how AWS CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance update operations:

       

       
      * To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter and specify its value. 
       
      * To leave a parameter set to its present value, you can do one of the following: 

         
        * Do not include the parameter in the list. 
         
        * Include the parameter and specify ``UsePreviousValue`` as ``true`` . (You cannot specify both a value and set ``UsePreviousValue`` to ``true`` .) 
         

       
       
      * To set all overridden parameter back to the values specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but do not include any parameters. 
       
      * To leave all parameters set to their present values, do not specify this property at all. 
       

       

      During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden value.

       

      You can only override the parameter *values* that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use ``UpdateStackSet`` to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter value specified in the stack set you must first use `UpdateStackSet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStackSet.html>`__ to update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter value specified in the stack set. Once a stack instance has been updated with the new parameter, you can then override the parameter value using ``UpdateStackInstances`` .

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Parameter data type.

        

      
        - **ParameterKey** *(string) --* 

          The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

          

        
        - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

          The input value associated with the parameter.

          

        
        - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

          During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

          

        
        - **ResolvedValue** *(string) --* 

          Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

          

        
      
  
    :type OperationPreferences: dict
    :param OperationPreferences: 

      Preferences for how AWS CloudFormation performs this stack set operation.

      

    
      - **RegionConcurrencyType** *(string) --* 

        The concurrency type of deploying StackSets operations in regions, could be in parallel or one region at a time.

        

      
      - **RegionOrder** *(list) --* 

        The order of the Regions in where you want to perform the stack operation.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **FailureToleranceCount** *(integer) --* 

        The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``FailureToleranceCount`` or ``FailureTolerancePercentage`` (but not both).

         

        By default, ``0`` is specified.

        

      
      - **FailureTolerancePercentage** *(integer) --* 

        The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

         

        When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds *down* to the next whole number.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``FailureToleranceCount`` or ``FailureTolerancePercentage`` , but not both.

         

        By default, ``0`` is specified.

        

      
      - **MaxConcurrentCount** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This is dependent on the value of ``FailureToleranceCount`` . ``MaxConcurrentCount`` is at most one more than the ``FailureToleranceCount`` .

         

        Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``MaxConcurrentCount`` or ``MaxConcurrentPercentage`` , but not both.

         

        By default, ``1`` is specified.

        

      
      - **MaxConcurrentPercentage** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time.

         

        When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number. This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number as one instead.

         

        Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``MaxConcurrentCount`` or ``MaxConcurrentPercentage`` , but not both.

         

        By default, ``1`` is specified.

        

      
    
    :type OperationId: string
    :param OperationId: 

      The unique identifier for this stack set operation. 

       

      The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that AWS CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack set operation requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

       

      If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically. 

      This field is autopopulated if not provided.

    
    :type CallAs: string
    :param CallAs: 

      [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.

       

      By default, ``SELF`` is specified. Use ``SELF`` for stack sets with self-managed permissions.

       

       
      * If you are signed in to the management account, specify ``SELF`` . 
       
      * If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify ``DELEGATED_ADMIN`` . Your AWS account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see `Register a delegated administrator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* .

      A list of input parameters for the stack set template. 

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Parameter data type.

        

      
        - **ParameterKey** *(string) --* 

          The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

          

        
        - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

          The input value associated with the parameter.

          

        
        - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

          During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

          

        
        - **ResolvedValue** *(string) --* 

          Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

          

        
      
  
    :type Capabilities: list
    :param Capabilities: 

      In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to update the stack set and its associated stack instances.

       

       
      * ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` and ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM``   Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` or ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` capability. 

         
        * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.  
         
        * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` .  
         
        * If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an ``InsufficientCapabilities`` error. 
         

       

      If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

      * ``CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND``   Some templates reference macros. If your stack set template references one or more macros, you must update the stack set directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set. To update the stack set directly, you must acknowledge this capability. For more information, see `Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html>`__ . 

      .. warning::

         Stack sets with service-managed permissions do not currently support the use of macros in templates. (This includes the `AWS\:\:Include <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html>`__ and `AWS\:\:Serverless <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html>`__ transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability for a stack set with service-managed permissions, if you reference a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail. 

       
       

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the stacks created from it. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources that are created in the stacks. You can specify a maximum number of 50 tags.

       

      If you specify tags for this parameter, those tags replace any list of tags that are currently associated with this stack set. This means:

       

       
      * If you don't specify this parameter, AWS CloudFormation doesn't modify the stack's tags.  
       
      * If you specify *any* tags using this parameter, you must specify *all* the tags that you want associated with this stack set, even tags you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack set or during a previous update of the stack set.). Any tags that you don't include in the updated list of tags are removed from the stack set, and therefore from the stacks and resources as well.  
       
      * If you specify an empty value, AWS CloudFormation removes all currently associated tags. 
       

       

      If you specify new tags as part of an ``UpdateStackSet`` action, AWS CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission to tag resources. If you omit tags that are currently associated with the stack set from the list of tags you specify, AWS CloudFormation assumes that you want to remove those tags from the stack set, and checks to see if you have permission to untag resources. If you don't have the necessary permission(s), the entire ``UpdateStackSet`` action fails with an ``access denied`` error, and the stack set is not updated.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an AWS CloudFormation stack.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (AWS) have the reserved prefix: ``aws:`` .

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

          

        
      
  
    :type OperationPreferences: dict
    :param OperationPreferences: 

      Preferences for how AWS CloudFormation performs this stack set operation.

      

    
      - **RegionConcurrencyType** *(string) --* 

        The concurrency type of deploying StackSets operations in regions, could be in parallel or one region at a time.

        

      
      - **RegionOrder** *(list) --* 

        The order of the Regions in where you want to perform the stack operation.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **FailureToleranceCount** *(integer) --* 

        The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``FailureToleranceCount`` or ``FailureTolerancePercentage`` (but not both).

         

        By default, ``0`` is specified.

        

      
      - **FailureTolerancePercentage** *(integer) --* 

        The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

         

        When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds *down* to the next whole number.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``FailureToleranceCount`` or ``FailureTolerancePercentage`` , but not both.

         

        By default, ``0`` is specified.

        

      
      - **MaxConcurrentCount** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This is dependent on the value of ``FailureToleranceCount`` . ``MaxConcurrentCount`` is at most one more than the ``FailureToleranceCount`` .

         

        Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``MaxConcurrentCount`` or ``MaxConcurrentPercentage`` , but not both.

         

        By default, ``1`` is specified.

        

      
      - **MaxConcurrentPercentage** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time.

         

        When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number. This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number as one instead.

         

        Note that this setting lets you specify the *maximum* for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

         

        Conditional: You must specify either ``MaxConcurrentCount`` or ``MaxConcurrentPercentage`` , but not both.

         

        By default, ``1`` is specified.

        

      
    
    :type AdministrationRoleARN: string
    :param AdministrationRoleARN: 

      The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the IAM role to use to update this stack set.

       

      Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized administrator roles to control which users or groups can manage specific stack sets within the same administrator account. For more information, see `Granting Permissions for Stack Set Operations <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* .

       

      If you specified a customized administrator role when you created the stack set, you must specify a customized administrator role, even if it is the same customized administrator role used with this stack set previously.

      

    
    :type ExecutionRoleName: string
    :param ExecutionRoleName: 

      The name of the IAM execution role to use to update the stack set. If you do not specify an execution role, AWS CloudFormation uses the ``AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole`` role for the stack set operation.

       

      Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized execution roles to control which stack resources users and groups can include in their stack sets. 

       

      If you specify a customized execution role, AWS CloudFormation uses that role to update the stack. If you do not specify a customized execution role, AWS CloudFormation performs the update using the role previously associated with the stack set, so long as you have permissions to perform operations on the stack set.

      

    
    :type DeploymentTargets: dict
    :param DeploymentTargets: 

      [Service-managed permissions] The AWS Organizations accounts in which to update associated stack instances.

       

      To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do not specify ``DeploymentTargets`` or ``Regions`` .

       

      If the stack set update includes changes to the template (that is, if ``TemplateBody`` or ``TemplateURL`` is specified), or the ``Parameters`` , AWS CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of ``OUTDATED`` prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. If the stack set update does not include changes to the template or parameters, AWS CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other stack instances with their existing stack instance status.

      

    
      - **Accounts** *(list) --* 

        The names of one or more AWS accounts for which you want to deploy stack set updates.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **AccountsUrl** *(string) --* 

        Returns the value of the AccountsUrl property.

        

      
      - **OrganizationalUnitIds** *(list) --* 

        The organization root ID or organizational unit (OU) IDs to which StackSets deploys.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    
    :type PermissionModel: string
    :param PermissionModel: 

      Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations are created. You cannot modify ``PermissionModel`` if there are stack instances associated with your stack set.

       

       
      * With ``self-managed`` permissions, you must create the administrator and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For more information, see `Grant Self-Managed Stack Set Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.html>`__ . 
       
      * With ``service-managed`` permissions, StackSets automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by AWS Organizations. For more information, see `Grant Service-Managed Stack Set Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs-service-managed.html>`__ . 
       

      

    
    :type AutoDeployment: dict
    :param AutoDeployment: 

      [Service-managed permissions] Describes whether StackSets automatically deploys to AWS Organizations accounts that are added to a target organization or organizational unit (OU).

       

      If you specify ``AutoDeployment`` , do not specify ``DeploymentTargets`` or ``Regions`` .

      

    
      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

        If set to ``true`` , StackSets automatically deploys additional stack instances to AWS Organizations accounts that are added to a target organization or organizational unit (OU) in the specified Regions. If an account is removed from a target organization or OU, StackSets deletes stack instances from the account in the specified Regions.

        

      
      - **RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval** *(boolean) --* 

        If set to ``true`` , stack resources are retained when an account is removed from a target organization or OU. If set to ``false`` , stack resources are deleted. Specify only if ``Enabled`` is set to ``True`` .

        

      
    
    :type OperationId: string
    :param OperationId: 

      The unique ID for this stack set operation. 

       

      The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that AWS CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack set operation requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

       

      If you don't specify an operation ID, AWS CloudFormation generates one automatically.

       

      Repeating this stack set operation with a new operation ID retries all stack instances whose status is ``OUTDATED`` . 

      This field is autopopulated if not provided.

    
    :type Accounts: list
    :param Accounts: 

      [Self-managed permissions] The accounts in which to update associated stack instances. If you specify accounts, you must also specify the Regions in which to update stack set instances.

       

      To update *all* the stack instances associated with this stack set, do not specify the ``Accounts`` or ``Regions`` properties.

       

      If the stack set update includes changes to the template (that is, if the ``TemplateBody`` or ``TemplateURL`` properties are specified), or the ``Parameters`` property, AWS CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of ``OUTDATED`` prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. If the stack set update does not include changes to the template or parameters, AWS CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other stack instances with their existing stack instance status. 

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Regions: list
    :param Regions: 

      The Regions in which to update associated stack instances. If you specify Regions, you must also specify accounts in which to update stack set instances.

       

      To update *all* the stack instances associated with this stack set, do not specify the ``Accounts`` or ``Regions`` properties.

       

      If the stack set update includes changes to the template (that is, if the ``TemplateBody`` or ``TemplateURL`` properties are specified), or the ``Parameters`` property, AWS CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of ``OUTDATED`` prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. If the stack set update does not include changes to the template or parameters, AWS CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other stack instances with their existing stack instance status. 

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type CallAs: string
    :param CallAs: 

      [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.

       

      By default, ``SELF`` is specified. Use ``SELF`` for stack sets with self-managed permissions.

       

       
      * If you are signed in to the management account, specify ``SELF`` . 
       
      * If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify ``DELEGATED_ADMIN`` . Your AWS account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see `Register a delegated administrator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* .

        - **Description** *(string) --* 

          Information about the change set.

          
        

        - **Parameters** *(list) --* 

          A list of ``Parameter`` structures that describes the input parameters and their values used to create the change set. For more information, see the `Parameter <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html>`__ data type.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            The Parameter data type.

            
            

            - **ParameterKey** *(string) --* 

              The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

              
            

            - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

              The input value associated with the parameter.

              
            

            - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

              During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

              
            

            - **ResolvedValue** *(string) --* 

              Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

              
        
      
        

        - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The start time when the change set was created, in UTC.

          
        

        - **ExecutionStatus** *(string) --* 

          If the change set execution status is ``AVAILABLE`` , you can execute the change set. If you can’t execute the change set, the status indicates why. For example, a change set might be in an ``UNAVAILABLE`` state because AWS CloudFormation is still creating it or in an ``OBSOLETE`` state because the stack was already updated.

          
        

        - **Status** *(string) --* 

          The current status of the change set, such as ``CREATE_IN_PROGRESS`` , ``CREATE_COMPLETE`` , or ``FAILED`` .

          
        

        - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

          A description of the change set's status. For example, if your attempt to create a change set failed, AWS CloudFormation shows the error message.

          
        

        - **NotificationARNs** *(list) --* 

          The ARNs of the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics that will be associated with the stack if you execute the change set.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **RollbackConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

          The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

          
          

          - **RollbackTriggers** *(list) --* 

            The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions. 

             

            By default, AWS CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

             

             
            * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter. 
             
            * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack. 
             
            * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter. 
             

             

            If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A rollback trigger AWS CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation. 

              
              

              - **Arn** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

                 

                If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

                
              

              - **Type** *(string) --* 

                The resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cw-alarm.html>`__ is the only supported resource type.

                
          
        
          

          - **MonitoringTimeInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

            The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

             

            The default is 0 minutes.

             

            If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using `CancelUpdateStack <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html>`__ , for example) as necessary.

             

            If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

            
      
        

        - **Capabilities** *(list) --* 

          If you execute the change set, the list of capabilities that were explicitly acknowledged when the change set was created.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **Tags** *(list) --* 

          If you execute the change set, the tags that will be associated with the stack.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an AWS CloudFormation stack.

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

               *Required* . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (AWS) have the reserved prefix: ``aws:`` .

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

               *Required* . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

              
        
      
        

        - **Changes** *(list) --* 

          A list of ``Change`` structures that describes the resources AWS CloudFormation changes if you execute the change set.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            The ``Change`` structure describes the changes AWS CloudFormation will perform if you execute the change set.

            
            

            - **Type** *(string) --* 

              The type of entity that AWS CloudFormation changes. Currently, the only entity type is ``Resource`` .

              
            

            - **ResourceChange** *(dict) --* 

              A ``ResourceChange`` structure that describes the resource and action that AWS CloudFormation will perform.

              
              

              - **Action** *(string) --* 

                The action that AWS CloudFormation takes on the resource, such as ``Add`` (adds a new resource), ``Modify`` (changes a resource), ``Remove`` (deletes a resource), ``Import`` (imports a resource), or ``Dynamic`` (exact action for the resource cannot be determined).

                
              

              - **LogicalResourceId** *(string) --* 

                The resource's logical ID, which is defined in the stack's template.

                
              

              - **PhysicalResourceId** *(string) --* 

                The resource's physical ID (resource name). Resources that you are adding don't have physical IDs because they haven't been created.

                
              

              - **ResourceType** *(string) --* 

                The type of AWS CloudFormation resource, such as ``AWS::S3::Bucket`` .

                
              

              - **Replacement** *(string) --* 

                For the ``Modify`` action, indicates whether AWS CloudFormation will replace the resource by creating a new one and deleting the old one. This value depends on the value of the ``RequiresRecreation`` property in the ``ResourceTargetDefinition`` structure. For example, if the ``RequiresRecreation`` field is ``Always`` and the ``Evaluation`` field is ``Static`` , ``Replacement`` is ``True`` . If the ``RequiresRecreation`` field is ``Always`` and the ``Evaluation`` field is ``Dynamic`` , ``Replacement`` is ``Conditionally`` .

                 

                If you have multiple changes with different ``RequiresRecreation`` values, the ``Replacement`` value depends on the change with the most impact. A ``RequiresRecreation`` value of ``Always`` has the most impact, followed by ``Conditionally`` , and then ``Never`` .

                
              

              - **Scope** *(list) --* 

                For the ``Modify`` action, indicates which resource attribute is triggering this update, such as a change in the resource attribute's ``Metadata`` , ``Properties`` , or ``Tags`` .

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **Details** *(list) --* 

                For the ``Modify`` action, a list of ``ResourceChangeDetail`` structures that describes the changes that AWS CloudFormation will make to the resource. 

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  For a resource with ``Modify`` as the action, the ``ResourceChange`` structure describes the changes AWS CloudFormation will make to that resource.

                  
                  

                  - **Target** *(dict) --* 

                    A ``ResourceTargetDefinition`` structure that describes the field that AWS CloudFormation will change and whether the resource will be recreated.

                    
                    

                    - **Attribute** *(string) --* 

                      Indicates which resource attribute is triggering this update, such as a change in the resource attribute's ``Metadata`` , ``Properties`` , or ``Tags`` .

                      
                    

                    - **Name** *(string) --* 

                      If the ``Attribute`` value is ``Properties`` , the name of the property. For all other attributes, the value is null.

                      
                    

                    - **RequiresRecreation** *(string) --* 

                      If the ``Attribute`` value is ``Properties`` , indicates whether a change to this property causes the resource to be recreated. The value can be ``Never`` , ``Always`` , or ``Conditionally`` . To determine the conditions for a ``Conditionally`` recreation, see the update behavior for that `property <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html>`__ in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

                      
                
                  

                  - **Evaluation** *(string) --* 

                    Indicates whether AWS CloudFormation can determine the target value, and whether the target value will change before you execute a change set.

                     

                    For ``Static`` evaluations, AWS CloudFormation can determine that the target value will change, and its value. For example, if you directly modify the ``InstanceType`` property of an EC2 instance, AWS CloudFormation knows that this property value will change, and its value, so this is a ``Static`` evaluation.

                     

                    For ``Dynamic`` evaluations, cannot determine the target value because it depends on the result of an intrinsic function, such as a ``Ref`` or ``Fn::GetAtt`` intrinsic function, when the stack is updated. For example, if your template includes a reference to a resource that is conditionally recreated, the value of the reference (the physical ID of the resource) might change, depending on if the resource is recreated. If the resource is recreated, it will have a new physical ID, so all references to that resource will also be updated.

                    
                  

                  - **ChangeSource** *(string) --* 

                    The group to which the ``CausingEntity`` value belongs. There are five entity groups:

                     

                     
                    * ``ResourceReference`` entities are ``Ref`` intrinsic functions that refer to resources in the template, such as ``{ "Ref" : "MyEC2InstanceResource" }`` . 
                     
                    * ``ParameterReference`` entities are ``Ref`` intrinsic functions that get template parameter values, such as ``{ "Ref" : "MyPasswordParameter" }`` . 
                     
                    * ``ResourceAttribute`` entities are ``Fn::GetAtt`` intrinsic functions that get resource attribute values, such as ``{ "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "MyEC2InstanceResource", "PublicDnsName" ] }`` . 
                     
                    * ``DirectModification`` entities are changes that are made directly to the template. 
                     
                    * ``Automatic`` entities are ``AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`` resource types, which are also known as nested stacks. If you made no changes to the ``AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`` resource, AWS CloudFormation sets the ``ChangeSource`` to ``Automatic`` because the nested stack's template might have changed. Changes to a nested stack's template aren't visible to AWS CloudFormation until you run an update on the parent stack. 
                     

                    
                  

                  - **CausingEntity** *(string) --* 

                    The identity of the entity that triggered this change. This entity is a member of the group that is specified by the ``ChangeSource`` field. For example, if you modified the value of the ``KeyPairName`` parameter, the ``CausingEntity`` is the name of the parameter (``KeyPairName`` ).

                     

                    If the ``ChangeSource`` value is ``DirectModification`` , no value is given for ``CausingEntity`` .

                    
              
            
              

              - **ChangeSetId** *(string) --* 

                The change set ID of the nested change set.

                
              

              - **ModuleInfo** *(dict) --* 

                Contains information about the module from which the resource was created, if the resource was created from a module included in the stack template.

                
                

                - **TypeHierarchy** *(string) --* 

                  A concantenated list of the the module type or types containing the resource. Module types are listed starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated by ``/`` .

                   

                  In the following example, the resource was created from a module of type ``AWS::First::Example::MODULE`` , that is nested inside a parent module of type ``AWS::Second::Example::MODULE`` .

                   

                   ``AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MODULE``  

                  
                

                - **LogicalIdHierarchy** *(string) --* 

                  A concantenated list of the logical IDs of the module or modules containing the resource. Modules are listed starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated by ``/`` .

                   

                  In the following example, the resource was created from a module, ``moduleA`` , that is nested inside a parent module, ``moduleB`` .

                   

                   ``moduleA/moduleB``  

                   

                  For more information, see `Referencing resources in a module <AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/modules.html#module-ref-resources>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide* .

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **IncludeNestedStacks** *(boolean) --* 

          Verifies if ``IncludeNestedStacks`` is set to ``True`` .

          
        

        - **ParentChangeSetId** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the change set ID of the parent change set in the current nested change set hierarchy.

          
        

        - **RootChangeSetId** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the change set ID of the root change set in the current nested change set hierarchy.

            - **LogicalResourceId** *(string) --* 

              The logical name of the resource specified in the template.

              
            

            - **PhysicalResourceId** *(string) --* 

              The name or unique identifier associated with the physical instance of the resource.

              
            

            - **ResourceType** *(string) --* 

              Type of resource. (For more information, go to `AWS Resource Types Reference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html>`__ in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.)

              
            

            - **Timestamp** *(datetime) --* 

              Time the status was updated.

              
            

            - **ResourceStatus** *(string) --* 

              Current status of the resource.

              
            

            - **ResourceStatusReason** *(string) --* 

              Success/failure message associated with the resource.

              
            

            - **ResourceProperties** *(string) --* 

              BLOB of the properties used to create the resource.

              
            

            - **ClientRequestToken** *(string) --* 

              The token passed to the operation that generated this event.

               

              All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a ``CreateStack`` operation with the token ``token1`` , then all the ``StackEvents`` generated by that operation will have ``ClientRequestToken`` set as ``token1`` .

               

              In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID* , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: ``Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`` .

                - **ParameterKey** *(string) --* 

                  The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

                  
                

                - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

                  The input value associated with the parameter.

                  During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

                  
                

                - **ResolvedValue** *(string) --* 

                  Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key.

            - **LastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The time the stack was last updated. This field will only be returned if the stack has been updated at least once.

              
            

            - **RollbackConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

              The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

              
              

              - **RollbackTriggers** *(list) --* 

                The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions. 

                 

                By default, AWS CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

                 

                 
                * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter. 
                 
                * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack. 
                 
                * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter. 
                 

                 

                If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A rollback trigger AWS CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation. 

                  
                  

                  - **Arn** *(string) --* 

                    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

                     

                    If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

                    
                  

                  - **Type** *(string) --* 

                    The resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cw-alarm.html>`__ is the only supported resource type.

                    
              
            
              

              - **MonitoringTimeInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

                The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

                 

                The default is 0 minutes.

                 

                If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using `CancelUpdateStack <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html>`__ , for example) as necessary.

                 

                If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

                
          
            

            - **StackStatus** *(string) --* 

              Current status of the stack.

              Success/failure message associated with the stack status.

              
            

            - **DisableRollback** *(boolean) --* 

              Boolean to enable or disable rollback on stack creation failures:

               

               
              * ``true`` : disable rollback 
               
              * ``false`` : enable rollback 
               

              
            

            - **NotificationARNs** *(list) --*

            - **RoleARN** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that is associated with the stack. During a stack operation, AWS CloudFormation uses this role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.

              
            

            - **Tags** *(list) --*

              If the change set execution status is ``AVAILABLE`` , you can execute the change set. If you can’t execute the change set, the status indicates why. For example, a change set might be in an ``UNAVAILABLE`` state because AWS CloudFormation is still creating it or in an ``OBSOLETE`` state because the stack was already updated.

              
            

            - **Status** *(string) --*

                * ``FAILED`` : The account gate function has determined that the account and Region does not meet the requirements for a stack set operation to occur. AWS CloudFormation cancels the stack set operation in that account and Region, and sets the stack set operation result status for that account and Region to ``FAILED`` .  
                 
                * ``SKIPPED`` : AWS CloudFormation has skipped calling the account gate function for this account and Region, for one of the following reasons: 

                   
                  * An account gate function has not been specified for the account and Region. AWS CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation in this account and Region. 
                   
                  * The ``AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole`` of the stack set adminstration account lacks permissions to invoke the function. AWS CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation in this account and Region. 
                   
                  * Either no action is necessary, or no action is possible, on the stack. AWS CloudFormation skips the stack set operation in this account and Region.

Update operations affect both the stack set itself as well as *all* associated stack set instances.

              
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              The overall status of the operation.

               

               
              * ``FAILED`` : The operation exceeded the specified failure tolerance. The failure tolerance value that you've set for an operation is applied for each Region during stack create and update operations. If the number of failed stacks within a Region exceeds the failure tolerance, the status of the operation in the Region is set to ``FAILED`` . This in turn sets the status of the operation as a whole to ``FAILED`` , and AWS CloudFormation cancels the operation in any remaining Regions. 
               
              * ``QUEUED`` : [Service-managed permissions] For automatic deployments that require a sequence of operations, the operation is queued to be performed. For more information, see the `stack set operation status codes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html#stackset-status-codes>`__ in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. 
               
              * ``RUNNING`` : The operation is currently being performed. 
               
              * ``STOPPED`` : The user has cancelled the operation. 
               
              * ``STOPPING`` : The operation is in the process of stopping, at user request.  
               
              * ``SUCCEEDED`` : The operation completed creating or updating all the specified stacks without exceeding the failure tolerance for the operation. 
               

              
            

            - **CreationTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

              The time at which the operation was initiated. Note that the creation times for the stack set operation might differ from the creation time of the individual stacks themselves. This is because AWS CloudFormation needs to perform preparatory work for the operation, such as dispatching the work to the requested Regions, before actually creating the first stacks.

              
            

            - **EndTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

              The time at which the stack set operation ended, across all accounts and Regions specified. Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that the stack set operation was successful, or even attempted, in each account or Region.

      For resource types, the provisioning behavior of the resource type. AWS CloudFormation determines the provisioning type during registration, based on the types of handlers in the schema handler package submitted.

       

      Valid values include:

       

       
      * ``FULLY_MUTABLE`` : The resource type includes an update handler to process updates to the type during stack update operations. 
       
      * ``IMMUTABLE`` : The resource type does not include an update handler, so the type cannot be updated and must instead be replaced during stack update operations. 
       
      * ``NON_PROVISIONABLE`` : The resource type does not include create, read, and delete handlers, and therefore cannot actually be provisioned. 
       

       

      The default is ``FULLY_MUTABLE`` .

      

    
    :type DeprecatedStatus: string
    :param DeprecatedStatus: 

      The deprecation status of the extension that you want to get summary information about.

       

      Valid values include:

       

       
      * ``LIVE`` : The extension is registered for use in CloudFormation operations. 
       
      * ``DEPRECATED`` : The extension has been deregistered and can no longer be used in CloudFormation operations.  
       

      

    
    :type Type: string
    :param Type: 

      The type of extension.

      

    
    :type Filters: dict
    :param Filters: 

      Filter criteria to use in determining which extensions to return.

       

      If you specify a filter, CloudFormation ignores any specified ``Visibility`` value when returning the list of types.

      

    
      - **Category** *(string) --* 

        The category of extensions to return.

         

         
        * ``REGISTERED`` : Private extensions that have been registered for this account and region. 
         
        * ``ACTIVATED`` : Public extensions that have been activated for this account and region. 
         
        * ``THIRD-PARTY`` : Extensions available for use from publishers other than Amazon. This includes: 

           
          * Private extensions registered in the account. 
           
          * Public extensions from publishers other than Amazon, whether activated or not. 
           

         
         
        * ``AWS-TYPES`` : Extensions available for use from Amazon. 
         

        

      
      - **PublisherId** *(string) --* 

        The id of the publisher of the extension. 

         

        Extensions published by Amazon are not assigned a publisher ID. Use the ``AWS-TYPES`` category to specify a list of types published by Amazon.

        

      
      - **TypeNamePrefix** *(string) --* 

        A prefix to use as a filter for results.

        

      
    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

        

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **TypeSummaries** *(list) --* 

          A list of ``TypeSummary`` structures that contain information about the specified extensions.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Contains summary information about the specified CloudFormation extension.

            
            

            - **Type** *(string) --* 

              The kind of extension.

              
            

            - **TypeName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the extension.

               

              If you specified a ``TypeNameAlias`` when you `activate this extension <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateType.html>`__ in your account and region, CloudFormation considers that alias as the type name.

              
            

            - **DefaultVersionId** *(string) --* 

              The ID of the default version of the extension. The default version is used when the extension version is not specified.

               

              This applies only to private extensions you have registered in your account. For public extensions, both those provided by Amazon and published by third parties, CloudFormation returns ``null`` . For more information, see `RegisterType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html>`__ .

               

              To set the default version of an extension, use ``  SetTypeDefaultVersion `` . 

              
            

            - **TypeArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.

              
            

            - **LastUpdated** *(datetime) --* 

              When the specified extension version was registered. This applies only to:

               

               
              * Private extensions you have registered in your account. For more information, see `RegisterType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html>`__ . 
               
              * Public extensions you have activated in your account with auto-update specified. For more information, see `ActivateType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateType.html>`__ . 
               

               

              For all other extension types, CloudFormation returns ``null`` .

              
            

            - **Description** *(string) --* 

              The description of the extension.

              
            

            - **PublisherId** *(string) --* 

              The ID of the extension publisher, if the extension is published by a third party. Extensions published by Amazon do not return a publisher ID.

              
            

            - **OriginalTypeName** *(string) --* 

              For public extensions that have been activated for this account and region, the type name of the public extension.

               

              If you specified a ``TypeNameAlias`` when enabling the extension in this account and region, CloudFormation treats that alias as the extension's type name within the account and region, not the type name of the public extension. For more information, see `Specifying aliases to refer to extensions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html#registry-public-enable-alias>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide* .

              
            

            - **PublicVersionNumber** *(string) --* 

              For public extensions that have been activated for this account and region, the version of the public extension to be used for CloudFormation operations in this account and region.

               

              How you specified ``AutoUpdate`` when enabling the extension affects whether CloudFormation automatically updates the extention in this account and region when a new version is released. For more information, see `Setting CloudFormation to automatically use new versions of extensions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html#registry-public-enable-auto>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide* .

              
            

            - **LatestPublicVersion** *(string) --* 

              For public extensions that have been activated for this account and region, the latest version of the public extension *that is available* . For any extensions other than activated third-arty extensions, CloudFormation returns ``null`` .

               

              How you specified ``AutoUpdate`` when enabling the extension affects whether CloudFormation automatically updates the extention in this account and region when a new version is released. For more information, see `Setting CloudFormation to automatically use new versions of extensions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html#registry-public-enable-auto>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide* .

              
            

            - **PublisherIdentity** *(string) --* 

              The service used to verify the publisher identity.

               

              For more information, see `Registering your account to publish CloudFormation extensions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/publish-extension.html>`__ in the *CFN-CLI User Guide for Extension Development* .

              
            

            - **PublisherName** *(string) --* 

              The publisher name, as defined in the public profile for that publisher in the service used to verify the publisher identity.

              
            

            - **IsActivated** *(boolean) --* 

              Whether or not the extension is activated for this account and region. 

               

              This applies only to third-party public extensions. Extensions published by Amazon are activated by default.

    :type StackName: string
    :param StackName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name that is associated with the stack. The name must be unique in the Region in which you are creating the stack.

       

      .. note::

         

        A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and cannot be longer than 128 characters.

         

      

    
    :type TemplateBody: string
    :param TemplateBody: 

      Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, go to `Template Anatomy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html>`__ in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

       

      Conditional: You must specify either the ``TemplateBody`` or the ``TemplateURL`` parameter, but not both.

      

    
    :type TemplateURL: string
    :param TemplateURL: 

      Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Manager document. For more information, go to the `Template Anatomy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html>`__ in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

       

      Conditional: You must specify either the ``TemplateBody`` or the ``TemplateURL`` parameter, but not both.

      

    
    :type Parameters: list
    :param Parameters: 

      A list of ``Parameter`` structures that specify input parameters for the stack. For more information, see the `Parameter <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html>`__ data type.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Parameter data type.

        

      
        - **ParameterKey** *(string) --* 

          The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

          

        
        - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

          The input value associated with the parameter.

          

        
        - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

          During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

          

        
        - **ResolvedValue** *(string) --* 

          Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

          

        
      
  
    :type DisableRollback: boolean
    :param DisableRollback: 

      Set to ``true`` to disable rollback of the stack if stack creation failed. You can specify either ``DisableRollback`` or ``OnFailure`` , but not both.

       

      Default: ``false``  

      

    
    :type RollbackConfiguration: dict
    :param RollbackConfiguration: 

      The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

      

    
      - **RollbackTriggers** *(list) --* 

        The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions. 

         

        By default, AWS CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

         

         
        * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter. 
         
        * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack. 
         
        * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter. 
         

         

        If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A rollback trigger AWS CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation. 

          

        
          - **Arn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

             

            If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

            

          
          - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cw-alarm.html>`__ is the only supported resource type.

            

          
        
    
      - **MonitoringTimeInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

         

        The default is 0 minutes.

         

        If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using `CancelUpdateStack <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html>`__ , for example) as necessary.

         

        If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

        

      
    
    :type TimeoutInMinutes: integer
    :param TimeoutInMinutes: 

      The amount of time that can pass before the stack status becomes CREATE_FAILED; if ``DisableRollback`` is not set or is set to ``false`` , the stack will be rolled back.

      

    
    :type NotificationARNs: list
    :param NotificationARNs: 

      The Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic ARNs to publish stack related events. You can find your SNS topic ARNs using the SNS console or your Command Line Interface (CLI).

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Capabilities: list
    :param Capabilities: 

      In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to create the stack.

       

       
      * ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` and ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM``   Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` or ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` capability. 

         
        * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.  
         
        * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` .  
         
        * If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an ``InsufficientCapabilities`` error. 
         

       

      If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

      For more information, see `Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS CloudFormation Templates <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html#capabilities>`__ .

       
       
      * ``CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND``   Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the `AWS\:\:Include <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html>`__ and `AWS\:\:Serverless <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html>`__ transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros *and* nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability. 

      .. warning::

         You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being notified. 

       For more information, see `Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html>`__ . 
       

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ResourceTypes: list
    :param ResourceTypes: 

      The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for this create stack action, such as ``AWS::EC2::Instance`` , ``AWS::EC2::*`` , or ``Custom::MyCustomInstance`` . Use the following syntax to describe template resource types: ``AWS::*`` (for all AWS resource), ``Custom::*`` (for all custom resources), ``Custom::*logical_ID* `` (for a specific custom resource), ``AWS::*service_name* ::*`` (for all resources of a particular AWS service), and ``AWS::*service_name* ::*resource_logical_ID* `` (for a specific AWS resource).

       

      If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're creating, the stack creation fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for AWS CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see `Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html>`__ .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type RoleARN: string
    :param RoleARN: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to create the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

       

      If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

      

    
    :type OnFailure: string
    :param OnFailure: 

      Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. This must be one of: DO_NOTHING, ROLLBACK, or DELETE. You can specify either ``OnFailure`` or ``DisableRollback`` , but not both.

       

      Default: ``ROLLBACK``  

      

    
    :type StackPolicyBody: string
    :param StackPolicyBody: 

      Structure containing the stack policy body. For more information, go to `Prevent Updates to Stack Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* . You can specify either the ``StackPolicyBody`` or the ``StackPolicyURL`` parameter, but not both.

      

    
    :type StackPolicyURL: string
    :param StackPolicyURL: 

      Location of a file containing the stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (maximum size: 16 KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the ``StackPolicyBody`` or the ``StackPolicyURL`` parameter, but not both.

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to the resources created in the stack. A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an AWS CloudFormation stack.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (AWS) have the reserved prefix: ``aws:`` .

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

          

        
      
  
    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      A unique identifier for this ``CreateStack`` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create a stack with the same name. You might retry ``CreateStack`` requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

       

      All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a ``CreateStack`` operation with the token ``token1`` , then all the ``StackEvents`` generated by that operation will have ``ClientRequestToken`` set as ``token1`` .

       

      In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID* , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: ``Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`` .

      Whether to enable termination protection on the specified stack. If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the operation fails and the stack remains unchanged. For more information, see `Protecting a Stack From Being Deleted <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* . Termination protection is disabled on stacks by default. 

       

      For `nested stacks <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html>`__ , termination protection is set on the root stack and cannot be changed directly on the nested stack.

  Attributes
  
  Attributes provide access to the properties of a resource. Attributes are lazy-loaded the first time one is accessed via the :py:meth:`load` method.
  For more information about attributes refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: client_request_token

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The token passed to the operation that generated this event.

       

      All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a ``CreateStack`` operation with the token ``token1`` , then all the ``StackEvents`` generated by that operation will have ``ClientRequestToken`` set as ``token1`` .

       

      In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID* , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: ``Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`` .

  .. py:attribute:: role_arn

    

    - *(string) --*

  .. py:attribute:: rollback_configuration

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

      
      

      - **RollbackTriggers** *(list) --* 

        The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions. 

         

        By default, AWS CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

         

         
        * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter. 
         
        * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack. 
         
        * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter. 
         

         

        If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A rollback trigger AWS CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation. 

          
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

             

            If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

            
          

          - **Type** *(string) --* 

            The resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cw-alarm.html>`__ is the only supported resource type.

            
      
    
      

      - **MonitoringTimeInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

         

        The default is 0 minutes.

         

        If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using `CancelUpdateStack <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html>`__ , for example) as necessary.

         

        If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

  .. py:attribute:: tags

    

    - *(list) --* 

      A list of ``Tag`` s that specify information about the stack.

      
      

      - *(dict) --* 

        The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an AWS CloudFormation stack.

        
        

        - **Key** *(string) --* 

           *Required* . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (AWS) have the reserved prefix: ``aws:`` .

          
        

        - **Value** *(string) --* 

           *Required* . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: cancel_update(**kwargs)

    

    Cancels an update on the specified stack. If the call completes successfully, the stack rolls back the update and reverts to the previous stack configuration.

     

    .. note::

       

      You can cancel only stacks that are in the UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS state.

       

    

    See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudformation-2010-05-15/CancelUpdateStack>`_    


    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = stack.cancel_update(
          ClientRequestToken='string'
      )
    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      A unique identifier for this ``CancelUpdateStack`` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to cancel an update on a stack with the same name. You might retry ``CancelUpdateStack`` requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

      

    
    
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: delete(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes a specified stack. Once the call completes successfully, stack deletion starts. Deleted stacks do not show up in the  DescribeStacks API if the deletion has been completed successfully.

    

    See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudformation-2010-05-15/DeleteStack>`_    


    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = stack.delete(
          RetainResources=[
              'string',

          RoleARN='string',
          ClientRequestToken='string'
      )
    :type RetainResources: list
    :param RetainResources: 

      For stacks in the ``DELETE_FAILED`` state, a list of resource logical IDs that are associated with the resources you want to retain. During deletion, AWS CloudFormation deletes the stack but does not delete the retained resources.

       

      Retaining resources is useful when you cannot delete a resource, such as a non-empty S3 bucket, but you want to delete the stack.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type RoleARN: string
    :param RoleARN: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to delete the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.

       

      If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

      

    
    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      A unique identifier for this ``DeleteStack`` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to delete a stack with the same name. You might retry ``DeleteStack`` requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

       

      All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a ``CreateStack`` operation with the token ``token1`` , then all the ``StackEvents`` generated by that operation will have ``ClientRequestToken`` set as ``token1`` .

       

      In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID* , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: ``Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`` . 

      

    
    
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: get_available_subresources()

        
    Returns a list of all the available sub-resources for this
    Resource.
    
    :returns: A list containing the name of each sub-resource for this
        resource
    :rtype: list of str


  .. py:method:: load()

    Calls :py:meth:`CloudFormation.Client.describe_stacks` to update the attributes of the Stack resource. Note that the load and reload methods are the same method and can be used interchangeably.

  .. py:method:: update(**kwargs)

    

    Updates a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes successfully, the stack update starts. You can check the status of the stack via the  DescribeStacks action.

     

    To get a copy of the template for an existing stack, you can use the  GetTemplate action.

    :param StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody: 

      Structure containing the temporary overriding stack policy body. You can specify either the ``StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody`` or the ``StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL`` parameter, but not both.

       

      If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary overriding stack policy during this update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be used.

      

    
    :type StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL: string
    :param StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL: 

      Location of a file containing the temporary overriding stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the ``StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody`` or the ``StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL`` parameter, but not both.

       

      If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary overriding stack policy during this update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be used.

      

    
    :type Parameters: list
    :param Parameters: 

      A list of ``Parameter`` structures that specify input parameters for the stack. For more information, see the `Parameter <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html>`__ data type.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Parameter data type.

        

      
        - **ParameterKey** *(string) --* 

          The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

          

        
        - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

          The input value associated with the parameter.

          

        
        - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

          During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

          

        
        - **ResolvedValue** *(string) --* 

          Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

          

        
      
  
    :type Capabilities: list
    :param Capabilities: 

      In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to update the stack.

       

       
      * ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` and ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM``   Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` or ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` capability. 

         
        * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.  
         
        * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` .  
         
        * If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an ``InsufficientCapabilities`` error. 
         

       

      If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

      * ``CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND``   Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the `AWS\:\:Include <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html>`__ and `AWS\:\:Serverless <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html>`__ transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros *and* nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability. 

      .. warning::

         You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being notified. 

       For more information, see `Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html>`__ . 
       

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ResourceTypes: list
    :param ResourceTypes: 

      The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for this update stack action, such as ``AWS::EC2::Instance`` , ``AWS::EC2::*`` , or ``Custom::MyCustomInstance`` .

       

      If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for AWS CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see `Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html>`__ .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type RoleARN: string
    :param RoleARN: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to update the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

       

      If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

      

    
    :type RollbackConfiguration: dict
    :param RollbackConfiguration: 

      The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

      

    
      - **RollbackTriggers** *(list) --* 

        The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions. 

         

        By default, AWS CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

         

         
        * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter. 
         
        * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack. 
         
        * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter. 
         

         

        If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A rollback trigger AWS CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation. 

          

        
          - **Arn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

             

            If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

            

          
          - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cw-alarm.html>`__ is the only supported resource type.

            

          
        
    
      - **MonitoringTimeInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

         

        The default is 0 minutes.

         

        If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using `CancelUpdateStack <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html>`__ , for example) as necessary.

         

        If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

        

      
    
    :type StackPolicyBody: string
    :param StackPolicyBody: 

      Structure containing a new stack policy body. You can specify either the ``StackPolicyBody`` or the ``StackPolicyURL`` parameter, but not both.

       

      You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you created during a stack update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack is unchanged.

      

    
    :type StackPolicyURL: string
    :param StackPolicyURL: 

      Location of a file containing the updated stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the ``StackPolicyBody`` or the ``StackPolicyURL`` parameter, but not both.

       

      You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you created during a stack update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack is unchanged.

      

    
    :type NotificationARNs: list
    :param NotificationARNs: 

      Amazon Simple Notification Service topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) that AWS CloudFormation associates with the stack. Specify an empty list to remove all notification topics.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum number of 50 tags.

       

      If you don't specify this parameter, AWS CloudFormation doesn't modify the stack's tags. If you specify an empty value, AWS CloudFormation removes all associated tags.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an AWS CloudFormation stack.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (AWS) have the reserved prefix: ``aws:`` .

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

           *Required* . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

          

        
      
  
    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      A unique identifier for this ``UpdateStack`` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to update a stack with the same name. You might retry ``UpdateStack`` requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

       

      All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a ``CreateStack`` operation with the token ``token1`` , then all the ``StackEvents`` generated by that operation will have ``ClientRequestToken`` set as ``token1`` .

       

      In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID* , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: ``Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`` .
