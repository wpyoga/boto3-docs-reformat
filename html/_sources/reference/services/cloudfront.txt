  .. py:method:: associate_alias(**kwargs)

    

    Associates an alias (also known as a CNAME or an alternate domain name) with a CloudFront distribution.

     

    With this operation you can move an alias that’s already in use on a CloudFront distribution to a different distribution in one step. This prevents the downtime that could occur if you first remove the alias from one distribution and then separately add the alias to another distribution.

     

    To use this operation to associate an alias with a distribution, you provide the alias and the ID of the target distribution for the alias. For more information, including how to set up the target distribution, prerequisites that you must complete, and other restrictions, see `Moving an alternate domain name to a different distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html#alternate-domain-names-move>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.associate_alias(
          TargetDistributionId='string',
          Alias='string'
      )
    :type TargetDistributionId: string
    :param TargetDistributionId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ID of the distribution that you’re associating the alias with.

      

    
    :type Alias: string
    :param Alias: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The alias (also known as a CNAME) to add to the target distribution.

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: create_cache_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a cache policy.

     

    After you create a cache policy, you can attach it to one or more cache behaviors. When it’s attached to a cache behavior, the cache policy determines the following:

     

     
    * The values that CloudFront includes in the *cache key* . These values can include HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings. CloudFront uses the cache key to find an object in its cache that it can return to the viewer. 
     
    * The default, minimum, and maximum time to live (TTL) values that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache. 
     

     

    The headers, cookies, and query strings that are included in the cache key are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. CloudFront sends a request when it can’t find an object in its cache that matches the request’s cache key. If you want to send values to the origin but *not* include them in the cache key, use ``OriginRequestPolicy`` .

     

    For more information about cache policies, see `Controlling the cache key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          }
      )
    :type CachePolicyConfig: dict
    :param CachePolicyConfig: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A cache policy configuration.

      

    
      - **Comment** *(string) --* 

        A comment to describe the cache policy. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

        

      
      - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A unique name to identify the cache policy.

        

      
      - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

        The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value as the object’s time to live (TTL) only when the origin does *not* send ``Cache-Control`` or ``Expires`` headers with the object. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

         

        The default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one day). If the value of ``MinTTL`` is more than 86400 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of ``MinTTL`` .

        

      
      - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value only when the origin sends ``Cache-Control`` or ``Expires`` headers with the object. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

         

        The default value for this field is 31536000 seconds (one year). If the value of ``MinTTL`` or ``DefaultTTL`` is more than 31536000 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of ``DefaultTTL`` .

        

      
      - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        

      
      - **ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin** *(dict) --* 

        The HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings to include in the cache key. The values included in the cache key are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

        

      
        - **EnableAcceptEncodingGzip** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

           

          This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true``  *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

           

           
          * Normalizes the value of the viewer’s ``Accept-Encoding`` header 
           
          * Includes the normalized header in the cache key 
           
          * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary 
           

           

          For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

           

          If you set this value to ``true`` , and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true`` , so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

           

          If both of these fields are ``false`` , then CloudFront treats the ``Accept-Encoding`` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request. By default, it’s not included in the cache key and it’s not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.

          

        
        - **EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

           

          This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingGzip`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true``  *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

           

           
          * Normalizes the value of the viewer’s ``Accept-Encoding`` header 
           
          * Includes the normalized header in the cache key 
           
          * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary 
           

           

          For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

           

          If you set this value to ``true`` , and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true`` , so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

           

          If both of these fields are ``false`` , then CloudFront treats the ``Accept-Encoding`` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request. By default, it’s not included in the cache key and it’s not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.

          

        
        - **HeadersConfig** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An object that determines whether any HTTP headers (and if so, which headers) are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

          

        
          - **HeaderBehavior** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Determines whether any HTTP headers are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:

             

             
            * ``none`` – HTTP headers are not included in the cache key and are not automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field is set to ``none`` , any headers that are listed in an ``OriginRequestPolicy``  *are* included in origin requests. 
             
            * ``whitelist`` – The HTTP headers that are listed in the ``Headers`` type are included in the cache key and are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. 
             

            

          
          - **Headers** *(dict) --* 

            Contains a list of HTTP header names.

            

          
            - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The number of header names in the ``Items`` list.

              

            
            - **Items** *(list) --* 

              A list of HTTP header names.

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
          
          
        
        - **CookiesConfig** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An object that determines whether any cookies in viewer requests (and if so, which cookies) are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

          

        
          - **CookieBehavior** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Determines whether any cookies in viewer requests are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:

             

             
            * ``none`` – Cookies in viewer requests are not included in the cache key and are not automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field is set to ``none`` , any cookies that are listed in an ``OriginRequestPolicy``  *are* included in origin requests. 
             
            * ``whitelist`` – The cookies in viewer requests that are listed in the ``CookieNames`` type are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

        - **QueryStringsConfig** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An object that determines whether any URL query strings in viewer requests (and if so, which query strings) are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

          

        
          - **QueryStringBehavior** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Determines whether any URL query strings in viewer requests are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:

             

             
            * ``none`` – Query strings in viewer requests are not included in the cache key and are not automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

            Contains the specific query strings in viewer requests that either * **are** * or * **are not** * included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. The behavior depends on whether the ``QueryStringBehavior`` field in the ``CachePolicyQueryStringsConfig`` type is set to ``whitelist`` (the listed query strings * **are** * included) or ``allExcept`` (the listed query strings * **are not** * included, but all other query strings are).

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **CachePolicy** *(dict) --* 

          A cache policy.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the cache policy.

            
          

          - **LastModifiedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time when the cache policy was last modified.

            
          

          - **CachePolicyConfig** *(dict) --* 

            The cache policy configuration.

            
            

            - **Comment** *(string) --* 

              A comment to describe the cache policy. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

              
            

            - **Name** *(string) --* 

              A unique name to identify the cache policy.

              
            

            - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

              The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value as the object’s time to live (TTL) only when the origin does *not* send ``Cache-Control`` or ``Expires`` headers with the object. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              The default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one day). If the value of ``MinTTL`` is more than 86400 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of ``MinTTL`` .

              
            

            - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

              The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value only when the origin sends ``Cache-Control`` or ``Expires`` headers with the object. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              The default value for this field is 31536000 seconds (one year). If the value of ``MinTTL`` or ``DefaultTTL`` is more than 31536000 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of ``DefaultTTL`` .

              
            

            - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* 

              The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
            

            - **ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin** *(dict) --* 

              The HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings to include in the cache key. The values included in the cache key are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

              
              

              - **EnableAcceptEncodingGzip** *(boolean) --* 

                A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 

                This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true``  *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

                 

                 
                * Normalizes the value of the viewer’s ``Accept-Encoding`` header 
                 
                * Includes the normalized header in the cache key 
                 
                * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary 
                 

                 

                For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you set this value to ``true`` , and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true`` , so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

                 

                If both of these fields are ``false`` , then CloudFront treats the ``Accept-Encoding`` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request. By default, it’s not included in the cache key and it’s not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.

                
              

              - **EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli** *(boolean) --* 

                A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 

                This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingGzip`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true``  *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

                 

                 
                * Normalizes the value of the viewer’s ``Accept-Encoding`` header 
                 
                * Includes the normalized header in the cache key 
                 
                * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary 
                 

                 

                For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you set this value to ``true`` , and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true`` , so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

                  * ``none`` – HTTP headers are not included in the cache key and are not automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field is set to ``none`` , any headers that are listed in an ``OriginRequestPolicy``  *are* included in origin requests. 
                   
                  * ``whitelist`` – The HTTP headers that are listed in the ``Headers`` type are included in the cache key and are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

  .. py:method:: create_cloud_front_origin_access_identity(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new origin access identity. If you're using Amazon S3 for your origin, you can use an origin access identity to require users to access your content using a CloudFront URL instead of the Amazon S3 URL. For more information about how to use origin access identities, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig={
              'CallerReference': 'string',

          }
      )
    :type CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig: dict
    :param CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The current configuration information for the identity.

      

    
      - **CallerReference** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

         

        If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig`` object), a new origin access identity is created.

         

        If the ``CallerReference`` is a value already sent in a previous identity request, and the content of the ``CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig`` is identical to the original request (ignoring white space), the response includes the same information returned to the original request. 

         

        If the ``CallerReference`` is a value you already sent in a previous request to create an identity, but the content of the ``CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig`` is different from the original request, CloudFront returns a ``CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityAlreadyExists`` error. 

        

      
      - **Comment** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A comment to describe the origin access identity. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

  .. py:method:: create_distribution(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new web distribution. You create a CloudFront distribution to tell CloudFront where you want content to be delivered from, and the details about how to track and manage content delivery. Send a ``POST`` request to the ``/*CloudFront API version* /distribution`` /``distribution ID`` resource.

     

    .. warning::

       

      When you update a distribution, there are more required fields than when you create a distribution. When you update your distribution by using `UpdateDistribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDistribution.html>`__ , follow the steps included in the documentation to get the current configuration and then make your updates. This helps to make sure that you include all of the required fields. To view a summary, see `Required Fields for Create Distribution and Update Distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-overview-required-fields.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

      )
    :type DistributionConfig: dict
    :param DistributionConfig: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The distribution's configuration information.

      

    
      - **CallerReference** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

         

        If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``DistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

         

        If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

        

      
      - **Aliases** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain names), if any, for this distribution.

        

      
        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

          

        
        - **Items** *(list) --* 

          A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
      - **DefaultRootObject** *(string) --* 

        The object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin (for example, ``index.html`` ) when a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution (``http://www.example.com`` ) instead of an object in your distribution (``http://www.example.com/product-description.html`` ). Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.

         

        Specify only the object name, for example, ``index.html`` . Don't add a ``/`` before the object name.

         

        If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a distribution, include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

         

        To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

         

        To replace the default root object, update the distribution configuration and specify the new object.

         

        For more information about the default root object, see `Creating a Default Root Object <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DefaultRootObject.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        

      
      - **Origins** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A complex type that contains information about origins for this distribution. 

        

      
        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The number of origins for this distribution.

          

        
        - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A list of origins.

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            An origin.

             

            An origin is the location where content is stored, and from which CloudFront gets content to serve to viewers. To specify an origin:

             

             
            * Use ``S3OriginConfig`` to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. 
             
            * Use ``CustomOriginConfig`` to specify all other kinds of origins, including: 

               
              * An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting 
               
              * An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer 
               
              * An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint 
               
              * An AWS Elemental MediaStore container 
               
              * Any other HTTP server, running on an Amazon EC2 instance or any other kind of host 
               

             
             

             

            For the current maximum number of origins that you can specify per distribution, see `General Quotas on Web Distributions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-web-distributions>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* (quotas were formerly referred to as limits).

            

          
            - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be unique within the distribution.

               

              Use this value to specify the ``TargetOriginId`` in a ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` .

              

            
            - **DomainName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The domain name for the origin.

               

              For more information, see `Origin Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesDomainName>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
            - **OriginPath** *(string) --* 

              An optional path that CloudFront appends to the origin domain name when CloudFront requests content from the origin.

               

              For more information, see `Origin Path <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginPath>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
            - **CustomHeaders** *(dict) --* 

              A list of HTTP header names and values that CloudFront adds to the requests that it sends to the origin.

               

              For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/add-origin-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The number of custom headers, if any, for this distribution.

                

              
              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                 **Optional** : A list that contains one ``OriginCustomHeader`` element for each custom header that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin. If Quantity is ``0`` , omit ``Items`` .

                

              
                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that contains ``HeaderName`` and ``HeaderValue`` elements, if any, for this distribution. 

                  

                
                  - **HeaderName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The name of a header that you want CloudFront to send to your origin. For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/forward-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    

                  
                  - **HeaderValue** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The value for the header that you specified in the ``HeaderName`` field.

                    

                  
                
            
            
            - **S3OriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

              Use this type to specify an origin that is an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. To specify any other type of origin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting, use the ``CustomOriginConfig`` type instead.

              

            
              - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the origin. Use an origin access identity to configure the origin so that viewers can *only* access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                 

                origin-access-identity/cloudfront/*ID-of-origin-access-identity*  

                 

                where `` *ID-of-origin-access-identity* `` is the value that CloudFront returned in the ``ID`` element when you created the origin access identity.

                 

                If you want viewers to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                 

                To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                 

                To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                 

                For more information about the origin access identity, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                

              
            
            - **CustomOriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

              Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the Amazon S3 bucket is configured with static website hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured with static website hosting, use the ``S3OriginConfig`` type instead.

              

            
              - **HTTPPort** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                A flag that specifies whether Origin Shield is enabled.

                 

                When it’s enabled, CloudFront routes all requests through Origin Shield, which can help protect your origin. When it’s disabled, CloudFront might send requests directly to your origin from multiple edge locations or regional edge caches.

                

              
              - **OriginShieldRegion** *(string) --* 

                The Region for Origin Shield.

                 

                Specify the Region that has the lowest latency to your origin. To specify a region, use the region code, not the region name. For example, specify the US East (Ohio) region as ``us-east-2`` .

                 

                When you enable CloudFront Origin Shield, you must specify the Region for Origin Shield. For the list of Regions that you can specify, and for help choosing the best Region for your origin, see `Choosing the Region for Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html#choose-origin-shield-region>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          - *(dict) --* 

            An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a second origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify. You create an origin group to support origin failover in CloudFront. When you create or update a distribution, you can specifiy the origin group instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover from the primary origin to the second origin under the failover conditions that you've chosen.

            

          
            - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The origin group's ID.

      - **DefaultCacheBehavior** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if files don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.

        

      
        - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.

          

        
        - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

          .. warning::

             

            We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

             

           

          A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

           

          When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          

        
          - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

            

          
          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The number of accounts in the list.

            

          
          - **Items** *(list) --* 

            A list of account identifiers.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
        - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

          A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

           

          When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          

        
          - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

            

          
          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The number of key groups in the list.

            

          
          - **Items** *(list) --* 

            A list of key groups identifiers.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
        - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

           

           
          * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
           
          * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. 
           
          * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). 
           

           

          For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

           

          .. note::

             

            The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

          

        
        - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

           

           
          * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
           
          * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
           
          * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
           

           

          If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

          

        
          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

            

          
          - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

             

             
            * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
             
            * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
             

             

            If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

            

          
            - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

              

            
            - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
          
          
        
        - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

          

        
        - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

          Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          

        
        - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

          

        
          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The number of Lambda@Edge function associations for this cache behavior.

            

          
          - **Items** *(list) --* 

             **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

            

          
            - *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

              

            
              - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                

              
              - **EventType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                 

                 
                * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                 
                * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                 
                * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                 
                * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache.

          - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

             

            If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

             

            If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

             

            If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

             

            If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

              Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

               

              If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

               

              For the current limit on the number of cookie names that you can whitelist for each cache behavior, see `CloudFront Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/xrefaws_service_limits.html#limits_cloudfront>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

          You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

          

        
        - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

          This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

           

          The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          

        
      
      - **CacheBehaviors** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements. 

        

      
        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The number of cache behaviors for this distribution. 

          

        
        - **Items** *(list) --* 

          Optional: A complex type that contains cache behaviors for this distribution. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.

             

            You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

             

            For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            If you don’t want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don’t include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

             

            To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

             

            To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

             

            For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            

          
            - **PathPattern** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

               

              .. note::

                 

                You can optionally include a slash (``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` .

                 

               

              The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.

               

              For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
            - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.

              

            
            - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

              .. warning::

                 

                We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                 

               

              A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

               

              When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                

              
              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The number of accounts in the list.

                

              
              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A list of account identifiers.

                

              
                - *(string) --* 

                
            
            
            - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

              A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

               

              When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                

              
              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The number of key groups in the list.

                

              
              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A list of key groups identifiers.

                

              
                - *(string) --* 

                
            
            
            - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

               

               
              * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
               
              * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  
               
              * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).  
               

               

              For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              .. note::

                 

                The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

              

            
            - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

               

               
              * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
               
              * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
               
              * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
               

               

              If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

              

            
              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                

              
              - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                

              
                - *(string) --* 

                
            
              - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                 

                 
                * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                 

                 

                If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                

              
                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                  

                
                - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                  

                
                  - *(string) --* 

                  
              
              
            
            - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

              Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

              

            
            - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

              Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true; if not, specify false. For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
            - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

              

            
              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                 **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                

              
                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                  

                
                  - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                    

                  
                  - **EventType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                     

                     
                    * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                     
                    * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                     
                    * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                     
                    * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                     

                    

                  
                  - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                    A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content. For more information, see `Accessing the Request Body by Choosing the Include Body Option <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-include-body-access.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

                    

                  
                
            
            
            - **FunctionAssociations** *(dict) --*

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A CloudFront function that is associated with a cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution.

                  

                
                  - **FunctionARN** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function.

                    

                  
                  - **EventType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The event type of the function, either ``viewer-request`` or ``viewer-response`` . You cannot use origin-facing event types (``origin-request`` and ``origin-response`` ) with a CloudFront function.

            - **ForwardedValues** *(dict) --* 

              This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Working with policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              A ``CacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` .

               

              A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

              

            
              - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                 

                If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                 

                If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                 

                If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                 

                If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                 

                For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                

              
              - **Cookies** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                 

                If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you want to send cookies to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                A complex type that specifies whether you want CloudFront to forward cookies to the origin and, if so, which ones. For more information about forwarding cookies to the origin, see `How CloudFront Forwards, Caches, and Logs Cookies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Cookies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the ``WhitelistedNames`` complex type.

                   

                  Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the ``Forward`` element.

                  

                
                - **WhitelistedNames** *(dict) --*

                  Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                   

                  If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

              The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

              

            
            - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

              This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer. 
         
        * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
         

         

        For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        

      
        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The number of HTTP status codes for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

          

        
        - **Items** *(list) --* 

          A complex type that contains a ``CustomErrorResponse`` element for each HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. 

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that controls:

             

             
            * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.  
             
            * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
             

             

            For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            

          
            - **ErrorCode** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

              

            
            - **ResponsePagePath** *(string) --* 

              The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

               

               
              * The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` .  
               
              * The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. 
               

               

              If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` .

               

              We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

              

            
            - **ResponseCode** *(string) --* 

              The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

               

               
              * Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. 
               
              * If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. 
               
              * You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. 
               

               

              If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .

              

            
            - **ErrorCachingMinTTL** *(integer) --* 

              The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode`` . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

               

              For more information, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
          
      
      
      - **Comment** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        An optional comment to describe the distribution. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

        

      
      - **Logging** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the distribution.

         

        For more information about logging, see `Access Logs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        

      
        - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify empty ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` , ``prefix`` , and ``IncludeCookies`` , the values are automatically deleted.

          

        
        - **IncludeCookies** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Specifies whether you want CloudFront to include cookies in access logs, specify ``true`` for ``IncludeCookies`` . If you choose to include cookies in logs, CloudFront logs all cookies regardless of how you configure the cache behaviors for this distribution. If you don't want to include cookies when you create a distribution or if you want to disable include cookies for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``IncludeCookies`` .

          

        
        - **Bucket** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

          

        
        - **Prefix** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log ``filenames`` for this distribution, for example, ``myprefix/`` . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an empty ``Prefix`` element in the ``Logging`` element.

          

        
      
      - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

        The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations.

         

        If you specify a price class other than ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower performance.

         

        For more information about price classes, see `Choosing the Price Class for a CloudFront Distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . For information about CloudFront pricing, including how price classes (such as Price Class 100) map to CloudFront regions, see `Amazon CloudFront Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/>`__ .

        

      
      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        From this field, you can enable or disable the selected distribution.

        

      
      - **ViewerCertificate** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that determines the distribution’s SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

        

      
        - **CloudFrontDefaultCertificate** *(boolean) --* 

          If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` .

           

          If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields:

           

           
          * ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
           
          * ``MinimumProtocolVersion``   
           
          * ``SSLSupportMethod``   
           

          

        
        - **IAMCertificateId** *(string) --* 

          If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate.

           

          If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . 

          

        
        - **ACMCertificateArn** *(string) --* 

          If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`__ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1`` ).

           

          If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` .

          

        
        - **SSLSupportMethod** *(string) --* 

          If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.

           

           
          * ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. 
           
          * ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don’t support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. 
           
          * ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ . 
           

           

          If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don’t set a value for this field.

          

        
        - **MinimumProtocolVersion** *(string) --* 

          If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

           

           
          * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. 
           
          * The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 
           

           

          For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`__ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

           

          .. note::

             

            On the CloudFront console, this setting is called **Security Policy** .

             

           

          When you’re using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher.

           

          If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

          

        
        - **Certificate** *(string) --* 

          This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

           

           
          * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
           
          * ``IAMCertificateId``   
           
          * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
           

          

        
        - **CertificateSource** *(string) --* 

          This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

           

           
          * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
           
          * ``IAMCertificateId``   
           
          * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
           

          

        
      
      - **Restrictions** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.

        

      
        - **GeoRestriction** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases.

          

        
          - **RestrictionType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

             

             
            * ``none`` : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location. 
             
            * ``blacklist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
             
            * ``whitelist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
             

            

          
          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            When geo restriction is ``enabled`` , this is the number of countries in your ``whitelist`` or ``blacklist`` . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , and you can omit ``Items`` .

            

          
          - **Items** *(list) --* 

            A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist`` ) or not distribute your content (``blacklist`` ).

             

            The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist`` . Include one ``Location`` element for each country.

             

            CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
      
      - **WebACLId** *(string) --* 

        A unique identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` . To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` .

         

        WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about WAF, see the `WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html>`__ . 

        

      
      - **HttpVersion** *(string) --* 

        (Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is http2. Viewers that don't support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

         

        For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLS 1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Identification (SNI).

         

        In general, configuring CloudFront to communicate with viewers using HTTP/2 reduces latency. You can improve performance by optimizing for HTTP/2. For more information, do an Internet search for "http/2 optimization." 

        

      
      - **IsIPV6Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

        If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify ``true`` . If you specify ``false`` , CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. 

         

        In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see `Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

         

        If you're using an Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true:

         

         
        * You enable IPv6 for the distribution 
         
        * You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects 
         

         

        For more information, see `Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration Developer Guide* .

         

        If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.

          - **DistributionConfig** *(dict) --* 

            The current configuration information for the distribution. Send a ``GET`` request to the ``/*CloudFront API version* /distribution ID/config`` resource.

            
            

            - **CallerReference** *(string) --* 

              A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

               

              If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``DistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

               

              If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

              
            

            - **Aliases** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain names), if any, for this distribution.

                A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
          
            

            - **DefaultRootObject** *(string) --* 

              The object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin (for example, ``index.html`` ) when a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution (``http://www.example.com`` ) instead of an object in your distribution (``http://www.example.com/product-description.html`` ). Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.

               

              Specify only the object name, for example, ``index.html`` . Don't add a ``/`` before the object name.

               

              If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a distribution, include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

               

              To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

               

              To replace the default root object, update the distribution configuration and specify the new object.

               

              For more information about the default root object, see `Creating a Default Root Object <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DefaultRootObject.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  - **Id** *(string) --* 

                    A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be unique within the distribution.

                     

                    Use this value to specify the ``TargetOriginId`` in a ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` .

                    
                  

                  - **DomainName** *(string) --* 

                    The domain name for the origin.

                    A list of HTTP header names and values that CloudFront adds to the requests that it sends to the origin.

                     

                    For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/add-origin-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of custom headers, if any, for this distribution.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                       **Optional** : A list that contains one ``OriginCustomHeader`` element for each custom header that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin. If Quantity is ``0`` , omit ``Items`` .

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A complex type that contains ``HeaderName`` and ``HeaderValue`` elements, if any, for this distribution.

                          The value for the header that you specified in the ``HeaderName`` field.

                          
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **S3OriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                    Use this type to specify an origin that is an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. To specify any other type of origin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting, use the ``CustomOriginConfig`` type instead.

                    
                    

                    - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

                      The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the origin. Use an origin access identity to configure the origin so that viewers can *only* access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                       

                      origin-access-identity/cloudfront/*ID-of-origin-access-identity*  

                       

                      where `` *ID-of-origin-access-identity* `` is the value that CloudFront returned in the ``ID`` element when you created the origin access identity.

                       

                      If you want viewers to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                       

                      To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                       

                      To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                       

                      For more information about the origin access identity, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the Amazon S3 bucket is configured with static website hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured with static website hosting, use the ``S3OriginConfig`` type instead.

                    
                    

                    - **HTTPPort** *(integer) --*

                  - **ConnectionTimeout** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of seconds that CloudFront waits when trying to establish a connection to the origin. The minimum timeout is 1 second, the maximum is 10 seconds, and the default (if you don’t specify otherwise) is 10 seconds.

                     

                    For more information, see `Origin Connection Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#origin-connection-timeout>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **OriginShield** *(dict) --* 

                    CloudFront Origin Shield. Using Origin Shield can help reduce the load on your origin.

                     

                    For more information, see `Using Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                      A flag that specifies whether Origin Shield is enabled.

                       

                      When it’s enabled, CloudFront routes all requests through Origin Shield, which can help protect your origin. When it’s disabled, CloudFront might send requests directly to your origin from multiple edge locations or regional edge caches.

                      
                    

                    - **OriginShieldRegion** *(string) --* 

                      The Region for Origin Shield.

                       

                      Specify the Region that has the lowest latency to your origin. To specify a region, use the region code, not the region name. For example, specify the US East (Ohio) region as ``us-east-2`` .

                       

                      When you enable CloudFront Origin Shield, you must specify the Region for Origin Shield. For the list of Regions that you can specify, and for help choosing the best Region for your origin, see `Choosing the Region for Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html#choose-origin-shield-region>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                The items (origin groups) in a distribution.

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a second origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify. You create an origin group to support origin failover in CloudFront. When you create or update a distribution, you can specifiy the origin group instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover from the primary origin to the second origin under the failover conditions that you've chosen.

                  
                  

                  - **Id** *(string) --*

                      The status codes that, when returned from the primary origin, will trigger CloudFront to failover to the second origin.

                      
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of status codes.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --*

            - **DefaultCacheBehavior** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if files don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.

              
              

              - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.

                
              

              - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                .. warning::

                   

                  We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                   

                 

                A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                 

                When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
                

                - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                  This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                  
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of accounts in the list.

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A list of account identifiers.

              - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                 

                When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
                

                - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                  This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                  
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of key groups in the list.

              - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                 

                 
                * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                 
                * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. 
                 
                * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). 
                 

                 

                For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                
              

              - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                 

                 
                * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                 

                 

                If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                   

                   
                  * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                   

                   

                  If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
            
              

              - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                
              

              - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
              

              - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of Lambda@Edge function associations for this cache behavior.

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                   **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --*

                    - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                      The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                      
                    

                    - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                      Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                   

                  If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy.

                  Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                   

                  If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                   

                  If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                   

                  If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

            - **CacheBehaviors** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements. 

              
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                The number of cache behaviors for this distribution. 

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                Optional: A complex type that contains cache behaviors for this distribution. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.

                   

                  You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

                   

                  For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  If you don’t want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don’t include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

                   

                  To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

                   

                  To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

                   

                  For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **PathPattern** *(string) --* 

                    The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      You can optionally include a slash (``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` .

                       

                     

                    The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.

                     

                    For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                    The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.

                    
                  

                  - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                    .. warning::

                       

                      We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                       

                     

                    A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                     

                    When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                      This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                      
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of accounts in the list.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A list of account identifiers.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
                  

                  - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                    A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                     

                    When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                      This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                      
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of key groups in the list.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A list of key groups identifiers.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
                  

                  - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                    The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                     

                     
                    * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                     
                    * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  
                     
                    * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).  
                     

                     

                    For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                    
                  

                  - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                     

                     
                    * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                     

                     

                    If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                    

                    - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                      A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                       

                       
                      * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                       
                      * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                       

                       

                      If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                      
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                    Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                    
                  

                  - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                    Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true; if not, specify false. For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of Lambda@Edge function associations for this cache behavior.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                       **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                        
                        

                        - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                          The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                          
                        

                        - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                          Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                           

                           
                          * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                           
                          * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                           
                          * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                           
                          * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                           

                          
                        

                        - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                          A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content. For more information, see `Accessing the Request Body by Choosing the Include Body Option <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-include-body-access.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

                          
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **FunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                    A list of CloudFront functions that are associated with this cache behavior. CloudFront functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --*

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      The CloudFront functions that are associated with a cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution. CloudFront functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A CloudFront function that is associated with a cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution.

                        
                        

                        - **FunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function.

                    - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                      This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                       

                      If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                       

                      If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                       

                      If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                       

                      If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                        Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                         

                        If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                A complex type that contains a ``CustomErrorResponse`` element for each HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. 

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls:

                   

                   
                  * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.  
                   
                  * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
                   

                   

                  For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **ErrorCode** *(integer) --* 

                    The HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                    
                  

                  - **ResponsePagePath** *(string) --* 

                    The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

                     

                     
                    * The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` .  
                     
                    * The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. 
                     

                     

                    If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` .

                     

                    We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

                    
                  

                  - **ResponseCode** *(string) --* 

                    The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

                     

                     
                    * Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. 
                     
                    * If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. 
                     
                    * You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. 
                     

                     

                    If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .

                    
                  

                  - **ErrorCachingMinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                    The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode`` . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

                     

                    For more information, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
              
            
          
            

            - **Comment** *(string) --* 

              An optional comment to describe the distribution. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

              
            

            - **Logging** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the distribution.

               

              For more information about logging, see `Access Logs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
              

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify empty ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` , ``prefix`` , and ``IncludeCookies`` , the values are automatically deleted.

                
              

              - **IncludeCookies** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether you want CloudFront to include cookies in access logs, specify ``true`` for ``IncludeCookies`` . If you choose to include cookies in logs, CloudFront logs all cookies regardless of how you configure the cache behaviors for this distribution. If you don't want to include cookies when you create a distribution or if you want to disable include cookies for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``IncludeCookies`` .

                
              

              - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

                
              

              - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

                An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log ``filenames`` for this distribution, for example, ``myprefix/`` . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an empty ``Prefix`` element in the ``Logging`` element.

                
          
            

            - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

              The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations.

               

              If you specify a price class other than ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower performance.

               

              For more information about price classes, see `Choosing the Price Class for a CloudFront Distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . For information about CloudFront pricing, including how price classes (such as Price Class 100) map to CloudFront regions, see `Amazon CloudFront Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/>`__ .

              
            

            - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              From this field, you can enable or disable the selected distribution.

              
            

            - **ViewerCertificate** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that determines the distribution’s SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

              
              

              - **CloudFrontDefaultCertificate** *(boolean) --* 

                If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` .

                 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields:

                 

                 
                * ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
                 
                * ``MinimumProtocolVersion``   
                 
                * ``SSLSupportMethod``   
                 

                
              

              - **IAMCertificateId** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate.

                 

                If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . 

                
              

              - **ACMCertificateArn** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`__ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1`` ).

                 

                If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` .

                
              

              - **SSLSupportMethod** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.

                 

                 
                * ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. 
                 
                * ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don’t support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. 
                 
                * ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ . 
                 

                 

                If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don’t set a value for this field.

                
              

              - **MinimumProtocolVersion** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

                 

                 
                * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. 
                 
                * The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 
                 

                 

                For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`__ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  On the CloudFront console, this setting is called **Security Policy** .

                   

                 

                When you’re using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher.

                 

                If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

                
              

              - **Certificate** *(string) --* 

                This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

                 

                 
                * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
                 
                * ``IAMCertificateId``   
                 
                * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
                 

                
              

              - **CertificateSource** *(string) --* 

                This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

                 

                 
                * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
                 
                * ``IAMCertificateId``   
                 
                * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
                 

                
          
            

            - **Restrictions** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.

              
              

              - **GeoRestriction** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases.

                
                

                - **RestrictionType** *(string) --* 

                  The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

                   

                   
                  * ``none`` : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location. 
                   
                  * ``blacklist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                   
                  * ``whitelist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                   

                  
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  When geo restriction is ``enabled`` , this is the number of countries in your ``whitelist`` or ``blacklist`` . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , and you can omit ``Items`` .

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist`` ) or not distribute your content (``blacklist`` ).

                   

                  The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist`` . Include one ``Location`` element for each country.

                   

                  CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
            
          
            

            - **WebACLId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` . To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` .

               

              WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about WAF, see the `WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html>`__ . 

              
            

            - **HttpVersion** *(string) --* 

              (Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is http2. Viewers that don't support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

               

              For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLS 1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Identification (SNI).

               

              In general, configuring CloudFront to communicate with viewers using HTTP/2 reduces latency. You can improve performance by optimizing for HTTP/2. For more information, do an Internet search for "http/2 optimization." 

              
            

            - **IsIPV6Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify ``true`` . If you specify ``false`` , CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. 

               

              In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see `Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              If you're using an Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true:

               

               
              * You enable IPv6 for the distribution 
               
              * You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects 
               

               

              For more information, see `Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration Developer Guide* .

               

              If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.

              
        
          

          - **AliasICPRecordals** *(list) --* 

            Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions.

             

            For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions. The status is returned in the CloudFront response; you can't configure it yourself.

               

              For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

              
              

              - **CNAME** *(string) --* 

                A domain name associated with a distribution. 

                
              

              - **ICPRecordalStatus** *(string) --* 

                The Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal status for a CNAME. The ICPRecordalStatus is set to APPROVED for all CNAMEs (aliases) in regions outside of China. 

                 

                The status values returned are the following:

                 

                 
                * **APPROVED** indicates that the associated CNAME has a valid ICP recordal number. Multiple CNAMEs can be associated with a distribution, and CNAMEs can correspond to different ICP recordals. To be marked as APPROVED, that is, valid to use with China region, a CNAME must have one ICP recordal number associated with it. 
                 
                * **SUSPENDED** indicates that the associated CNAME does not have a valid ICP recordal number. 
                 
                * **PENDING** indicates that CloudFront can't determine the ICP recordal status of the CNAME associated with the distribution because there was an error in trying to determine the status. You can try again to see if the error is resolved in which case CloudFront returns an APPROVED or SUSPENDED status. 
                 

                
          
        
      
        

        - **Location** *(string) --* 

          The fully qualified URI of the new distribution resource just created.

          
        

        - **ETag** *(string) --* 

          The current version of the distribution created.

      )
    :type DistributionConfigWithTags: dict
    :param DistributionConfigWithTags: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The distribution's configuration information. 

      

    
      - **DistributionConfig** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A distribution configuration.

        

      
        - **CallerReference** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

           

          If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``DistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

           

          If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

          

        
        - **Aliases** *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain names), if any, for this distribution.

          

        
          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

            

          
          - **Items** *(list) --* 

            A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
        - **DefaultRootObject** *(string) --* 

          The object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin (for example, ``index.html`` ) when a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution (``http://www.example.com`` ) instead of an object in your distribution (``http://www.example.com/product-description.html`` ). Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.

           

          Specify only the object name, for example, ``index.html`` . Don't add a ``/`` before the object name.

           

          If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a distribution, include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

           

          To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

           

          To replace the default root object, update the distribution configuration and specify the new object.

           

          For more information about the default root object, see `Creating a Default Root Object <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DefaultRootObject.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          

        
        - **Origins** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A complex type that contains information about origins for this distribution. 

          

        
          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The number of origins for this distribution.

            

          
          - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            A list of origins.

            

          
            - *(dict) --* 

              An origin.

               

              An origin is the location where content is stored, and from which CloudFront gets content to serve to viewers. To specify an origin:

               

               
              * Use ``S3OriginConfig`` to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. 
               
              * Use ``CustomOriginConfig`` to specify all other kinds of origins, including: 

                 
                * An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting 
                 
                * An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer 
                 
                * An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint 
                 
                * An AWS Elemental MediaStore container 
                 
                * Any other HTTP server, running on an Amazon EC2 instance or any other kind of host 
                 

               
               

               

              For the current maximum number of origins that you can specify per distribution, see `General Quotas on Web Distributions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-web-distributions>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* (quotas were formerly referred to as limits).

              

            
              - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be unique within the distribution.

                 

                Use this value to specify the ``TargetOriginId`` in a ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` .

                

              
              - **DomainName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The domain name for the origin.

                 

                For more information, see `Origin Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesDomainName>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                

              
              - **OriginPath** *(string) --* 

                An optional path that CloudFront appends to the origin domain name when CloudFront requests content from the origin.

                 

                For more information, see `Origin Path <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginPath>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                   **Optional** : A list that contains one ``OriginCustomHeader`` element for each custom header that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin. If Quantity is ``0`` , omit ``Items`` .

                  

                
                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that contains ``HeaderName`` and ``HeaderValue`` elements, if any, for this distribution.

              - **S3OriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                Use this type to specify an origin that is an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. To specify any other type of origin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting, use the ``CustomOriginConfig`` type instead.

                

              
                - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the origin. Use an origin access identity to configure the origin so that viewers can *only* access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                   

                  origin-access-identity/cloudfront/*ID-of-origin-access-identity*  

                   

                  where `` *ID-of-origin-access-identity* `` is the value that CloudFront returned in the ``ID`` element when you created the origin access identity.

                   

                  If you want viewers to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                   

                  To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                   

                  To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                   

                  For more information about the origin access identity, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        - **DefaultCacheBehavior** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if files don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.

          

        
          - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.

            

          
          - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

            .. warning::

            A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

             

            When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

            A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

             

            When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            

          
            - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

              

            
            - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            - **Items** *(list) --* 

              A list of key groups identifiers.

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
          
          
          - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

             

             
            * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
             
            * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. 
             
            * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). 
             

             

            For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            .. note::

               

              The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

            

          
          - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

             

             
            * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
             
            * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
             
            * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
             

             

            If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

            

          
            - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

              

            
            - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
          
            - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

               

               
              * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
               
              * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
               

               

              If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

              

            
              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                

              
              - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                

              
                - *(string) --* 

                
            
            
          
          - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

            Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

            

          
          - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

            Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

              

            
              - *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                

              
                - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                  

                
                - **EventType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                   

                   
                  * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                   
                  * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                   
                  * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                   
                  * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                   

                  

                
                - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --*

          - **ForwardedValues** *(dict) --* 

            This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Working with policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            A ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` .

             

            A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

            

          
            - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

               

              If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

               

              If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

               

              If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

               

              If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

               

              For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
            - **Cookies** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                If you want to send cookies to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the ``WhitelistedNames`` complex type.

                 

                Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the ``Forward`` element.

                

              
              - **WhitelistedNames** *(dict) --*

                If you want to send cookies to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                 

                If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                 

                For the current limit on the number of cookie names that you can whitelist for each cache behavior, see `CloudFront Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/xrefaws_service_limits.html#limits_cloudfront>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              A complex type that contains information about the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use for caching for this cache behavior.

              

            
              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The number of ``whitelisted`` query string parameters for a cache behavior.

                

              
              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A list that contains the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use as a basis for caching for a cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is 0, you can omit ``Items`` . 

                

              
                - *(string) --* 

                
            
            
          
          - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* 

            This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

            

          
          - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

            This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            

          
          - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

            This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            

          
        
        - **CacheBehaviors** *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements. 

          

        
          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The number of cache behaviors for this distribution. 

            

          
          - **Items** *(list) --* 

            Optional: A complex type that contains cache behaviors for this distribution. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

            

          
            - *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.

               

              You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

               

              For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              If you don’t want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don’t include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

               

              To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

               

              To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

               

              For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
              - **PathPattern** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  You can optionally include a slash (``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` .

                   

                 

                The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.

                 

                For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                

              
              - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.

                

              
              - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                .. warning::

                   

                  We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                   

                 

                A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                 

                When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                

              
                - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                  

                
                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The number of accounts in the list.

                  

                
                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A list of account identifiers.

                  

                
                  - *(string) --* 

                  
              
              
              - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                 

                When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                

              
                - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                  

                
                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The number of key groups in the list.

                  

                
                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A list of key groups identifiers.

                  

                
                  - *(string) --* 

                  
              
              
              - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                 

                 
                * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                 
                * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  
                 
                * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).  
                 

                 

                For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                

              
              - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                 

                 
                * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                 

                 

                If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                

              
                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                  

                
                - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                  

                
                  - *(string) --* 

                  
              
                - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                   

                   
                  * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                   

                   

                  If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                  

                
                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                    

                  
                  - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                    

                  
                    - *(string) --* 

                    
                
                
              
              - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                

              
              - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true; if not, specify false. For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                

              
              - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

                

              
                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The number of Lambda@Edge function associations for this cache behavior.

                  

                
                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                   **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                  

                
                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                    

                  
                    - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                      The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                      

                    
                    - **EventType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                      Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                       

                       
                      * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                       
                      * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                       
                      * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                       
                      * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                       

                      

                    
                    - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                      A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content.

                A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                

              
                - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                   

                  If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                   

                  If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                   

                  If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                   

                  If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                   

                  For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            A complex type that contains a ``CustomErrorResponse`` element for each HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. 

            

          
            - *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that controls:

               

               
              * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.  
               
              * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
               

               

              For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
              - **ErrorCode** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                

              
              - **ResponsePagePath** *(string) --* 

                The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

                 

                 
                * The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` .  
                 
                * The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. 
                 

                 

                If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` .

                 

                We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

                

              
              - **ResponseCode** *(string) --* 

                The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

                 

                 
                * Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. 
                 
                * If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. 
                 
                * You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. 
                 

                 

                If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .

                

              
              - **ErrorCachingMinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode`` . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

                 

                For more information, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                

              
            
        
        
        - **Comment** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An optional comment to describe the distribution. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

          

        
        - **Logging** *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the distribution.

           

          For more information about logging, see `Access Logs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          

        
          - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify empty ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` , ``prefix`` , and ``IncludeCookies`` , the values are automatically deleted.

            

          
          - **IncludeCookies** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Specifies whether you want CloudFront to include cookies in access logs, specify ``true`` for ``IncludeCookies`` . If you choose to include cookies in logs, CloudFront logs all cookies regardless of how you configure the cache behaviors for this distribution. If you don't want to include cookies when you create a distribution or if you want to disable include cookies for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``IncludeCookies`` .

            

          
          - **Bucket** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

            

          
          - **Prefix** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log ``filenames`` for this distribution, for example, ``myprefix/`` . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an empty ``Prefix`` element in the ``Logging`` element.

            

          
        
        - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

          The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations.

           

          If you specify a price class other than ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower performance.

           

          For more information about price classes, see `Choosing the Price Class for a CloudFront Distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . For information about CloudFront pricing, including how price classes (such as Price Class 100) map to CloudFront regions, see `Amazon CloudFront Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/>`__ .

          

        
        - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          From this field, you can enable or disable the selected distribution.

          

        
        - **ViewerCertificate** *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that determines the distribution’s SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

          

        
          - **CloudFrontDefaultCertificate** *(boolean) --* 

            If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` .

             

            If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields:

             

             
            * ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
             
            * ``MinimumProtocolVersion``   
             
            * ``SSLSupportMethod``   
             

            

          
          - **IAMCertificateId** *(string) --* 

            If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate.

             

            If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . 

            

          
          - **ACMCertificateArn** *(string) --* 

            If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`__ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1`` ).

             

            If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` .

            

          
          - **SSLSupportMethod** *(string) --* 

            If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.

             

             
            * ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. 
             
            * ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don’t support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. 
             
            * ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ . 
             

             

            If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don’t set a value for this field.

            

          
          - **MinimumProtocolVersion** *(string) --* 

            If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

             

             
            * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. 
             
            * The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 
             

             

            For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`__ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            .. note::

               

              On the CloudFront console, this setting is called **Security Policy** .

               

             

            When you’re using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher.

             

            If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

            

          
          - **Certificate** *(string) --* 

            This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

             

             
            * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
             
            * ``IAMCertificateId``   
             
            * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
             

            

          
          - **CertificateSource** *(string) --* 

            This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

             

             
            * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
             
            * ``IAMCertificateId``   
             
            * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
             

            

          
        
        - **Restrictions** *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.

          

        
          - **GeoRestriction** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases.

            

          
            - **RestrictionType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

               

               
              * ``none`` : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location. 
               
              * ``blacklist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
               
              * ``whitelist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
               

              

            
            - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              When geo restriction is ``enabled`` , this is the number of countries in your ``whitelist`` or ``blacklist`` . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , and you can omit ``Items`` .

              

            
            - **Items** *(list) --* 

              A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist`` ) or not distribute your content (``blacklist`` ).

               

              The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist`` . Include one ``Location`` element for each country.

               

              CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
          
          
        
        - **WebACLId** *(string) --* 

          A unique identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` . To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` .

           

          WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about WAF, see the `WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html>`__ . 

          

        
        - **HttpVersion** *(string) --* 

          (Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is http2. Viewers that don't support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

           

          For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLS 1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Identification (SNI).

           

          In general, configuring CloudFront to communicate with viewers using HTTP/2 reduces latency. You can improve performance by optimizing for HTTP/2. For more information, do an Internet search for "http/2 optimization." 

          

        
        - **IsIPV6Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

          If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify ``true`` . If you specify ``false`` , CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. 

           

          In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see `Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

           

          If you're using an Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true:

           

           
          * You enable IPv6 for the distribution 
           
          * You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects 
           

           

          For more information, see `Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration Developer Guide* .

           

          If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.

          

        
      
      - **Tags** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A complex type that contains zero or more ``Tag`` elements.

        

      
        - **Items** *(list) --* 

          A complex type that contains ``Tag`` elements.

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that contains ``Tag`` key and ``Tag`` value.

            

          
            - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              A string that contains ``Tag`` key.

               

              The string length should be between 1 and 128 characters. Valid characters include ``a-z`` , ``A-Z`` , ``0-9`` , space, and the special characters ``_ - . : / = + @`` .

              

            
            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              A string that contains an optional ``Tag`` value.

               

              The string length should be between 0 and 256 characters. Valid characters include ``a-z`` , ``A-Z`` , ``0-9`` , space, and the special characters ``_ - . : / = + @`` .

              - *(dict) --* 

                A list of identifiers for the public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies.

                
                

                - **KeyGroupId** *(string) --* 

                  The identifier of the key group that contains the public keys.

                  
                

                - **KeyPairIds** *(dict) --*

          - **DistributionConfig** *(dict) --* 

            The current configuration information for the distribution. Send a ``GET`` request to the ``/*CloudFront API version* /distribution ID/config`` resource.

            
            

            - **CallerReference** *(string) --* 

              A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

               

              If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``DistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

               

              If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

              
            

            - **Aliases** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain names), if any, for this distribution.

              
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
          
            

            - **DefaultRootObject** *(string) --* 

              The object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin (for example, ``index.html`` ) when a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution (``http://www.example.com`` ) instead of an object in your distribution (``http://www.example.com/product-description.html`` ). Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.

               

              Specify only the object name, for example, ``index.html`` . Don't add a ``/`` before the object name.

               

              If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a distribution, include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

               

              To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

               

              To replace the default root object, update the distribution configuration and specify the new object.

               

              For more information about the default root object, see `Creating a Default Root Object <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DefaultRootObject.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
            

            - **Origins** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains information about origins for this distribution. 

              
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                The number of origins for this distribution.

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --*

                  An origin is the location where content is stored, and from which CloudFront gets content to serve to viewers. To specify an origin:

                   

                   
                  * Use ``S3OriginConfig`` to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. 
                   
                  * Use ``CustomOriginConfig`` to specify all other kinds of origins, including: 

                     
                    * An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting 
                     
                    * An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer 
                     
                    * An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint 
                     
                    * An AWS Elemental MediaStore container 
                     
                    * Any other HTTP server, running on an Amazon EC2 instance or any other kind of host 
                     

                   
                   

                   

                  For the current maximum number of origins that you can specify per distribution, see `General Quotas on Web Distributions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-web-distributions>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* (quotas were formerly referred to as limits).

                  
                  

                  - **Id** *(string) --* 

                    A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be unique within the distribution.

                     

                    Use this value to specify the ``TargetOriginId`` in a ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` .

                    
                  

                  - **DomainName** *(string) --*

                    For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/add-origin-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of custom headers, if any, for this distribution.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                       **Optional** : A list that contains one ``OriginCustomHeader`` element for each custom header that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin. If Quantity is ``0`` , omit ``Items`` .

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --*

                          The value for the header that you specified in the ``HeaderName`` field.

                          
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **S3OriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                    Use this type to specify an origin that is an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. To specify any other type of origin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting, use the ``CustomOriginConfig`` type instead.

                    
                    

                    - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

                      The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the origin. Use an origin access identity to configure the origin so that viewers can *only* access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                       

                      origin-access-identity/cloudfront/*ID-of-origin-access-identity*  

                       

                      where `` *ID-of-origin-access-identity* `` is the value that CloudFront returned in the ``ID`` element when you created the origin access identity.

                       

                      If you want viewers to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                       

                      To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                       

                      To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                       

                      For more information about the origin access identity, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                
                  

                  - **CustomOriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                    Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the Amazon S3 bucket is configured with static website hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured with static website hosting, use the ``S3OriginConfig`` type instead.

                    
                    

                    - **HTTPPort** *(integer) --* 

                      The HTTP port that CloudFront uses to connect to the origin. Specify the HTTP port that the origin listens on.

                      * ``http-only`` – CloudFront always uses HTTP to connect to the origin. 
                       
                      * ``match-viewer`` – CloudFront connects to the origin using the same protocol that the viewer used to connect to CloudFront. 
                       
                      * ``https-only`` – CloudFront always uses HTTPS to connect to the origin. 
                       

                      
                    

                    - **OriginSslProtocols** *(dict) --*

                  - **OriginShield** *(dict) --* 

                    CloudFront Origin Shield. Using Origin Shield can help reduce the load on your origin.

                     

                    For more information, see `Using Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                      A flag that specifies whether Origin Shield is enabled.

                       

                      When it’s enabled, CloudFront routes all requests through Origin Shield, which can help protect your origin. When it’s disabled, CloudFront might send requests directly to your origin from multiple edge locations or regional edge caches.

                      
                    

                    - **OriginShieldRegion** *(string) --*

                  An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a second origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify. You create an origin group to support origin failover in CloudFront. When you create or update a distribution, you can specifiy the origin group instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover from the primary origin to the second origin under the failover conditions that you've chosen.

                  
                  

                  - **Id** *(string) --* 

                    The origin group's ID.

              A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if files don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.

              
              

              - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.

                
              

              - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                .. warning::

                   

                  We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                   

                 

                A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                 

                When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
                

                - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                  This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                  
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of accounts in the list.

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A list of account identifiers.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
            
              

              - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                 

                When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
                

                - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                  This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                  
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of key groups in the list.

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --*

              - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                 

                 
                * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                 
                * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. 
                 
                * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). 
                 

                 

                For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                
              

              - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                 

                 
                * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                 

                 

                If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                   

                   
                  * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                   

                   

                  If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
            
              

              - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                
              

              - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
              

              - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of Lambda@Edge function associations for this cache behavior.

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                   **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                    
                    

                    - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                      The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                      
                    

                    - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                      Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                       

                       
                      * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                       
                      * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                       
                      * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                       
                      * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                       

                      
                    

                    - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                      A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content. For more information, see `Accessing the Request Body by Choosing the Include Body Option <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-include-body-access.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

                      
                
              
            
              

              - **FunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                A list of CloudFront functions that are associated with this cache behavior. CloudFront functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --*

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A CloudFront function that is associated with a cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution.

                    
                    

                    - **FunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function.

                      
                    

                    - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                      The event type of the function, either ``viewer-request`` or ``viewer-response`` . You cannot use origin-facing event types (``origin-request`` and ``origin-response`` ) with a CloudFront function.

              - **ForwardedValues** *(dict) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Working with policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                A ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` .

                 

                A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                
                

                - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                   

                  If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                   

                  If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                   

                  If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                   

                  If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                   

                  For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                     

                    If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            - **CacheBehaviors** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements. 

              
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                The number of cache behaviors for this distribution. 

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                Optional: A complex type that contains cache behaviors for this distribution. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.

                   

                  You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

                   

                  For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  If you don’t want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don’t include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

                   

                  To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

                   

                  To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

                   

                  For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **PathPattern** *(string) --* 

                    The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      You can optionally include a slash (``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` .

                       

                     

                    The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.

                     

                    For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                    The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.

                    
                  

                  - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --*

                      We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                       

                     

                    A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                     

                    When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                    A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                     

                    When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature.

                    The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                     

                     
                    * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                     
                    * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  
                     
                    * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).  
                     

                     

                    For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                    
                  

                  - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                     

                     
                    * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                     

                     

                    If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                    

                    - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                      A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                       

                       
                      * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                       
                      * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                       

                       

                      If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                      
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                    Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                    
                  

                  - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                    Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true; if not, specify false. For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of Lambda@Edge function associations for this cache behavior.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                       **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                          The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                          
                        

                        - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                          Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                           

                           
                          * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                           
                          * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                           
                          * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                           
                          * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                           

                          
                        

                        - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                          A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content. For more information, see `Accessing the Request Body by Choosing the Include Body Option <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-include-body-access.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

                          
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **FunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                    A list of CloudFront functions that are associated with this cache behavior. CloudFront functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.

                  - **ForwardedValues** *(dict) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Working with policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    A ``CacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` .

                     

                    A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                    
                    

                    - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                      This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                       

                      If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                       

                      If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                       

                      If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                       

                      If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                       

                      For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                    

                    - **Cookies** *(dict) --* 

                      This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                       

                      If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy.

                        If you want to send cookies to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                         

                        Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the ``WhitelistedNames`` complex type.

                         

                        Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the ``Forward`` element.

                        Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                         

                        If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

              * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer. 
               
              * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
               

               

              For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                The number of HTTP status codes for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls:

                   

                   
                  * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.  
                   
                  * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
                   

                   

                  For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **ErrorCode** *(integer) --* 

                    The HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                    
                  

                  - **ResponsePagePath** *(string) --* 

                    The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

                     

                     
                    * The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` .  
                     
                    * The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. 
                     

                     

                    If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` .

                     

                    We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

                    
                  

                  - **ResponseCode** *(string) --* 

                    The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

                     

                     
                    * Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. 
                     
                    * If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. 
                     
                    * You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. 
                     

                     

                    If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .

                    
                  

                  - **ErrorCachingMinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                    The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode`` . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

                     

                    For more information, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
              
            
          
            

            - **Comment** *(string) --* 

              An optional comment to describe the distribution. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

              
            

            - **Logging** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the distribution.

               

              For more information about logging, see `Access Logs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
              

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify empty ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` , ``prefix`` , and ``IncludeCookies`` , the values are automatically deleted.

                
              

              - **IncludeCookies** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether you want CloudFront to include cookies in access logs, specify ``true`` for ``IncludeCookies`` . If you choose to include cookies in logs, CloudFront logs all cookies regardless of how you configure the cache behaviors for this distribution. If you don't want to include cookies when you create a distribution or if you want to disable include cookies for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``IncludeCookies`` .

                
              

              - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

                
              

              - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

                An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log ``filenames`` for this distribution, for example, ``myprefix/`` . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an empty ``Prefix`` element in the ``Logging`` element.

                
          
            

            - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

              The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations.

               

              If you specify a price class other than ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower performance.

               

              For more information about price classes, see `Choosing the Price Class for a CloudFront Distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              From this field, you can enable or disable the selected distribution.

              
            

            - **ViewerCertificate** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that determines the distribution’s SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

              
              

              - **CloudFrontDefaultCertificate** *(boolean) --* 

                If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` .

                 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields:

                 

                 
                * ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
                 
                * ``MinimumProtocolVersion``   
                 
                * ``SSLSupportMethod``   
                 

                
              

              - **IAMCertificateId** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate.

                 

                If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . 

                
              

              - **ACMCertificateArn** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`__ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1`` ).

                 

                If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` .

                
              

              - **SSLSupportMethod** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.

                 

                 
                * ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. 
                 
                * ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don’t support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. 
                 
                * ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ . 
                 

                 

                If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don’t set a value for this field.

                
              

              - **MinimumProtocolVersion** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

                 

                 
                * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. 
                 
                * The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 
                 

                 

                For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`__ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  On the CloudFront console, this setting is called **Security Policy** .

                   

                 

                When you’re using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher.

                 

                If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

                
              

              - **Certificate** *(string) --* 

                This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

                 

                 
                * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
                 
                * ``IAMCertificateId``   
                 
                * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
                 

                
              

              - **CertificateSource** *(string) --* 

                This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

                 

                 
                * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
                 
                * ``IAMCertificateId``   
                 
                * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
                 

                
          
            

            - **Restrictions** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.

              
              

              - **GeoRestriction** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases.

                
                

                - **RestrictionType** *(string) --* 

                  The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

                   

                   
                  * ``none`` : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location. 
                   
                  * ``blacklist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                   
                  * ``whitelist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                   

                  
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  When geo restriction is ``enabled`` , this is the number of countries in your ``whitelist`` or ``blacklist`` . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , and you can omit ``Items`` .

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist`` ) or not distribute your content (``blacklist`` ).

                   

                  The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist`` . Include one ``Location`` element for each country.

                   

                  CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
            
          
            

            - **WebACLId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` . To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` .

               

              WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about WAF, see the `WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html>`__ . 

              
            

            - **HttpVersion** *(string) --* 

              (Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is http2. Viewers that don't support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

               

              For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLS 1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Identification (SNI).

               

              In general, configuring CloudFront to communicate with viewers using HTTP/2 reduces latency. You can improve performance by optimizing for HTTP/2. For more information, do an Internet search for "http/2 optimization." 

              
            

            - **IsIPV6Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify ``true`` . If you specify ``false`` , CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. 

               

              In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see `Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              If you're using an Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true:

               

               
              * You enable IPv6 for the distribution 
               
              * You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects 
               

               

              For more information, see `Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration Developer Guide* .

               

              If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.

              
        
          

          - **AliasICPRecordals** *(list) --* 

            Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions.

             

            For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions. The status is returned in the CloudFront response; you can't configure it yourself.

               

              For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

              
              

              - **CNAME** *(string) --* 

                A domain name associated with a distribution. 

                
              

              - **ICPRecordalStatus** *(string) --* 

                The Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal status for a CNAME. The ICPRecordalStatus is set to APPROVED for all CNAMEs (aliases) in regions outside of China. 

                 

                The status values returned are the following:

                 

                 
                * **APPROVED** indicates that the associated CNAME has a valid ICP recordal number. Multiple CNAMEs can be associated with a distribution, and CNAMEs can correspond to different ICP recordals. To be marked as APPROVED, that is, valid to use with China region, a CNAME must have one ICP recordal number associated with it. 
                 
                * **SUSPENDED** indicates that the associated CNAME does not have a valid ICP recordal number. 
                 
                * **PENDING** indicates that CloudFront can't determine the ICP recordal status of the CNAME associated with the distribution because there was an error in trying to determine the status. You can try again to see if the error is resolved in which case CloudFront returns an APPROVED or SUSPENDED status. 
                 

                
          
        
      
        

        - **Location** *(string) --* 

          The fully qualified URI of the new distribution resource just created.

          
        

        - **ETag** *(string) --* 

          The current version of the distribution created.

  .. py:method:: create_function(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a CloudFront function.

     

    To create a function, you provide the function code and some configuration information about the function. The response contains an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the function.

     

    When you create a function, it’s in the ``DEVELOPMENT`` stage. In this stage, you can test the function with ``TestFunction`` , and update it with ``UpdateFunction`` .

     

    When you’re ready to use your function with a CloudFront distribution, use ``PublishFunction`` to copy the function from the ``DEVELOPMENT`` stage to ``LIVE`` . When it’s live, you can attach the function to a distribution’s cache behavior, using the function’s ARN.

        A complex type that contains information about the objects that you want to invalidate.

          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
      - **CallerReference** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A value that you specify to uniquely identify an invalidation request. CloudFront uses the value to prevent you from accidentally resubmitting an identical request. Whenever you create a new invalidation request, you must specify a new value for ``CallerReference`` and change other values in the request as applicable. One way to ensure that the value of ``CallerReference`` is unique is to use a ``timestamp`` , for example, ``20120301090000`` .

         

        If you make a second invalidation request with the same value for ``CallerReference`` , and if the rest of the request is the same, CloudFront doesn't create a new invalidation request. Instead, CloudFront returns information about the invalidation request that you previously created with the same ``CallerReference`` .

         

        If ``CallerReference`` is a value you already sent in a previous invalidation batch request but the content of any ``Path`` is different from the original request, CloudFront returns an ``InvalidationBatchAlreadyExists`` error.

                The number of invalidation paths specified for the objects that you want to invalidate.

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A complex type that contains a list of the paths that you want to invalidate.

            - **CallerReference** *(string) --* 

              A value that you specify to uniquely identify an invalidation request. CloudFront uses the value to prevent you from accidentally resubmitting an identical request. Whenever you create a new invalidation request, you must specify a new value for ``CallerReference`` and change other values in the request as applicable. One way to ensure that the value of ``CallerReference`` is unique is to use a ``timestamp`` , for example, ``20120301090000`` .

               

              If you make a second invalidation request with the same value for ``CallerReference`` , and if the rest of the request is the same, CloudFront doesn't create a new invalidation request. Instead, CloudFront returns information about the invalidation request that you previously created with the same ``CallerReference`` .

               

              If ``CallerReference`` is a value you already sent in a previous invalidation batch request but the content of any ``Path`` is different from the original request, CloudFront returns an ``InvalidationBatchAlreadyExists`` error.

  .. py:method:: create_key_group(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a key group that you can use with `CloudFront signed URLs and signed cookies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ .

     

    To create a key group, you must specify at least one public key for the key group. After you create a key group, you can reference it from one or more cache behaviors. When you reference a key group in a cache behavior, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

  .. py:method:: create_origin_request_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an origin request policy.

     

    After you create an origin request policy, you can attach it to one or more cache behaviors. When it’s attached to a cache behavior, the origin request policy determines the values that CloudFront includes in requests that it sends to the origin. Each request that CloudFront sends to the origin includes the following:

     

     
    * The request body and the URL path (without the domain name) from the viewer request. 
     
    * The headers that CloudFront automatically includes in every origin request, including ``Host`` , ``User-Agent`` , and ``X-Amz-Cf-Id`` . 
     
    * All HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings that are specified in the cache policy or the origin request policy. These can include items from the viewer request and, in the case of headers, additional ones that are added by CloudFront. 
     

     

    CloudFront sends a request when it can’t find a valid object in its cache that matches the request. If you want to send values to the origin and also include them in the cache key, use ``CachePolicy`` .

     

    For more information about origin request policies, see `Controlling origin requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

      )
    :type StreamingDistributionConfig: dict
    :param StreamingDistributionConfig: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The streaming distribution's configuration information.

      

    
      - **CallerReference** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

         

        If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``StreamingDistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

         

        If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

        

      
      - **S3Origin** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A complex type that contains information about the Amazon S3 bucket from which you want CloudFront to get your media files for distribution. 

        

      
        - **DomainName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin. 

          

        
        - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the distribution. Use an origin access identity to configure the distribution so that end users can only access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

           

          If you want end users to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

           

          To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

           

          To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

           

          For more information, see `Using an Origin Access Identity to Restrict Access to Your Amazon S3 Content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          

        
      
      - **Aliases** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain names), if any, for this streaming distribution. 

        

      
        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

          

        
        - **Items** *(list) --* 

          A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
      - **Comment** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Any comments you want to include about the streaming distribution. 

        

      
      - **Logging** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the streaming distribution. 

        

      
        - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a streaming distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing streaming distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify ``empty Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` , the values are automatically deleted. 

          

        
        - **Bucket** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

          

        
        - **Prefix** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log filenames for this streaming distribution, for example, ``myprefix/`` . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an empty ``Prefix`` element in the ``Logging`` element.

          

        
      
      - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A complex type that specifies any accounts that you want to permit to create signed URLs for private content. If you want the distribution to use signed URLs, include this element; if you want the distribution to use public URLs, remove this element. For more information, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . 

        

      
        - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

          

        
        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The number of accounts in the list.

          

        
        - **Items** *(list) --*

    :type StreamingDistributionConfigWithTags: dict
    :param StreamingDistributionConfigWithTags: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The streaming distribution's configuration information. 

      

    
      - **StreamingDistributionConfig** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A streaming distribution Configuration.

        

      
        - **CallerReference** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

           

          If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``StreamingDistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

           

          If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

          

        
        - **S3Origin** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A complex type that contains information about the Amazon S3 bucket from which you want CloudFront to get your media files for distribution.

            The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin. 

            

          
          - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the distribution. Use an origin access identity to configure the distribution so that end users can only access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

             

            If you want end users to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

             

            To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

             

            To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

            The ``Signer`` complex type lists the account number of the trusted signer or ``self`` if the signer is the account that created the distribution. The ``Signer`` element also includes the IDs of any active CloudFront key pairs that are associated with the trusted signer's account. If no ``KeyPairId`` element appears for a ``Signer`` , that signer can't create signed URLs.

             

            For more information, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the distribution. Use an origin access identity to configure the distribution so that end users can only access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

                 

                If you want end users to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                 

                To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                 

                To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

If you don't want to enable logging when you create a streaming distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing streaming distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify ``empty Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` , the values are automatically deleted. 

                
              

              - **Bucket** *(string) --*

  .. py:method:: delete_origin_request_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes an origin request policy.

     

    You cannot delete an origin request policy if it’s attached to any cache behaviors. First update your distributions to remove the origin request policy from all cache behaviors, then delete the origin request policy.

     

    To delete an origin request policy, you must provide the policy’s identifier and version. To get the identifier, you can use ``ListOriginRequestPolicies`` or ``GetOriginRequestPolicy`` .

  .. py:method:: delete_streaming_distribution(**kwargs)

    

    Delete a streaming distribution. To delete an RTMP distribution using the CloudFront API, perform the following steps.

     

     **To delete an RTMP distribution using the CloudFront API** :

     

     
    * Disable the RTMP distribution. 
     
    * Submit a ``GET Streaming Distribution Config`` request to get the current configuration and the ``Etag`` header for the distribution.  
     
    * Update the XML document that was returned in the response to your ``GET Streaming Distribution Config`` request to change the value of ``Enabled`` to ``false`` . 
     
    * Submit a ``PUT Streaming Distribution Config`` request to update the configuration for your distribution. In the request body, include the XML document that you updated in Step 3. Then set the value of the HTTP ``If-Match`` header to the value of the ``ETag`` header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the ``GET Streaming Distribution Config`` request in Step 2. 
     
    * Review the response to the ``PUT Streaming Distribution Config`` request to confirm that the distribution was successfully disabled. 
     
    * Submit a ``GET Streaming Distribution Config`` request to confirm that your changes have propagated. When propagation is complete, the value of ``Status`` is ``Deployed`` . 
     
    * Submit a ``DELETE Streaming Distribution`` request. Set the value of the HTTP ``If-Match`` header to the value of the ``ETag`` header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the ``GET Streaming Distribution Config`` request in Step 2. 
     
    * Review the response to your ``DELETE Streaming Distribution`` request to confirm that the distribution was successfully deleted.

              - **EnableAcceptEncodingGzip** *(boolean) --* 

                A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 

                This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true``  *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

                 

                 
                * Normalizes the value of the viewer’s ``Accept-Encoding`` header 
                 
                * Includes the normalized header in the cache key 
                 
                * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary 
                 

                 

                For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you set this value to ``true`` , and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true`` , so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

By default, it’s not included in the cache key and it’s not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.

  .. py:method:: get_cache_policy_config(**kwargs)

    

    Gets a cache policy configuration.

     

    To get a cache policy configuration, you must provide the policy’s identifier. If the cache policy is attached to a distribution’s cache behavior, you can get the policy’s identifier using ``ListDistributions`` or ``GetDistribution`` . If the cache policy is not attached to a cache behavior, you can get the identifier using ``ListCachePolicies`` .

          - **Comment** *(string) --* 

            A comment to describe the cache policy. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            A unique name to identify the cache policy.

            
          

          - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

            The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value as the object’s time to live (TTL) only when the origin does *not* send ``Cache-Control`` or ``Expires`` headers with the object. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            The default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one day). If the value of ``MinTTL`` is more than 86400 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of ``MinTTL`` .

            
          

          - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

            The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value only when the origin sends ``Cache-Control`` or ``Expires`` headers with the object. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            The default value for this field is 31536000 seconds (one year). If the value of ``MinTTL`` or ``DefaultTTL`` is more than 31536000 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of ``DefaultTTL`` .

            
          

          - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* 

            The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            - **EnableAcceptEncodingGzip** *(boolean) --* 

              A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

               

              This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true``  *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

               

               
              * Normalizes the value of the viewer’s ``Accept-Encoding`` header 
               
              * Includes the normalized header in the cache key 
               
              * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary

              If you set this value to ``true`` , and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true`` , so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

               

              If both of these fields are ``false`` , then CloudFront treats the ``Accept-Encoding`` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request. By default, it’s not included in the cache key and it’s not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.

              * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary 
               

               

              For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              If you set this value to ``true`` , and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true`` , so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

               

              If both of these fields are ``false`` , then CloudFront treats the ``Accept-Encoding`` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request. By default, it’s not included in the cache key and it’s not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.

              
            

            - **HeadersConfig** *(dict) --*

              A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

               

              If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``DistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

               

              If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

                A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
          
            

            - **DefaultRootObject** *(string) --* 

              The object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin (for example, ``index.html`` ) when a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution (``http://www.example.com`` ) instead of an object in your distribution (``http://www.example.com/product-description.html`` ). Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.

               

              Specify only the object name, for example, ``index.html`` . Don't add a ``/`` before the object name.

               

              If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a distribution, include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

               

              To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

               

              To replace the default root object, update the distribution configuration and specify the new object.

               

              For more information about the default root object, see `Creating a Default Root Object <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DefaultRootObject.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  * Use ``S3OriginConfig`` to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. 
                   
                  * Use ``CustomOriginConfig`` to specify all other kinds of origins, including: 

                     
                    * An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting 
                     
                    * An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer

                    A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be unique within the distribution.

                     

                    Use this value to specify the ``TargetOriginId`` in a ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` .

                    
                  

                  - **DomainName** *(string) --* 

                    The domain name for the origin.

                    A list of HTTP header names and values that CloudFront adds to the requests that it sends to the origin.

                     

                    For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/add-origin-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of custom headers, if any, for this distribution.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                       **Optional** : A list that contains one ``OriginCustomHeader`` element for each custom header that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin. If Quantity is ``0`` , omit ``Items`` .

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A complex type that contains ``HeaderName`` and ``HeaderValue`` elements, if any, for this distribution.

For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/forward-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                          
                        

                        - **HeaderValue** *(string) --* 

                          The value for the header that you specified in the ``HeaderName`` field.

                          
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **S3OriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                    Use this type to specify an origin that is an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. To specify any other type of origin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting, use the ``CustomOriginConfig`` type instead.

                    
                    

                    - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

                      The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the origin. Use an origin access identity to configure the origin so that viewers can *only* access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                       

                      origin-access-identity/cloudfront/*ID-of-origin-access-identity*  

                       

                      where `` *ID-of-origin-access-identity* `` is the value that CloudFront returned in the ``ID`` element when you created the origin access identity.

                       

                      If you want viewers to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                       

                      To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                       

                      To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                       

                      For more information about the origin access identity, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                
                  

                  - **CustomOriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                    Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the Amazon S3 bucket is configured with static website hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured with static website hosting, use the ``S3OriginConfig`` type instead.

                    
                    

                    - **HTTPPort** *(integer) --*

                  An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a second origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify. You create an origin group to support origin failover in CloudFront. When you create or update a distribution, you can specifiy the origin group instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover from the primary origin to the second origin under the failover conditions that you've chosen.

                  
                  

                  - **Id** *(string) --*

                When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                 

                 
                * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                 
                * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. 
                 
                * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). 
                 

                 

                For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                
              

              - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                 

                 
                * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                 

                 

                If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                   

                   
                  * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                   

                   

                  If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
            
              

              - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                
              

              - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
              

              - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                   **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                    
                    

                    - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                      The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                      
                    

                    - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                      Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                       

                       
                      * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                       
                      * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                       
                      * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                       
                      * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                       

                      
                    

                    - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                      A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content. For more information, see `Accessing the Request Body by Choosing the Include Body Option <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-include-body-access.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

                      
                
              
            
              

              - **FunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                A list of CloudFront functions that are associated with this cache behavior. CloudFront functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --*

                    - **FunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function.

                      
                    

                    - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                      The event type of the function, either ``viewer-request`` or ``viewer-response`` . You cannot use origin-facing event types (``origin-request`` and ``origin-response`` ) with a CloudFront function.

              - **CachePolicyId** *(string) --* 

                The unique identifier of the cache policy that is attached to the default cache behavior. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                A ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` .

                
              

              - **OriginRequestPolicyId** *(string) --*

              - **ForwardedValues** *(dict) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Working with policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                A ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` .

                 

                A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                
                

                - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                   

                  If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                   

                  If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                   

                  If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                   

                  If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                   

                  For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                

                - **Cookies** *(dict) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                   

                  If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  A complex type that specifies whether you want CloudFront to forward cookies to the origin and, if so, which ones. For more information about forwarding cookies to the origin, see `How CloudFront Forwards, Caches, and Logs Cookies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Cookies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **Forward** *(string) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                     

                    If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    If you want to send cookies to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use origin request policy.

                    Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the ``WhitelistedNames`` complex type.

                     

                    Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the ``Forward`` element.

                    
                  

                  - **WhitelistedNames** *(dict) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                     

                    If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                     

                    If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                     

                    For the current limit on the number of cookie names that you can whitelist for each cache behavior, see `CloudFront Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/xrefaws_service_limits.html#limits_cloudfront>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --*

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A list of cookie names.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
              
                

                - **Headers** *(dict) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                   

                  If you want to include headers in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  If you want to send headers to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  A complex type that specifies the ``Headers`` , if any, that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior (whitelisted headers). For the headers that you specify, CloudFront also caches separate versions of a specified object that is based on the header values in viewer requests.

                   

                  For more information, see `Caching Content Based on Request Headers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/header-caching.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of header names in the ``Items`` list.

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A list of HTTP header names.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
                

                - **QueryStringCacheKeys** *(dict) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                   

                  If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  A complex type that contains information about the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use for caching for this cache behavior.

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of ``whitelisted`` query string parameters for a cache behavior.

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A list that contains the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use as a basis for caching for a cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is 0, you can omit ``Items`` . 

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
            
              

              - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

                
              

              - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
              

              - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
          
            

            - **CacheBehaviors** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements. 

              
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                The number of cache behaviors for this distribution. 

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                Optional: A complex type that contains cache behaviors for this distribution. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.

                   

                  You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

                   

                  For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  If you don’t want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don’t include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

                   

                  To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

                   

                  To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

                   

                  For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **PathPattern** *(string) --* 

                    The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      You can optionally include a slash (``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` .

                       

                     

                    The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.

                     

                    For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                    The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.

                    
                  

                  - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                    .. warning::

                       

                      We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                       

                     

                    A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                     

                    When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                      This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                      
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of accounts in the list.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A list of account identifiers.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
                  

                  - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                    A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                     

                    When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                      This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                      
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of key groups in the list.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A list of key groups identifiers.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
                  

                  - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                    The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                     

                     
                    * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                     
                    * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  
                     
                    * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).  
                     

                     

                    For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                    
                  

                  - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                     

                     
                    * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                     

                     

                    If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                    

                    - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                      A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                       

                       
                      * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                       
                      * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                       

                       

                      If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly.

                          * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                           
                          * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute.

                    If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                      This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                       

                      If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                       

                      If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                       

                      If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                       

                      If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                       

                      For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                        Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the ``WhitelistedNames`` complex type.

                         

                        Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the ``Forward`` element.

                        
                      

                      - **WhitelistedNames** *(dict) --* 

                        This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                        Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                         

                        If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                         

                        For the current limit on the number of cookie names that you can whitelist for each cache behavior, see `CloudFront Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/xrefaws_service_limits.html#limits_cloudfront>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

                    - **QueryStringCacheKeys** *(dict) --* 

                      This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                       

                      If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      A complex type that contains information about the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use for caching for this cache behavior.

                      
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of ``whitelisted`` query string parameters for a cache behavior.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A list that contains the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use as a basis for caching for a cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is 0, you can omit ``Items`` . 

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

                    
                  

                  - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects.

            - **CustomErrorResponses** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that controls the following:

               

               
              * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer. 
               
              * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
               

               

              For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                The number of HTTP status codes for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A complex type that contains a ``CustomErrorResponse`` element for each HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. 

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls:

                   

                   
                  * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.  
                   
                  * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
                   

                   

                  For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **ErrorCode** *(integer) --* 

                    The HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                    
                  

                  - **ResponsePagePath** *(string) --* 

                    The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

                     

                     
                    * The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` .  
                     
                    * The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. 
                     

                     

                    If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` .

                     

                    We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

                    
                  

                  - **ResponseCode** *(string) --* 

                    The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

                     

                     
                    * Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. 
                     
                    * If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. 
                     
                    * You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. 
                     

                     

                    If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .

                    
                  

                  - **ErrorCachingMinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                    The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode`` . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

                     

                    For more information, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
              
            
          
            

            - **Comment** *(string) --* 

              An optional comment to describe the distribution. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

              
            

            - **Logging** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the distribution.

               

              For more information about logging, see `Access Logs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
              

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify empty ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` , ``prefix`` , and ``IncludeCookies`` , the values are automatically deleted.

                
              

              - **IncludeCookies** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether you want CloudFront to include cookies in access logs, specify ``true`` for ``IncludeCookies`` . If you choose to include cookies in logs, CloudFront logs all cookies regardless of how you configure the cache behaviors for this distribution. If you don't want to include cookies when you create a distribution or if you want to disable include cookies for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``IncludeCookies`` .

                
              

              - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

                
              

              - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

                An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log ``filenames`` for this distribution, for example, ``myprefix/`` . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an empty ``Prefix`` element in the ``Logging`` element.

                
          
            

            - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

              The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations.

               

              If you specify a price class other than ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower performance.

               

              For more information about price classes, see `Choosing the Price Class for a CloudFront Distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . For information about CloudFront pricing, including how price classes (such as Price Class 100) map to CloudFront regions, see `Amazon CloudFront Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/>`__ .

              
            

            - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              From this field, you can enable or disable the selected distribution.

              
            

            - **ViewerCertificate** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that determines the distribution’s SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

              
              

              - **CloudFrontDefaultCertificate** *(boolean) --* 

                If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` .

                 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields:

                 

                 
                * ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
                 
                * ``MinimumProtocolVersion``   
                 
                * ``SSLSupportMethod``   
                 

                
              

              - **IAMCertificateId** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate.

                 

                If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . 

                
              

              - **ACMCertificateArn** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`__ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1`` ).

                 

                If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` .

                
              

              - **SSLSupportMethod** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.

                 

                 
                * ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. 
                 
                * ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don’t support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. 
                 
                * ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ . 
                 

                 

                If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don’t set a value for this field.

                
              

              - **MinimumProtocolVersion** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

                 

                 
                * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. 
                 
                * The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 
                 

                 

                For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`__ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  On the CloudFront console, this setting is called **Security Policy** .

                   

                 

                When you’re using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher.

                 

                If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

            - **Restrictions** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.

              
              

              - **GeoRestriction** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases.

                
                

                - **RestrictionType** *(string) --* 

                  The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

                   

                   
                  * ``none`` : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location. 
                   
                  * ``blacklist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                   
                  * ``whitelist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                   

                  
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  When geo restriction is ``enabled`` , this is the number of countries in your ``whitelist`` or ``blacklist`` . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , and you can omit ``Items`` .

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist`` ) or not distribute your content (``blacklist`` ).

                   

                  The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist`` . Include one ``Location`` element for each country.

                   

                  CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
            
          
            

            - **WebACLId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` . To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` .

               

              WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about WAF, see the `WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html>`__ . 

              
            

            - **HttpVersion** *(string) --* 

              (Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is http2. Viewers that don't support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

               

              For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLS 1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Identification (SNI).

               

              In general, configuring CloudFront to communicate with viewers using HTTP/2 reduces latency. You can improve performance by optimizing for HTTP/2. For more information, do an Internet search for "http/2 optimization." 

              
            

            - **IsIPV6Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify ``true`` . If you specify ``false`` , CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. 

               

              In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see `Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              If you're using an Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true:

               

               
              * You enable IPv6 for the distribution 
               
              * You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects 
               

               

              For more information, see `Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration Developer Guide* .

               

              If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.

              
        
          

          - **AliasICPRecordals** *(list) --* 

            Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions.

             

            For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions. The status is returned in the CloudFront response; you can't configure it yourself.

               

              For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

              
              

              - **CNAME** *(string) --* 

                A domain name associated with a distribution. 

                
              

              - **ICPRecordalStatus** *(string) --* 

                The Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal status for a CNAME. The ICPRecordalStatus is set to APPROVED for all CNAMEs (aliases) in regions outside of China. 

                 

                The status values returned are the following:

                 

                 
                * **APPROVED** indicates that the associated CNAME has a valid ICP recordal number. Multiple CNAMEs can be associated with a distribution, and CNAMEs can correspond to different ICP recordals. To be marked as APPROVED, that is, valid to use with China region, a CNAME must have one ICP recordal number associated with it. 
                 
                * **SUSPENDED** indicates that the associated CNAME does not have a valid ICP recordal number. 
                 
                * **PENDING** indicates that CloudFront can't determine the ICP recordal status of the CNAME associated with the distribution because there was an error in trying to determine the status. You can try again to see if the error is resolved in which case CloudFront returns an APPROVED or SUSPENDED status. 
                 

                
          
        
      
        

        - **ETag** *(string) --* 

          The current version of the distribution's information. For example: ``E2QWRUHAPOMQZL`` .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        The returned result of the corresponding request.

        
        

        - **DistributionConfig** *(dict) --* 

          The distribution's configuration information.

          
          

          - **CallerReference** *(string) --* 

            A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

             

            If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``DistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

             

            If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

            
          

          - **Aliases** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain names), if any, for this distribution.

            
            

            - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

              The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

              
            

            - **Items** *(list) --* 

              A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
        
          

          - **DefaultRootObject** *(string) --* 

            The object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin (for example, ``index.html`` ) when a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution (``http://www.example.com`` ) instead of an object in your distribution (``http://www.example.com/product-description.html`` ). Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.

             

            Specify only the object name, for example, ``index.html`` . Don't add a ``/`` before the object name.

             

            If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a distribution, include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

             

            To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

             

            To replace the default root object, update the distribution configuration and specify the new object.

             

            For more information about the default root object, see `Creating a Default Root Object <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DefaultRootObject.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            
          

          - **Origins** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that contains information about origins for this distribution. 

            
            

            - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

              The number of origins for this distribution.

              
            

            - **Items** *(list) --* 

              A list of origins.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                An origin.

                 

                An origin is the location where content is stored, and from which CloudFront gets content to serve to viewers. To specify an origin:

                 

                 
                * Use ``S3OriginConfig`` to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. 
                 
                * Use ``CustomOriginConfig`` to specify all other kinds of origins, including: 

                   
                  * An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting 
                   
                  * An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer 
                   
                  * An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint 
                   
                  * An AWS Elemental MediaStore container 
                   
                  * Any other HTTP server, running on an Amazon EC2 instance or any other kind of host

                  - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

                    The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the origin. Use an origin access identity to configure the origin so that viewers can *only* access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                     

                    origin-access-identity/cloudfront/*ID-of-origin-access-identity*  

                     

                    where `` *ID-of-origin-access-identity* `` is the value that CloudFront returned in the ``ID`` element when you created the origin access identity.

                     

                    If you want viewers to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                     

                    To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                     

                    To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                     

                    For more information about the origin access identity, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

               

              When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
              

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                The number of key groups in the list.

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A list of key groups identifiers.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
          
            

            - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

              The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

               

               
              * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
               
              * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. 
               
              * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). 
               

               

              For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              .. note::

                 

                The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

              
            

            - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

               

               
              * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
               
              * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
               
              * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
               

               

              If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

              
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                 

                 
                * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                 

                 

                If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
            
          
            

            - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

              Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

              
            

            - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

              Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
            

            - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                  
                  

                  - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                    The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                    
                  

                  - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                    Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                     

                     
                    * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                     
                    * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                     
                    * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                     
                    * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                     

                    
                  

                  - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                    A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content. For more information, see `Accessing the Request Body by Choosing the Include Body Option <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-include-body-access.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A CloudFront function that is associated with a cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution.

                  
                  

                  - **FunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function.

                    
                  

                  - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                    The event type of the function, either ``viewer-request`` or ``viewer-response`` . You cannot use origin-facing event types (``origin-request`` and ``origin-response`` ) with a CloudFront function.

            - **ForwardedValues** *(dict) --* 

              This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Working with policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

              
              

              - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                 

                If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy.

                Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                 

                If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                 

                If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                 

                If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                 

                For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
              

              - **Cookies** *(dict) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                 

                If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  If you want to send cookies to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the ``WhitelistedNames`` complex type.

                   

                  Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the ``Forward`` element.

                  
                

                - **WhitelistedNames** *(dict) --*

A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                   

                  If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                   

                  For the current limit on the number of cookie names that you can whitelist for each cache behavior, see `CloudFront Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/xrefaws_service_limits.html#limits_cloudfront>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of cookie names in the ``Items`` list.

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A list of cookie names.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
            
              

              - **Headers** *(dict) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                 

                If you want to include headers in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you want to send headers to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                A complex type that specifies the ``Headers`` , if any, that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior (whitelisted headers). For the headers that you specify, CloudFront also caches separate versions of a specified object that is based on the header values in viewer requests.

                 

                For more information, see `Caching Content Based on Request Headers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/header-caching.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of header names in the ``Items`` list.

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A list of HTTP header names.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
            
              

              - **QueryStringCacheKeys** *(dict) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                 

                If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                A complex type that contains information about the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use for caching for this cache behavior.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of ``whitelisted`` query string parameters for a cache behavior.

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A list that contains the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use as a basis for caching for a cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is 0, you can omit ``Items`` . 

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
            
          
            

            - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* 

              This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

              
            

            - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

              This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
            

            - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

              This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
        
          

          - **CacheBehaviors** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements. 

            
            

            - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

              The number of cache behaviors for this distribution. 

              
            

            - **Items** *(list) --* 

              Optional: A complex type that contains cache behaviors for this distribution. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.

                 

                You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

                 

                For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you don’t want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don’t include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

                 

                To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

                 

                To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

                 

                For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
                

                - **PathPattern** *(string) --* 

                  The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    You can optionally include a slash (``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` .

                     

                   

                  The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.

                   

                  For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                

                - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                  The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.

                  
                

                - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                  .. warning::

                     

                    We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                     

                   

                  A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                   

                  When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                    
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of accounts in the list.

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A list of account identifiers.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
                

                - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                  A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                   

                  When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                    
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of key groups in the list.

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A list of key groups identifiers.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
                

                - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                  The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                   

                   
                  * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                   
                  * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  
                   
                  * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).  
                   

                   

                  For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                  
                

                - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                   

                   
                  * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                   

                   

                  If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
                  

                  - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                     

                     
                    * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                     

                     

                    If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses.

                  - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                     

                    If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy.

                    Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                     

                    If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                     

                    If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                     

                    If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                     

                    For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the ``WhitelistedNames`` complex type.

                       

                      Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the ``Forward`` element.

                      
                    

                    - **WhitelistedNames** *(dict) --* 

                      This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                      Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                       

                      If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                    If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    A complex type that contains information about the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use for caching for this cache behavior.

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of ``whitelisted`` query string parameters for a cache behavior.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A list that contains the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use as a basis for caching for a cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is 0, you can omit ``Items`` . 

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
              
                

                - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

                  
                

                - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                

                - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
            
          
        
          

          - **CustomErrorResponses** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that controls the following:

             

             
            * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer. 
             
            * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
             

             

            For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            
            

            - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

              The number of HTTP status codes for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

              
            

            - **Items** *(list) --* 

              A complex type that contains a ``CustomErrorResponse`` element for each HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. 

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls:

                 

                 
                * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.  
                 
                * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
                 

                 

                For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
                

                - **ErrorCode** *(integer) --* 

                  The HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                  
                

                - **ResponsePagePath** *(string) --* 

                  The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

                   

                   
                  * The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` .  
                   
                  * The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. 
                   

                   

                  If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` .

                   

                  We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

                  
                

                - **ResponseCode** *(string) --* 

                  The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

                   

                   
                  * Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. 
                   
                  * If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. 
                   
                  * You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. 
                   

                   

                  If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .

                  
                

                - **ErrorCachingMinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                  The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode`` . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

                   

                  For more information, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
            
          
        
          

          - **Comment** *(string) --* 

            An optional comment to describe the distribution. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

            
          

          - **Logging** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the distribution.

             

            For more information about logging, see `Access Logs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            
            

            - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify empty ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` , ``prefix`` , and ``IncludeCookies`` , the values are automatically deleted.

              
            

            - **IncludeCookies** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether you want CloudFront to include cookies in access logs, specify ``true`` for ``IncludeCookies`` . If you choose to include cookies in logs, CloudFront logs all cookies regardless of how you configure the cache behaviors for this distribution. If you don't want to include cookies when you create a distribution or if you want to disable include cookies for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``IncludeCookies`` .

              
            

            - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

              
            

            - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

              An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log ``filenames`` for this distribution, for example, ``myprefix/`` . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an empty ``Prefix`` element in the ``Logging`` element.

              
        
          

          - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

            The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations.

             

            If you specify a price class other than ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower performance.

             

            For more information about price classes, see `Choosing the Price Class for a CloudFront Distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . For information about CloudFront pricing, including how price classes (such as Price Class 100) map to CloudFront regions, see `Amazon CloudFront Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/>`__ .

            
          

          - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

            From this field, you can enable or disable the selected distribution.

            
          

          - **ViewerCertificate** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that determines the distribution’s SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

            
            

            - **CloudFrontDefaultCertificate** *(boolean) --* 

              If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` .

               

              If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields:

               

               
              * ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
               
              * ``MinimumProtocolVersion``   
               
              * ``SSLSupportMethod``   
               

              
            

            - **IAMCertificateId** *(string) --* 

              If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate.

               

              If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . 

              
            

            - **ACMCertificateArn** *(string) --* 

              If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`__ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1`` ).

               

              If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` .

              
            

            - **SSLSupportMethod** *(string) --* 

              If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.

               

               
              * ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. 
               
              * ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don’t support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. 
               
              * ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ . 
               

               

              If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don’t set a value for this field.

              
            

            - **MinimumProtocolVersion** *(string) --* 

              If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

               

               
              * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. 
               
              * The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 
               

               

              For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`__ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              .. note::

                 

                On the CloudFront console, this setting is called **Security Policy** .

                 

               

              When you’re using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher.

               

              If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

              
            

            - **Certificate** *(string) --* 

              This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

               

               
              * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
               
              * ``IAMCertificateId``   
               
              * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
               

              
            

            - **CertificateSource** *(string) --* 

              This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

               

               
              * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
               
              * ``IAMCertificateId``   
               
              * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
               

              
        
          

          - **Restrictions** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.

            
            

            - **GeoRestriction** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases.

              
              

              - **RestrictionType** *(string) --* 

                The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

                 

                 
                * ``none`` : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location. 
                 
                * ``blacklist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                 
                * ``whitelist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                 

                
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                When geo restriction is ``enabled`` , this is the number of countries in your ``whitelist`` or ``blacklist`` . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , and you can omit ``Items`` .

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist`` ) or not distribute your content (``blacklist`` ).

                 

                The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist`` . Include one ``Location`` element for each country.

                 

                CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
          
        
          

          - **WebACLId** *(string) --* 

            A unique identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` . To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` .

             

            WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about WAF, see the `WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html>`__ . 

            
          

          - **HttpVersion** *(string) --* 

            (Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is http2. Viewers that don't support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

             

            For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLS 1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Identification (SNI).

             

            In general, configuring CloudFront to communicate with viewers using HTTP/2 reduces latency. You can improve performance by optimizing for HTTP/2. For more information, do an Internet search for "http/2 optimization." 

            
          

          - **IsIPV6Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

            If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify ``true`` . If you specify ``false`` , CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. 

             

            In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see `Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            If you're using an Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true:

             

             
            * You enable IPv6 for the distribution 
             
            * You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects 
             

             

            For more information, see `Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration Developer Guide* .

             

            If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.

            
      
        

        - **ETag** *(string) --* 

          The current version of the configuration. For example: ``E2QWRUHAPOMQZL`` .

            - **Paths** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains information about the objects that you want to invalidate. For more information, see `Specifying the Objects to Invalidate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Invalidation.html#invalidation-specifying-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . 

              
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                The number of invalidation paths specified for the objects that you want to invalidate.

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A complex type that contains a list of the paths that you want to invalidate.

            - **CallerReference** *(string) --* 

              A value that you specify to uniquely identify an invalidation request. CloudFront uses the value to prevent you from accidentally resubmitting an identical request. Whenever you create a new invalidation request, you must specify a new value for ``CallerReference`` and change other values in the request as applicable. One way to ensure that the value of ``CallerReference`` is unique is to use a ``timestamp`` , for example, ``20120301090000`` .

               

              If you make a second invalidation request with the same value for ``CallerReference`` , and if the rest of the request is the same, CloudFront doesn't create a new invalidation request. Instead, CloudFront returns information about the invalidation request that you previously created with the same ``CallerReference`` .

               

              If ``CallerReference`` is a value you already sent in a previous invalidation batch request but the content of any ``Path`` is different from the original request, CloudFront returns an ``InvalidationBatchAlreadyExists`` error.

              If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``StreamingDistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

               

              If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

              
            

            - **S3Origin** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains information about the Amazon S3 bucket from which you want CloudFront to get your media files for distribution. 

              
              

              - **DomainName** *(string) --*

              - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

                The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the distribution. Use an origin access identity to configure the distribution so that end users can only access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

                 

                If you want end users to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                 

                To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                 

                To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                 

                For more information, see `Using an Origin Access Identity to Restrict Access to Your Amazon S3 Content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
          
            

            - **Aliases** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain names), if any, for this streaming distribution. 

              
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --*

                Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a streaming distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing streaming distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify ``empty Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` , the values are automatically deleted. 

                
              

              - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        The returned result of the corresponding request.

        
        

        - **StreamingDistributionConfig** *(dict) --* 

          The streaming distribution's configuration information.

          
          

          - **CallerReference** *(string) --* 

            A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

             

            If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``StreamingDistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

             

            If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

            
          

          - **S3Origin** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that contains information about the Amazon S3 bucket from which you want CloudFront to get your media files for distribution. 

            
            

            - **DomainName** *(string) --* 

              The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin. 

              
            

            - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

              The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the distribution. Use an origin access identity to configure the distribution so that end users can only access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

               

              If you want end users to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

               

              To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

               

              To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

               

              For more information, see `Using an Origin Access Identity to Restrict Access to Your Amazon S3 Content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            - **Items** *(list) --* 

              A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
        
          

          - **Comment** *(string) --* 

            Any comments you want to include about the streaming distribution.

            - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a streaming distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing streaming distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify ``empty Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` , the values are automatically deleted. 

              
            

            - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

              
            

            - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

              An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log filenames for this streaming distribution, for example, ``myprefix/`` . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an empty ``Prefix`` element in the ``Logging`` element.

              
        
          

          - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that specifies any accounts that you want to permit to create signed URLs for private content. If you want the distribution to use signed URLs, include this element; if you want the distribution to use public URLs, remove this element. For more information, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . 

            
            

            - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

              
            

            - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

              The number of accounts in the list.

              
            

            - **Items** *(list) --* 

              A list of account identifiers.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
        
          

          - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

            A complex type that contains information about price class for this streaming distribution. 

            
          

          - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

            Whether the streaming distribution is enabled to accept user requests for content.

  .. py:method:: get_waiter(waiter_name)

        
    Returns an object that can wait for some condition.
    
    :type waiter_name: str
    :param waiter_name: The name of the waiter to get. See the waiters
        section of the service docs for a list of available waiters.
    
    :returns: The specified waiter object.
    :rtype: botocore.waiter.Waiter


  .. py:method:: list_cache_policies(**kwargs)

    

    Gets a list of cache policies.

     

    You can optionally apply a filter to return only the managed policies created by Amazon Web Services, or only the custom policies created in your account.

     

    You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the ``NextMarker`` value from the current response as the ``Marker`` value in the subsequent request.

                    The HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings to include in the cache key. The values included in the cache key are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                    
                    

                    - **EnableAcceptEncodingGzip** *(boolean) --* 

                      A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                       

                      This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true``  *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

                       

                       
                      * Normalizes the value of the viewer’s ``Accept-Encoding`` header 
                       
                      * Includes the normalized header in the cache key 
                       
                      * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary 
                       

                       

                      For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      If you set this value to ``true`` , and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true`` , so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

                       

                      If both of these fields are ``false`` , then CloudFront treats the ``Accept-Encoding`` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request. By default, it’s not included in the cache key and it’s not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.

  .. py:method:: list_conflicting_aliases(**kwargs)

    

    Gets a list of aliases (also called CNAMEs or alternate domain names) that conflict or overlap with the provided alias, and the associated CloudFront distributions and Amazon Web Services accounts for each conflicting alias. In the returned list, the distribution and account IDs are partially hidden, which allows you to identify the distributions and accounts that you own, but helps to protect the information of ones that you don’t own.

     

    Use this operation to find aliases that are in use in CloudFront that conflict or overlap with the provided alias. For example, if you provide ``www.example.com`` as input, the returned list can include ``www.example.com`` and the overlapping wildcard alternate domain name (``*.example.com`` ), if they exist. If you provide ``*.example.com`` as input, the returned list can include ``*.example.com`` and any alternate domain names covered by that wildcard (for example, ``www.example.com`` , ``test.example.com`` , ``dev.example.com`` , and so on), if they exist.

     

    To list conflicting aliases, you provide the alias to search and the ID of a distribution in your account that has an attached SSL/TLS certificate that includes the provided alias. For more information, including how to set up the distribution and certificate, see `Moving an alternate domain name to a different distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html#alternate-domain-names-move>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

     

    You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the ``NextMarker`` value from the current response as the ``Marker`` value in the subsequent request.

      The alias (also called a CNAME) to search for conflicting aliases.

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in the list of conflicting aliases. The response includes conflicting aliases in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next page of the list, set this field’s value to the value of ``NextMarker`` from the current page’s response.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **ConflictingAliasesList** *(dict) --* 

          A list of conflicting aliases.

          
          

          - **NextMarker** *(string) --* 

            If there are more items in the list than are in this response, this element is present. It contains the value that you should use in the ``Marker`` field of a subsequent request to continue listing conflicting aliases where you left off.

            
          

          - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

            The maximum number of conflicting aliases requested.

            
          

          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

            The number of conflicting aliases returned in the response.

            
          

          - **Items** *(list) --* 

            Contains the conflicting aliases in the list.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              An alias (also called a CNAME) and the CloudFront distribution and Amazon Web Services account ID that it’s associated with. The distribution and account IDs are partially hidden, which allows you to identify the distributions and accounts that you own, but helps to protect the information of ones that you don’t own.

              
              

              - **Alias** *(string) --* 

                An alias (also called a CNAME).

                
              

              - **DistributionId** *(string) --* 

                The (partially hidden) ID of the CloudFront distribution associated with the alias.

                
              

              - **AccountId** *(string) --* 

                The (partially hidden) ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the distribution that’s associated with the alias.

                    * Use ``S3OriginConfig`` to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. 
                     
                    * Use ``CustomOriginConfig`` to specify all other kinds of origins, including: 

                       
                      * An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting 
                       
                      * An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer 
                       
                      * An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint 
                       
                      * An AWS Elemental MediaStore container 
                       
                      * Any other HTTP server, running on an Amazon EC2 instance or any other kind of host 
                       

                     
                     

                     

                    For the current maximum number of origins that you can specify per distribution, see `General Quotas on Web Distributions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-web-distributions>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* (quotas were formerly referred to as limits).

                    
                    

                    - **Id** *(string) --* 

                      A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be unique within the distribution.

                       

                      Use this value to specify the ``TargetOriginId`` in a ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` .

                      
                    

                    - **DomainName** *(string) --* 

                      The domain name for the origin.

                       

                      For more information, see `Origin Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesDomainName>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                    

                    - **OriginPath** *(string) --*

                        The number of custom headers, if any, for this distribution.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                         **Optional** : A list that contains one ``OriginCustomHeader`` element for each custom header that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin. If Quantity is ``0`` , omit ``Items`` .

                        
                        

                        - *(dict) --* 

                          A complex type that contains ``HeaderName`` and ``HeaderValue`` elements, if any, for this distribution. 

                          
                          

                          - **HeaderName** *(string) --* 

                            The name of a header that you want CloudFront to send to your origin. For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/forward-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                            
                          

                          - **HeaderValue** *(string) --* 

                            The value for the header that you specified in the ``HeaderName`` field.

                            
                      
                    
                  
                    

                    - **S3OriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                      Use this type to specify an origin that is an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. To specify any other type of origin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting, use the ``CustomOriginConfig`` type instead.

                      
                      

                      - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

                        The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the origin. Use an origin access identity to configure the origin so that viewers can *only* access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                         

                        origin-access-identity/cloudfront/*ID-of-origin-access-identity*  

                         

                        where `` *ID-of-origin-access-identity* `` is the value that CloudFront returned in the ``ID`` element when you created the origin access identity.

                         

                        If you want viewers to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                         

                        To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                         

                        To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                         

                        For more information about the origin access identity, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                        
                  
                    

                    - **CustomOriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                      Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the Amazon S3 bucket is configured with static website hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured with static website hosting, use the ``S3OriginConfig`` type instead.

                      
                      

                      - **HTTPPort** *(integer) --* 

                        The HTTP port that CloudFront uses to connect to the origin. Specify the HTTP port that the origin listens on.

                        
                      

                      - **HTTPSPort** *(integer) --*

                        * ``http-only`` – CloudFront always uses HTTP to connect to the origin. 
                         
                        * ``match-viewer`` – CloudFront connects to the origin using the same protocol that the viewer used to connect to CloudFront. 
                         
                        * ``https-only`` – CloudFront always uses HTTPS to connect to the origin. 
                         

                        
                      

                      - **OriginSslProtocols** *(dict) --* 

                        Specifies the minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront uses when connecting to your origin over HTTPS. Valid values include ``SSLv3`` , ``TLSv1`` , ``TLSv1.1`` , and ``TLSv1.2`` .

                         

                        For more information, see `Minimum Origin SSL Protocol <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginSSLProtocols>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a second origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify. You create an origin group to support origin failover in CloudFront. When you create or update a distribution, you can specifiy the origin group instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover from the primary origin to the second origin under the failover conditions that you've chosen.

                    
                    

                    - **Id** *(string) --*

                        Items (origins) in an origin group.

                        
                        

                        - *(dict) --* 

                          An origin in an origin group.

                          
                          

                          - **OriginId** *(string) --* 

                            The ID for an origin in an origin group.

                            
                      
                    
                  
                
              
            
              

              - **DefaultCacheBehavior** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if files don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.

                
                

                - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                  The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.

                  
                

                - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                  .. warning::

                     

                    We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                     

                   

                  A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                   

                  When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                    
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of accounts in the list.

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A list of account identifiers.

                - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                  A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                   

                  When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                    
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of key groups in the list.

                - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                  The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                   

                   
                  * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                   
                  * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. 
                   
                  * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). 
                   

                   

                  For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                  
                

                - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                   

                   
                  * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                   

                   

                  If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
                  

                  - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                     

                     
                    * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                     

                     

                    If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
              
                

                - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                  Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                  
                

                - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                  Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                        The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                        
                      

                      - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                        Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                         

                         
                        * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                         
                        * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                         
                        * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                         
                        * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                         

                        
                      

                      - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                        A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content.

                  A ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` .

                   

                  A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                  
                  

                  - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                     

                    If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy.

                    Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                     

                    If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                     

                    If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                     

                    If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                      Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                       

                      If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

                  The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects.

              - **CacheBehaviors** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of cache behaviors for this distribution. 

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  Optional: A complex type that contains cache behaviors for this distribution. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.

                     

                    You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

                     

                    For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    If you don’t want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don’t include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

                     

                    To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

                     

                    To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

                     

                    For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **PathPattern** *(string) --* 

                      The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        You can optionally include a slash (``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` .

                         

                       

                      The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.

                       

                      For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                    

                    - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                      The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.

                      
                    

                    - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                      .. warning::

                         

                        We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                         

                       

                      A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                       

                      When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                      

                      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                        This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                        
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of accounts in the list.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A list of account identifiers.

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                  
                    

                    - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                      A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                       

                      When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                      

                      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                        This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                        
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of key groups in the list.

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                  
                    

                    - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                      The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                       

                       
                      * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                       
                      * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  
                       
                      * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).  
                       

                       

                      For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                         

                      
                    

                    - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                      A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                       

                       
                      * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                       
                      * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                       
                      * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                       

                       

                      If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                      
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                      

                      - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                        A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                         

                         
                        * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                         
                        * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                         

                         

                        If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                        
                        

                        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                          The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                          
                        

                        - **Items** *(list) --* 

                          A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                          
                          

                          - *(string) --* 
                      
                    
                  
                    

                    - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                      Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                      
                    

                    - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                      Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true; if not, specify false. For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of Lambda@Edge function associations for this cache behavior.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                         **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                        
                        

                        - *(dict) --*

                            * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                             
                            * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                             
                            * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                             
                            * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute.

                      - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                        This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                         

                        If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                         

                        If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                         

                        Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                         

                        If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                         

                        If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                         

                        If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                           

                          If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls:

                     

                     
                    * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.  
                     
                    * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
                     

                     

                    For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **ErrorCode** *(integer) --* 

                      The HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                      
                    

                    - **ResponsePagePath** *(string) --* 

                      The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

                       

                       
                      * The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` .  
                       
                      * The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. 
                       

                       

                      If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` .

                       

                      We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

                      
                    

                    - **ResponseCode** *(string) --* 

                      The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

                       

                       
                      * Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. 
                       
                      * If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. 
                       
                      * You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. 
                       

                       

                      If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .

                      
                    

                    - **ErrorCachingMinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                      The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode`` . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

                       

                      For more information, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                
              
            
              

              - **Comment** *(string) --* 

                The comment originally specified when this distribution was created.

                
              

              - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

                A complex type that contains information about price class for this streaming distribution. 

                
              

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether the distribution is enabled to accept user requests for content.

                
              

              - **ViewerCertificate** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that determines the distribution’s SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

                
                

                - **CloudFrontDefaultCertificate** *(boolean) --* 

                  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` .

                   

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields:

                   

                   
                  * ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
                   
                  * ``MinimumProtocolVersion``   
                   
                  * ``SSLSupportMethod``   
                   

                  
                

                - **IAMCertificateId** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate.

                   

                  If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . 

                  
                

                - **ACMCertificateArn** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`__ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1`` ).

                   

                  If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` .

                  
                

                - **SSLSupportMethod** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.

                   

                   
                  * ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. 
                   
                  * ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don’t support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. 
                   
                  * ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ . 
                   

                   

                  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don’t set a value for this field.

                  
                

                - **MinimumProtocolVersion** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

                   

                   
                  * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. 
                   
                  * The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 
                   

                   

                  For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`__ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    On the CloudFront console, this setting is called **Security Policy** .

                     

                   

                  When you’re using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher.

                   

                  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

                  
                

                - **Certificate** *(string) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

                  * ``IAMCertificateId``   
                   
                  * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
                   

                  
                

                - **CertificateSource** *(string) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

                   

                   
                  * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
                   
                  * ``IAMCertificateId``   
                   
                  * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
                   

                  
            
              

              - **Restrictions** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.

                
                

                - **GeoRestriction** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases.

                  
                  

                  - **RestrictionType** *(string) --* 

                    The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

                     

                     
                    * ``none`` : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location. 
                     
                    * ``blacklist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                     
                    * ``whitelist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                     

                    
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    When geo restriction is ``enabled`` , this is the number of countries in your ``whitelist`` or ``blacklist`` . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , and you can omit ``Items`` .

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist`` ) or not distribute your content (``blacklist`` ).

                     

                    The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist`` . Include one ``Location`` element for each country.

                     

                    CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
            
              

              - **WebACLId** *(string) --* 

                The Web ACL Id (if any) associated with the distribution.

                
              

              - **HttpVersion** *(string) --* 

                Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is ``http2`` . Viewers that don't support ``HTTP/2`` will automatically use an earlier version.

                
              

              - **IsIPV6Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution.

                
              

              - **AliasICPRecordals** *(list) --* 

                Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions.

                 

                For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions. The status is returned in the CloudFront response; you can't configure it yourself.

                   

                  For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

                  
                  

                  - **CNAME** *(string) --* 

                    A domain name associated with a distribution. 

                    
                  

                  - **ICPRecordalStatus** *(string) --* 

                    The Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal status for a CNAME. The ICPRecordalStatus is set to APPROVED for all CNAMEs (aliases) in regions outside of China. 

                     

                    The status values returned are the following:

                     

                     
                    * **APPROVED** indicates that the associated CNAME has a valid ICP recordal number. Multiple CNAMEs can be associated with a distribution, and CNAMEs can correspond to different ICP recordals. To be marked as APPROVED, that is, valid to use with China region, a CNAME must have one ICP recordal number associated with it. 
                     
                    * **SUSPENDED** indicates that the associated CNAME does not have a valid ICP recordal number. 
                     
                    * **PENDING** indicates that CloudFront can't determine the ICP recordal status of the CNAME associated with the distribution because there was an error in trying to determine the status. You can try again to see if the error is resolved in which case CloudFront returns an APPROVED or SUSPENDED status.

  .. py:method:: list_distributions_by_realtime_log_config(**kwargs)

    

    Gets a list of distributions that have a cache behavior that’s associated with the specified real-time log configuration.

     

    You can specify the real-time log configuration by its name or its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must provide at least one. If you provide both, CloudFront uses the name to identify the real-time log configuration to list distributions for.

     

    You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the ``NextMarker`` value from the current response as the ``Marker`` value in the subsequent request.

                          - **HeaderName** *(string) --* 

                            The name of a header that you want CloudFront to send to your origin. For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/forward-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                            
                          

                          - **HeaderValue** *(string) --* 

                            The value for the header that you specified in the ``HeaderName`` field.

                            
                      
                    
                  
                    

                    - **S3OriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                      Use this type to specify an origin that is an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. To specify any other type of origin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting, use the ``CustomOriginConfig`` type instead.

                      
                      

                      - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

                        The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the origin. Use an origin access identity to configure the origin so that viewers can *only* access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                         

                        origin-access-identity/cloudfront/*ID-of-origin-access-identity*  

                         

                        where `` *ID-of-origin-access-identity* `` is the value that CloudFront returned in the ``ID`` element when you created the origin access identity.

                         

                        If you want viewers to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                         

                        To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                         

                        To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                         

                        For more information about the origin access identity, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                        
                  
                    

                    - **CustomOriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                      Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the Amazon S3 bucket is configured with static website hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured with static website hosting, use the ``S3OriginConfig`` type instead.

                      
                      

                      - **HTTPPort** *(integer) --*

                        Specify the Region that has the lowest latency to your origin. To specify a region, use the region code, not the region name. For example, specify the US East (Ohio) region as ``us-east-2`` .

                         

                        When you enable CloudFront Origin Shield, you must specify the Region for Origin Shield. For the list of Regions that you can specify, and for help choosing the best Region for your origin, see `Choosing the Region for Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html#choose-origin-shield-region>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a second origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify. You create an origin group to support origin failover in CloudFront. When you create or update a distribution, you can specifiy the origin group instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover from the primary origin to the second origin under the failover conditions that you've chosen.

                - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                  .. warning::

                     

                    We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                     

                   

                  A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                   

                  When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                    
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --*

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A list of account identifiers.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
                

                - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                  A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                   

                  When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                    
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of key groups in the list.

                - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                  The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                   

                   
                  * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                   
                  * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. 
                   
                  * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). 
                   

                   

                  For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                  
                

                - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                   

                   
                  * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                   

                   

                  If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
                  

                  - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                     

                     
                    * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                     

                     

                    If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
              
                

                - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                  Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                  
                

                - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                  Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                

                - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --*

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                     **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                    
                    

                    - *(dict) --* 

                      A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                      
                      

                      - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                        The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                        
                      

                      - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                        Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                         

                         
                        * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                         
                        * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                         
                        * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                         
                        * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                         

                        
                      

                      - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                        A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content.

                    Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                     

                    If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                     

                    If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                     

                    If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                    You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

                     

                    For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    If you don’t want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don’t include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

                     

                    To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

                     

                    To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

                     

                    For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **PathPattern** *(string) --* 

                      The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        You can optionally include a slash (``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` .

                         

                       

                      The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.

                       

                      For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                    

                    - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                      The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.

                      
                    

                    - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                      .. warning::

                         

                        We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                         

                       

                      A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                       

                      When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                      

                      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                        This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                        
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of accounts in the list.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A list of account identifiers.

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                  
                    

                    - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                      A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                       

                      When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                      

                      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                        This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                        
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of key groups in the list.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A list of key groups identifiers.

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                  
                    

                    - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                      The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                       

                       
                      * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                       
                      * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  
                       
                      * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).  
                       

                       

                      For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                         

                      
                    

                    - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                      A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                       

                       
                      * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                       
                      * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                       
                      * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                       

                       

                      If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                      
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                      

                      - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                        A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                         

                         
                        * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                         
                        * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                         

                         

                        If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                        
                        

                        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                          The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                          
                        

                        - **Items** *(list) --* 

                          A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                          
                          

                          - *(string) --* 
                      
                    
                  
                    

                    - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                      Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                      
                    

                    - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                      Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true; if not, specify false. For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                    

                    - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                      A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

                      
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of Lambda@Edge function associations for this cache behavior.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                         **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                        
                        

                        - *(dict) --* 

                          A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                          
                          

                          - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                            The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                            
                          

                          - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                            Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                             

                             
                            * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                             
                            * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                             
                            * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                             
                            * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                             

                            
                          

                          - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                            A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content. For more information, see `Accessing the Request Body by Choosing the Include Body Option <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-include-body-access.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

                      A list of CloudFront functions that are associated with this cache behavior. CloudFront functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.

                      
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of CloudFront functions in the list.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        The CloudFront functions that are associated with a cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution. CloudFront functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.

                        
                        

                        - *(dict) --* 

                          A CloudFront function that is associated with a cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution.

                          
                          

                          - **FunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function.

                        Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                         

                        If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                         

                        If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                         

                        If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                          If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                  The number of HTTP status codes for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A complex type that contains a ``CustomErrorResponse`` element for each HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. 

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls:

                     

                     
                    * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.  
                     
                    * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
                     

                     

                    For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **ErrorCode** *(integer) --* 

                      The HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                      
                    

                    - **ResponsePagePath** *(string) --* 

                      The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

                       

                       
                      * The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` .  
                       
                      * The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. 
                       

                       

                      If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` .

                       

                      We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

                      
                    

                    - **ResponseCode** *(string) --* 

                      The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

                       

                       
                      * Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. 
                       
                      * If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. 
                       
                      * You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. 
                       

                       

                      If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .

                      
                    

                    - **ErrorCachingMinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                      The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode`` . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

                       

                      For more information, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                
              
            
              

              - **Comment** *(string) --* 

                The comment originally specified when this distribution was created.

                
              

              - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

                A complex type that contains information about price class for this streaming distribution. 

                
              

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether the distribution is enabled to accept user requests for content.

                
              

              - **ViewerCertificate** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that determines the distribution’s SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

                
                

                - **CloudFrontDefaultCertificate** *(boolean) --* 

                  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` .

                   

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields:

                   

                   
                  * ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
                   
                  * ``MinimumProtocolVersion``   
                   
                  * ``SSLSupportMethod``   
                   

                  
                

                - **IAMCertificateId** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate.

                   

                  If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . 

                  
                

                - **ACMCertificateArn** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`__ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1`` ).

                   

                  If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` .

                  
                

                - **SSLSupportMethod** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.

                   

                   
                  * ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. 
                   
                  * ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don’t support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. 
                   
                  * ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ . 
                   

                   

                  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don’t set a value for this field.

                  
                

                - **MinimumProtocolVersion** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

                   

                   
                  * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. 
                   
                  * The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 
                   

                   

                  For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`__ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    On the CloudFront console, this setting is called **Security Policy** .

                     

                   

                  When you’re using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher.

                   

                  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

                  
                

                - **Certificate** *(string) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

                   

                   
                  * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
                   
                  * ``IAMCertificateId``   
                   
                  * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
                   

                  
                

                - **CertificateSource** *(string) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

                   

                   
                  * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
                   
                  * ``IAMCertificateId``   
                   
                  * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
                   

                  
            
              

              - **Restrictions** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.

                
                

                - **GeoRestriction** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases.

                  
                  

                  - **RestrictionType** *(string) --* 

                    The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

                     

                     
                    * ``none`` : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location. 
                     
                    * ``blacklist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                     
                    * ``whitelist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                     

                    
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    When geo restriction is ``enabled`` , this is the number of countries in your ``whitelist`` or ``blacklist`` . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , and you can omit ``Items`` .

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist`` ) or not distribute your content (``blacklist`` ).

                     

                    The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist`` . Include one ``Location`` element for each country.

                     

                    CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
            
              

              - **WebACLId** *(string) --* 

                The Web ACL Id (if any) associated with the distribution.

                
              

              - **HttpVersion** *(string) --* 

                Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is ``http2`` . Viewers that don't support ``HTTP/2`` will automatically use an earlier version.

                
              

              - **IsIPV6Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution.

                
              

              - **AliasICPRecordals** *(list) --* 

                Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions.

                 

                For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions. The status is returned in the CloudFront response; you can't configure it yourself.

                   

                  For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

                  
                  

                  - **CNAME** *(string) --* 

                    A domain name associated with a distribution. 

                    
                  

                  - **ICPRecordalStatus** *(string) --* 

                    The Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal status for a CNAME. The ICPRecordalStatus is set to APPROVED for all CNAMEs (aliases) in regions outside of China. 

                     

                    The status values returned are the following:

                     

                     
                    * **APPROVED** indicates that the associated CNAME has a valid ICP recordal number. Multiple CNAMEs can be associated with a distribution, and CNAMEs can correspond to different ICP recordals. To be marked as APPROVED, that is, valid to use with China region, a CNAME must have one ICP recordal number associated with it. 
                     
                    * **SUSPENDED** indicates that the associated CNAME does not have a valid ICP recordal number. 
                     
                    * **PENDING** indicates that CloudFront can't determine the ICP recordal status of the CNAME associated with the distribution because there was an error in trying to determine the status. You can try again to see if the error is resolved in which case CloudFront returns an APPROVED or SUSPENDED status.

      Use ``Marker`` and ``MaxItems`` to control pagination of results. If you have more than ``MaxItems`` distributions that satisfy the request, the response includes a ``NextMarker`` element. To get the next page of results, submit another request. For the value of ``Marker`` , specify the value of ``NextMarker`` from the last response. (For the first request, omit ``Marker`` .) 

      

    
    :type MaxItems: string
    :param MaxItems: 

      The maximum number of distributions that you want CloudFront to return in the response body. The maximum and default values are both 100.

      

    
    :type WebACLId: string
    :param WebACLId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ID of the WAF web ACL that you want to list the associated distributions. If you specify "null" for the ID, the request returns a list of the distributions that aren't associated with a web ACL.

                    An origin is the location where content is stored, and from which CloudFront gets content to serve to viewers. To specify an origin:

                     

                     
                    * Use ``S3OriginConfig`` to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. 
                     
                    * Use ``CustomOriginConfig`` to specify all other kinds of origins, including: 

                       
                      * An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting 
                       
                      * An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer 
                       
                      * An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint 
                       
                      * An AWS Elemental MediaStore container 
                       
                      * Any other HTTP server, running on an Amazon EC2 instance or any other kind of host 
                       

                     
                     

                     

                    For the current maximum number of origins that you can specify per distribution, see `General Quotas on Web Distributions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-web-distributions>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* (quotas were formerly referred to as limits).

                    
                    

                    - **Id** *(string) --* 

                      A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be unique within the distribution.

                       

                      Use this value to specify the ``TargetOriginId`` in a ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` .

                      
                    

                    - **DomainName** *(string) --* 

                      The domain name for the origin.

                       

                      For more information, see `Origin Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesDomainName>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                    

                    - **OriginPath** *(string) --* 

                      An optional path that CloudFront appends to the origin domain name when CloudFront requests content from the origin.

                       

                      For more information, see `Origin Path <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginPath>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                    

                    - **CustomHeaders** *(dict) --* 

                      A list of HTTP header names and values that CloudFront adds to the requests that it sends to the origin.

                        The number of custom headers, if any, for this distribution.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                         **Optional** : A list that contains one ``OriginCustomHeader`` element for each custom header that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin. If Quantity is ``0`` , omit ``Items`` .

                        
                        

                        - *(dict) --* 

                          A complex type that contains ``HeaderName`` and ``HeaderValue`` elements, if any, for this distribution. 

                          
                          

                          - **HeaderName** *(string) --* 

                            The name of a header that you want CloudFront to send to your origin. For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/forward-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                            The value for the header that you specified in the ``HeaderName`` field.

                            
                      
                    
                  
                    

                    - **S3OriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                      Use this type to specify an origin that is an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. To specify any other type of origin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting, use the ``CustomOriginConfig`` type instead.

                      
                      

                      - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

                        The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the origin. Use an origin access identity to configure the origin so that viewers can *only* access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                         

                        origin-access-identity/cloudfront/*ID-of-origin-access-identity*  

                         

                        where `` *ID-of-origin-access-identity* `` is the value that CloudFront returned in the ``ID`` element when you created the origin access identity.

                         

                        If you want viewers to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                         

                        To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                         

                        To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                         

                        For more information about the origin access identity, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                        
                  
                    

                    - **CustomOriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                      Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the Amazon S3 bucket is configured with static website hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured with static website hosting, use the ``S3OriginConfig`` type instead.

                      
                      

                      - **HTTPPort** *(integer) --* 

                        The HTTP port that CloudFront uses to connect to the origin. Specify the HTTP port that the origin listens on.

                        
                      

                      - **HTTPSPort** *(integer) --*

                        Specifies the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that CloudFront uses to connect to the origin. Valid values are:

                         

                         
                        * ``http-only`` – CloudFront always uses HTTP to connect to the origin. 
                         
                        * ``match-viewer`` – CloudFront connects to the origin using the same protocol that the viewer used to connect to CloudFront. 
                         
                        * ``https-only`` – CloudFront always uses HTTPS to connect to the origin. 
                         

                        
                      

                      - **OriginSslProtocols** *(dict) --* 

                        Specifies the minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront uses when connecting to your origin over HTTPS. Valid values include ``SSLv3`` , ``TLSv1`` , ``TLSv1.1`` , and ``TLSv1.2`` .

                         

                        For more information, see `Minimum Origin SSL Protocol <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginSSLProtocols>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    - **OriginShield** *(dict) --* 

                      CloudFront Origin Shield. Using Origin Shield can help reduce the load on your origin.

                       

                      For more information, see `Using Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                      

                      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                        A flag that specifies whether Origin Shield is enabled.

                         

                        When it’s enabled, CloudFront routes all requests through Origin Shield, which can help protect your origin. When it’s disabled, CloudFront might send requests directly to your origin from multiple edge locations or regional edge caches.

                        Specify the Region that has the lowest latency to your origin. To specify a region, use the region code, not the region name. For example, specify the US East (Ohio) region as ``us-east-2`` .

                         

                        When you enable CloudFront Origin Shield, you must specify the Region for Origin Shield. For the list of Regions that you can specify, and for help choosing the best Region for your origin, see `Choosing the Region for Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html#choose-origin-shield-region>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a second origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify. You create an origin group to support origin failover in CloudFront. When you create or update a distribution, you can specifiy the origin group instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover from the primary origin to the second origin under the failover conditions that you've chosen.

                    
                    

                    - **Id** *(string) --*

                        The status codes that, when returned from the primary origin, will trigger CloudFront to failover to the second origin.

                        
                        

                        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                          The number of status codes.

                          
                        

                        - **Items** *(list) --* 

                          The items (status codes) for an origin group.

                A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if files don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.

                
                

                - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                  The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.

                  A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                   

                  When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                  A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                   

                  When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                    
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of key groups in the list.

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A list of key groups identifiers.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
                

                - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                  The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                   

                   
                  * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                   
                  * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. 
                   
                  * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). 
                   

                   

                  For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                  
                

                - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                   

                   
                  * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                   

                   

                  If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
                  

                  - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                     

                     
                    * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                     

                     

                    If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
              
                

                - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                  Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                  
                

                - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                  Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                

                - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --*

                      - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                        The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                        
                      

                      - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                        Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                         

                         
                        * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                         
                        * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                         
                        * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                         
                        * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                         

                        
                      

                      - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                        A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content. For more information, see `Accessing the Request Body by Choosing the Include Body Option <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-include-body-access.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

                      - **FunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function.

                        
                      

                      - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                        The event type of the function, either ``viewer-request`` or ``viewer-response`` . You cannot use origin-facing event types (``origin-request`` and ``origin-response`` ) with a CloudFront function.

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Working with policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  A ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` .

                   

                  A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                  
                  

                  - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                     

                    If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy.

                    Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                     

                    If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                     

                    If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                     

                    If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                     

                    For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **Cookies** *(dict) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                     

                    If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    If you want to send cookies to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy.

                    - **Forward** *(string) --* 

                      This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                       

                      If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      If you want to send cookies to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the ``WhitelistedNames`` complex type.

                       

                      Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the ``Forward`` element.

                      Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                       

                      If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                    A complex type that specifies the ``Headers`` , if any, that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior (whitelisted headers). For the headers that you specify, CloudFront also caches separate versions of a specified object that is based on the header values in viewer requests.

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of ``whitelisted`` query string parameters for a cache behavior.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A list that contains the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use as a basis for caching for a cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is 0, you can omit ``Items`` .

                - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

                  
                

                - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --*

                  The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects.

              - **CacheBehaviors** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of cache behaviors for this distribution. 

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  Optional: A complex type that contains cache behaviors for this distribution. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.

                     

                    You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

                     

                    For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    If you don’t want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don’t include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

                     

                    To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

                     

                    To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

                     

                    For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **PathPattern** *(string) --* 

                      The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        You can optionally include a slash (``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` .

                         

                       

                      The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.

                       

                      For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                    

                    - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                      The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.

                      
                    

                    - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                      .. warning::

                         

                        We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                         

                       

                      A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                       

                      When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                      

                      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                        This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                        
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of accounts in the list.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A list of account identifiers.

                    - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                      A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                       

                      When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                      

                      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                        This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                        
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of key groups in the list.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A list of key groups identifiers.

                    - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                      The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                       

                       
                      * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                       
                      * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  
                       
                      * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).  
                       

                       

                      For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                         

                      
                    

                    - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                      A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                       

                       
                      * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                       
                      * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                       
                      * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                       

                       

                      If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                      
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                      

                      - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                        A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                         

                         
                        * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                         
                        * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                         

                         

                        If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                        
                        

                        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                          The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                          
                        

                        - **Items** *(list) --* 

                          A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                          
                          

                          - *(string) --* 
                      
                    
                  
                    

                    - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                      Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                      
                    

                    - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                      Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true; if not, specify false. For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                    

                    - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                      A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

                      
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of Lambda@Edge function associations for this cache behavior.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                         **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                        
                        

                        - *(dict) --* 

                          A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                          
                          

                          - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                            The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                            * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                             
                            * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                             
                            * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                             
                            * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                             

                            
                          

                          - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                            A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content. For more information, see `Accessing the Request Body by Choosing the Include Body Option <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-include-body-access.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

                      This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Working with policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      A ``CacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` .

                       

                      A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                      
                      

                      - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                        This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                         

                        If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                         

                        If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                         

                        Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                         

                        If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                         

                        If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                         

                        If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                         

                        For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                        
                      

                      - **Cookies** *(dict) --* 

                        This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                         

                        If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy.

                          This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                           

                          If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                           

                          If you want to send cookies to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                           

                          Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the ``WhitelistedNames`` complex type.

                           

                          Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the ``Forward`` element.

                          Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                           

                          If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                  A complex type that contains a ``CustomErrorResponse`` element for each HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. 

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls:

                     

                     
                    * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.  
                     
                    * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
                     

                     

                    For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **ErrorCode** *(integer) --* 

                      The HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                      
                    

                    - **ResponsePagePath** *(string) --* 

                      The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

                       

                       
                      * The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` .  
                       
                      * The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. 
                       

                       

                      If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` .

                       

                      We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

                      
                    

                    - **ResponseCode** *(string) --* 

                      The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

                       

                       
                      * Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. 
                       
                      * If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. 
                       
                      * You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. 
                       

                       

                      If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .

                      
                    

                    - **ErrorCachingMinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                      The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode`` . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

                       

                      For more information, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                A complex type that contains information about price class for this streaming distribution. 

                
              

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether the distribution is enabled to accept user requests for content.

                
              

              - **ViewerCertificate** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that determines the distribution’s SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

                
                

                - **CloudFrontDefaultCertificate** *(boolean) --* 

                  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` .

                   

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields:

                   

                   
                  * ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
                   
                  * ``MinimumProtocolVersion``   
                   
                  * ``SSLSupportMethod``   
                   

                  
                

                - **IAMCertificateId** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate.

                   

                  If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . 

                  
                

                - **ACMCertificateArn** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`__ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1`` ).

                   

                  If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` .

                  
                

                - **SSLSupportMethod** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.

                   

                   
                  * ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. 
                   
                  * ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don’t support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. 
                   
                  * ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ . 
                   

                   

                  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don’t set a value for this field.

                  
                

                - **MinimumProtocolVersion** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

                   

                   
                  * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. 
                   
                  * The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 
                   

                   

                  For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`__ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    On the CloudFront console, this setting is called **Security Policy** .

                     

                   

                  When you’re using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher.

                   

                  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

                  
                

                - **Certificate** *(string) --*

              - **Restrictions** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.

                
                

                - **GeoRestriction** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases.

                  
                  

                  - **RestrictionType** *(string) --* 

                    The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

                     

                     
                    * ``none`` : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location. 
                     
                    * ``blacklist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                     
                    * ``whitelist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                     

                    
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    When geo restriction is ``enabled`` , this is the number of countries in your ``whitelist`` or ``blacklist`` . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , and you can omit ``Items`` .

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist`` ) or not distribute your content (``blacklist`` ).

                     

                    The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist`` . Include one ``Location`` element for each country.

                     

                    CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.

              - **WebACLId** *(string) --* 

                The Web ACL Id (if any) associated with the distribution.

                
              

              - **HttpVersion** *(string) --* 

                Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is ``http2`` . Viewers that don't support ``HTTP/2`` will automatically use an earlier version.

                
              

              - **IsIPV6Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution.

                
              

              - **AliasICPRecordals** *(list) --* 

                Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions.

                 

                For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions. The status is returned in the CloudFront response; you can't configure it yourself.

                   

                  For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

                  
                  

                  - **CNAME** *(string) --*

                  - **ICPRecordalStatus** *(string) --* 

                    The Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal status for a CNAME. The ICPRecordalStatus is set to APPROVED for all CNAMEs (aliases) in regions outside of China. 

                     

                    The status values returned are the following:

                     

                     
                    * **APPROVED** indicates that the associated CNAME has a valid ICP recordal number. Multiple CNAMEs can be associated with a distribution, and CNAMEs can correspond to different ICP recordals. To be marked as APPROVED, that is, valid to use with China region, a CNAME must have one ICP recordal number associated with it. 
                     
                    * **SUSPENDED** indicates that the associated CNAME does not have a valid ICP recordal number. 
                     
                    * **PENDING** indicates that CloudFront can't determine the ICP recordal status of the CNAME associated with the distribution because there was an error in trying to determine the status. You can try again to see if the error is resolved in which case CloudFront returns an APPROVED or SUSPENDED status.

  .. py:method:: test_function(**kwargs)

    

    Tests a CloudFront function.

     

    To test a function, you provide an *event object* that represents an HTTP request or response that your CloudFront distribution could receive in production. CloudFront runs the function, passing it the event object that you provided, and returns the function’s result (the modified event object) in the response. The response also contains function logs and error messages, if any exist. For more information about testing functions, see `Testing functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/managing-functions.html#test-function>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

     

    To test a function, you provide the function’s name and version (``ETag`` value) along with the event object. To get the function’s name and version, you can use ``ListFunctions`` and ``DescribeFunction`` .

    :type CachePolicyConfig: dict
    :param CachePolicyConfig: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A cache policy configuration.

      

    
      - **Comment** *(string) --* 

        A comment to describe the cache policy. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

        

      
      - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A unique name to identify the cache policy.

        

      
      - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

        The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value as the object’s time to live (TTL) only when the origin does *not* send ``Cache-Control`` or ``Expires`` headers with the object. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

         

        The default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one day). If the value of ``MinTTL`` is more than 86400 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of ``MinTTL`` .

        

      
      - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value only when the origin sends ``Cache-Control`` or ``Expires`` headers with the object. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

         

        The default value for this field is 31536000 seconds (one year). If the value of ``MinTTL`` or ``DefaultTTL`` is more than 31536000 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of ``DefaultTTL`` .

        

      
      - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        

      
      - **ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin** *(dict) --* 

        The HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings to include in the cache key. The values included in the cache key are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

        

      
        - **EnableAcceptEncodingGzip** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

           

          This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true``  *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

           

           
          * Normalizes the value of the viewer’s ``Accept-Encoding`` header 
           
          * Includes the normalized header in the cache key 
           
          * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary 
           

           

          For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

           

          If you set this value to ``true`` , and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true`` , so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

           

          If both of these fields are ``false`` , then CloudFront treats the ``Accept-Encoding`` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request. By default, it’s not included in the cache key and it’s not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.

          

        
        - **EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

           

          This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingGzip`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true``  *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

           

           
          * Normalizes the value of the viewer’s ``Accept-Encoding`` header 
           
          * Includes the normalized header in the cache key 
           
          * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary 
           

           

          For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

           

          If you set this value to ``true`` , and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true`` , so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

        - **HeadersConfig** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An object that determines whether any HTTP headers (and if so, which headers) are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

          

        
          - **HeaderBehavior** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Determines whether any HTTP headers are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:

             

             
            * ``none`` – HTTP headers are not included in the cache key and are not automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field is set to ``none`` , any headers that are listed in an ``OriginRequestPolicy``  *are* included in origin requests. 
             
            * ``whitelist`` – The HTTP headers that are listed in the ``Headers`` type are included in the cache key and are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. 
             

            

          
          - **Headers** *(dict) --* 

            Contains a list of HTTP header names.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **CachePolicy** *(dict) --* 

          A cache policy.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the cache policy.

            
          

          - **LastModifiedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time when the cache policy was last modified.

            
          

          - **CachePolicyConfig** *(dict) --* 

            The cache policy configuration.

            
            

            - **Comment** *(string) --* 

              A comment to describe the cache policy. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

              
            

            - **Name** *(string) --* 

              A unique name to identify the cache policy.

              
            

            - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

              The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value as the object’s time to live (TTL) only when the origin does *not* send ``Cache-Control`` or ``Expires`` headers with the object. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              The default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one day). If the value of ``MinTTL`` is more than 86400 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of ``MinTTL`` .

              
            

            - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

              The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value only when the origin sends ``Cache-Control`` or ``Expires`` headers with the object. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              The default value for this field is 31536000 seconds (one year). If the value of ``MinTTL`` or ``DefaultTTL`` is more than 31536000 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of ``DefaultTTL`` .

              
            

            - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* 

              The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
            

            - **ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin** *(dict) --* 

              The HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings to include in the cache key. The values included in the cache key are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

              
              

              - **EnableAcceptEncodingGzip** *(boolean) --* 

                A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 

                This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true``  *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

                 

                 
                * Normalizes the value of the viewer’s ``Accept-Encoding`` header 
                 
                * Includes the normalized header in the cache key 
                 
                * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary 
                 

                 

                For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you set this value to ``true`` , and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true`` , so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

                 

                If both of these fields are ``false`` , then CloudFront treats the ``Accept-Encoding`` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request. By default, it’s not included in the cache key and it’s not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.

                
              

              - **EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli** *(boolean) --* 

                A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 

                This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingGzip`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true``  *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

                 

                 
                * Normalizes the value of the viewer’s ``Accept-Encoding`` header 
                 
                * Includes the normalized header in the cache key 
                 
                * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary 
                 

                 

                For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you set this value to ``true`` , and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true`` , so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

                  * ``whitelist`` – The cookies in viewer requests that are listed in the ``CookieNames`` type are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                - **QueryStringBehavior** *(string) --* 

                  Determines whether any URL query strings in viewer requests are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:

                   

                   
                  * ``none`` – Query strings in viewer requests are not included in the cache key and are not automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field is set to ``none`` , any query strings that are listed in an ``OriginRequestPolicy``  *are* included in origin requests. 
                   
                  * ``whitelist`` – The query strings in viewer requests that are listed in the ``QueryStringNames`` type are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. 
                   
                  * ``allExcept`` – All query strings in viewer requests that are * **not** * listed in the ``QueryStringNames`` type are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. 
                   
                  * ``all`` – All query strings in viewer requests are included in the cache key and are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. 
                   

                  
                

                - **QueryStrings** *(dict) --* 

                  Contains the specific query strings in viewer requests that either * **are** * or * **are not** * included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. The behavior depends on whether the ``QueryStringBehavior`` field in the ``CachePolicyQueryStringsConfig`` type is set to ``whitelist`` (the listed query strings * **are** * included) or ``allExcept`` (the listed query strings * **are not** * included, but all other query strings are).

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of query string names in the ``Items`` list.

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A list of query string names.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
            
          
        
      
        

        - **ETag** *(string) --* 

          The current version of the cache policy.

      )
    :type CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig: dict
    :param CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The identity's configuration information.

      

    
      - **CallerReference** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

         

        If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig`` object), a new origin access identity is created.

         

        If the ``CallerReference`` is a value already sent in a previous identity request, and the content of the ``CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig`` is identical to the original request (ignoring white space), the response includes the same information returned to the original request. 

         

        If the ``CallerReference`` is a value you already sent in a previous request to create an identity, but the content of the ``CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig`` is different from the original request, CloudFront returns a ``CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityAlreadyExists`` error. 

        

      
      - **Comment** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A comment to describe the origin access identity. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

        

      
    
    :type Id: string
    :param Id: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The identity's id.

  .. py:method:: update_distribution(**kwargs)

    

    Updates the configuration for a web distribution. 

     

    .. warning::

       

      When you update a distribution, there are more required fields than when you create a distribution. When you update your distribution by using this API action, follow the steps here to get the current configuration and then make your updates, to make sure that you include all of the required fields. To view a summary, see `Required Fields for Create Distribution and Update Distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-overview-required-fields.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

       

     

    The update process includes getting the current distribution configuration, updating the XML document that is returned to make your changes, and then submitting an ``UpdateDistribution`` request to make the updates.

     

    For information about updating a distribution using the CloudFront console instead, see `Creating a Distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-creating-console.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

     

     **To update a web distribution using the CloudFront API**  

     

     
    * Submit a `GetDistributionConfig <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_GetDistributionConfig.html>`__ request to get the current configuration and an ``Etag`` header for the distribution. 

    .. note::

       If you update the distribution again, you must get a new ``Etag`` header. 

     
     
    * Update the XML document that was returned in the response to your ``GetDistributionConfig`` request to include your changes.  

    .. warning::

       When you edit the XML file, be aware of the following: 

         
        * You must strip out the ETag parameter that is returned. 
         
        * Additional fields are required when you update a distribution. There may be fields included in the XML file for features that you haven't configured for your distribution. This is expected and required to successfully update the distribution. 
         
        * You can't change the value of ``CallerReference`` . If you try to change this value, CloudFront returns an ``IllegalUpdate`` error.  
         
        * The new configuration replaces the existing configuration; the values that you specify in an ``UpdateDistribution`` request are not merged into your existing configuration. When you add, delete, or replace values in an element that allows multiple values (for example, ``CNAME`` ), you must specify all of the values that you want to appear in the updated distribution. In addition, you must update the corresponding ``Quantity`` element. 
         

       

     
     
    * Submit an ``UpdateDistribution`` request to update the configuration for your distribution: 

       
      * In the request body, include the XML document that you updated in Step 2. The request body must include an XML document with a ``DistributionConfig`` element. 
       
      * Set the value of the HTTP ``If-Match`` header to the value of the ``ETag`` header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the ``GetDistributionConfig`` request in Step 1. 
       

     
     
    * Review the response to the ``UpdateDistribution`` request to confirm that the configuration was successfully updated. 
     
    * Optional: Submit a `GetDistribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_GetDistribution.html>`__ request to confirm that your changes have propagated. When propagation is complete, the value of ``Status`` is ``Deployed`` .

    :type DistributionConfig: dict
    :param DistributionConfig: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The distribution's configuration information.

      

    
      - **CallerReference** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

         

        If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``DistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

         

        If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

        

      
      - **Aliases** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain names), if any, for this distribution.

        

      
        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

          

        
        - **Items** *(list) --* 

          A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
      - **DefaultRootObject** *(string) --* 

        The object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin (for example, ``index.html`` ) when a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution (``http://www.example.com`` ) instead of an object in your distribution (``http://www.example.com/product-description.html`` ). Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.

         

        Specify only the object name, for example, ``index.html`` . Don't add a ``/`` before the object name.

         

        If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a distribution, include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

         

        To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

         

        To replace the default root object, update the distribution configuration and specify the new object.

         

        For more information about the default root object, see `Creating a Default Root Object <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DefaultRootObject.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        

      
      - **Origins** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A complex type that contains information about origins for this distribution. 

        

      
        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The number of origins for this distribution.

          

        
        - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A list of origins.

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            An origin.

             

            An origin is the location where content is stored, and from which CloudFront gets content to serve to viewers. To specify an origin:

             

             
            * Use ``S3OriginConfig`` to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. 
             
            * Use ``CustomOriginConfig`` to specify all other kinds of origins, including: 

               
              * An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting 
               
              * An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer 
               
              * An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint 
               
              * An AWS Elemental MediaStore container 
               
              * Any other HTTP server, running on an Amazon EC2 instance or any other kind of host 
               

             
             

             

            For the current maximum number of origins that you can specify per distribution, see `General Quotas on Web Distributions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-web-distributions>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* (quotas were formerly referred to as limits).

            

          
            - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be unique within the distribution.

               

              Use this value to specify the ``TargetOriginId`` in a ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` .

              

            
            - **DomainName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The domain name for the origin.

               

              For more information, see `Origin Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesDomainName>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
            - **OriginPath** *(string) --* 

              An optional path that CloudFront appends to the origin domain name when CloudFront requests content from the origin.

               

              For more information, see `Origin Path <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginPath>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
            - **CustomHeaders** *(dict) --* 

              A list of HTTP header names and values that CloudFront adds to the requests that it sends to the origin.

               

              For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/add-origin-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                 **Optional** : A list that contains one ``OriginCustomHeader`` element for each custom header that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin. If Quantity is ``0`` , omit ``Items`` .

                

              
                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that contains ``HeaderName`` and ``HeaderValue`` elements, if any, for this distribution. 

                  

                
                  - **HeaderName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The name of a header that you want CloudFront to send to your origin. For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/forward-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            - **S3OriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

              Use this type to specify an origin that is an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. To specify any other type of origin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting, use the ``CustomOriginConfig`` type instead.

              

            
              - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the origin. Use an origin access identity to configure the origin so that viewers can *only* access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                 

                origin-access-identity/cloudfront/*ID-of-origin-access-identity*  

                 

                where `` *ID-of-origin-access-identity* `` is the value that CloudFront returned in the ``ID`` element when you created the origin access identity.

                 

                If you want viewers to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                 

                To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                 

                To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                 

                For more information about the origin access identity, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                

              
            
            - **CustomOriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

              Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the Amazon S3 bucket is configured with static website hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured with static website hosting, use the ``S3OriginConfig`` type instead.

              

            
              - **HTTPPort** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              - **OriginKeepaliveTimeout** *(integer) --* 

                Specifies how long, in seconds, CloudFront persists its connection to the origin. The minimum timeout is 1 second, the maximum is 60 seconds, and the default (if you don’t specify otherwise) is 5 seconds.

                 

                For more information, see `Origin Keep-alive Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginKeepaliveTimeout>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                

              
            
            - **ConnectionAttempts** *(integer) --* 

              The number of times that CloudFront attempts to connect to the origin. The minimum number is 1, the maximum is 3, and the default (if you don’t specify otherwise) is 3.

               

              For a custom origin (including an Amazon S3 bucket that’s configured with static website hosting), this value also specifies the number of times that CloudFront attempts to get a response from the origin, in the case of an `Origin Response Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginResponseTimeout>`__ .

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                A flag that specifies whether Origin Shield is enabled.

                 

                When it’s enabled, CloudFront routes all requests through Origin Shield, which can help protect your origin. When it’s disabled, CloudFront might send requests directly to your origin from multiple edge locations or regional edge caches.

                

              
              - **OriginShieldRegion** *(string) --* 

                The Region for Origin Shield.

                 

                Specify the Region that has the lowest latency to your origin. To specify a region, use the region code, not the region name. For example, specify the US East (Ohio) region as ``us-east-2`` .

                 

                When you enable CloudFront Origin Shield, you must specify the Region for Origin Shield. For the list of Regions that you can specify, and for help choosing the best Region for your origin, see `Choosing the Region for Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html#choose-origin-shield-region>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          - *(dict) --* 

            An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a second origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify. You create an origin group to support origin failover in CloudFront. When you create or update a distribution, you can specifiy the origin group instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover from the primary origin to the second origin under the failover conditions that you've chosen.

            

          
            - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The origin group's ID.

                Items (origins) in an origin group.

                

              
                - *(dict) --* 

                  An origin in an origin group.

      - **DefaultCacheBehavior** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if files don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.

        

      
        - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.

          

        
        - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

          .. warning::

             

            We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

             

           

          A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

           

          When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          

        
          - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

            

          
          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The number of accounts in the list.

            

          
          - **Items** *(list) --* 

            A list of account identifiers.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
        - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

          A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

           

          When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          

        
          - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

            

          
          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The number of key groups in the list.

            

          
          - **Items** *(list) --* 

            A list of key groups identifiers.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
        - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

           

           
          * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
           
          * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. 
           
          * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). 
           

           

          For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

           

          .. note::

             

            The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

          

        
        - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

           

           
          * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
           
          * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
           
          * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
           

           

          If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

          

        
          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

            

          
          - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

             

             
            * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
             
            * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
             

             

            If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

            

          
            - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

              

            
            - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

        - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

          

        
        - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

          Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` .

                * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                 
                * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                 
                * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                 
                * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                 

                

              
              - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --*

          A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

          

        
          - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

             

            If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

             

            If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

             

            If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

             

            If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

             

            For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

               

              If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          

        
      
      - **CacheBehaviors** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements. 

        

      
        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The number of cache behaviors for this distribution. 

          

        
        - **Items** *(list) --* 

          Optional: A complex type that contains cache behaviors for this distribution. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.

             

            You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

             

            For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

             

            If you don’t want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don’t include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

             

            To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

             

            To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

             

            For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            

          
            - **PathPattern** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

               

              .. note::

                 

                You can optionally include a slash (``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` .

                 

               

              The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.

               

              For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
            - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.

              

            
            - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

              .. warning::

                 

                We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                 

               

              A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

               

              When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                

              
              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The number of accounts in the list.

                

              
              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A list of account identifiers.

                

              
                - *(string) --* 

                
            
            
            - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

              A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

               

              When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                

              
              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The number of key groups in the list.

                

              
              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A list of key groups identifiers.

                

              
                - *(string) --* 

                
            
            
            - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

               

               
              * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
               
              * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  
               
              * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).  
               

               

              For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              .. note::

                 

                The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

              

            
            - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

               

               
              * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
               
              * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
               
              * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
               

               

              If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

              

            
              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                

              
              - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                

              
                - *(string) --* 

                
            
              - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                 

                 
                * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                 

                 

                If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                

              
                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                  

                
                - **Items** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                  

                
                  - *(string) --* 

                  
              
              
            
            - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

              Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

              

            
            - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

              Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true; if not, specify false. For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              

            
            - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

              

            
              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The number of Lambda@Edge function associations for this cache behavior.

                

              
              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                 **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                

              
                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                  

                
                  - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                    

                  
                  - **EventType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                     

                     
                    * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                     
                    * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                     
                    * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                     
                    * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                     

                    

                  
                  - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --* 

                    A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have read access to the body content. For more information, see `Accessing the Request Body by Choosing the Include Body Option <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-include-body-access.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

                    

                  
                
            
            
            - **FunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

              A list of CloudFront functions that are associated with this cache behavior. CloudFront functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.

              

            
              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                The CloudFront functions that are associated with a cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution. CloudFront functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.

                

              
                - *(dict) --* 

                  A CloudFront function that is associated with a cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution.

                  

                
                  - **FunctionARN** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function.

                    

                  
                  - **EventType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The event type of the function, either ``viewer-request`` or ``viewer-response`` . You cannot use origin-facing event types (``origin-request`` and ``origin-response`` ) with a CloudFront function.

                    

                  
                
            
            
            - **FieldLevelEncryptionId** *(string) --* 

              The value of ``ID`` for the field-level encryption configuration that you want CloudFront to use for encrypting specific fields of data for this cache behavior.

              

            
            - **RealtimeLogConfigArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the real-time log configuration that is attached to this cache behavior.

              - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                 

                If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy.

                Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                 

                If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                 

                If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                 

                If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                  Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                   

                  If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

              

            
            - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

              This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field.

        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The number of HTTP status codes for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

          

        
        - **Items** *(list) --* 

          A complex type that contains a ``CustomErrorResponse`` element for each HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. 

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that controls:

             

             
            * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.  
             
            * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
             

             

            For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            

          
            - **ErrorCode** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

              

            
            - **ResponsePagePath** *(string) --* 

              The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

               

               
              * The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` .  
               
              * The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. 
               

               

              If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` .

               

              We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

              

            
            - **ResponseCode** *(string) --* 

              The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

               

               
              * Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. 
               
              * If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. 
               
              * You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. 
               

               

              If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .

              

            
            - **ErrorCachingMinTTL** *(integer) --* 

              The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode`` . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

        A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the distribution.

         

        For more information about logging, see `Access Logs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        

      
        - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify empty ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` , ``prefix`` , and ``IncludeCookies`` , the values are automatically deleted.

          

        
        - **IncludeCookies** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Specifies whether you want CloudFront to include cookies in access logs, specify ``true`` for ``IncludeCookies`` . If you choose to include cookies in logs, CloudFront logs all cookies regardless of how you configure the cache behaviors for this distribution. If you don't want to include cookies when you create a distribution or if you want to disable include cookies for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``IncludeCookies`` .

          

        
        - **Bucket** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

          

        
        - **Prefix** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log ``filenames`` for this distribution, for example, ``myprefix/`` . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an empty ``Prefix`` element in the ``Logging`` element.

          

        
      
      - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

        The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations.

         

        If you specify a price class other than ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower performance.

         

        For more information about price classes, see `Choosing the Price Class for a CloudFront Distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . For information about CloudFront pricing, including how price classes (such as Price Class 100) map to CloudFront regions, see `Amazon CloudFront Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/>`__ .

        

      
      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        From this field, you can enable or disable the selected distribution.

        

      
      - **ViewerCertificate** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that determines the distribution’s SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

        

      
        - **CloudFrontDefaultCertificate** *(boolean) --* 

          If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` .

           

          If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields:

           

           
          * ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
           
          * ``MinimumProtocolVersion``   
           
          * ``SSLSupportMethod``   
           

          

        
        - **IAMCertificateId** *(string) --* 

          If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate.

           

          If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . 

          

        
        - **ACMCertificateArn** *(string) --* 

          If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`__ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1`` ).

           

          If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` .

          

        
        - **SSLSupportMethod** *(string) --* 

          If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.

           

           
          * ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. 
           
          * ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don’t support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. 
           
          * ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ . 
           

           

          If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don’t set a value for this field.

          

        
        - **MinimumProtocolVersion** *(string) --* 

          If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

           

           
          * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. 
           
          * The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 
           

           

          For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`__ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

           

          .. note::

             

            On the CloudFront console, this setting is called **Security Policy** .

             

           

          When you’re using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher.

           

          If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

          

        
        - **Certificate** *(string) --* 

          This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

           

           
          * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
           
          * ``IAMCertificateId``   
           
          * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
           

          

        
        - **CertificateSource** *(string) --* 

          This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

           

           
          * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
           
          * ``IAMCertificateId``   
           
          * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
           

          

        
      
      - **Restrictions** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.

        

      
        - **GeoRestriction** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases.

          

        
          - **RestrictionType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

             

             
            * ``none`` : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location. 
             
            * ``blacklist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
             
            * ``whitelist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
             

            

          
          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            When geo restriction is ``enabled`` , this is the number of countries in your ``whitelist`` or ``blacklist`` . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , and you can omit ``Items`` .

            

          
          - **Items** *(list) --* 

            A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist`` ) or not distribute your content (``blacklist`` ).

             

            The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist`` . Include one ``Location`` element for each country.

             

            CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
      
      - **WebACLId** *(string) --* 

        A unique identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` . To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` .

         

        WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about WAF, see the `WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html>`__ . 

        

      
      - **HttpVersion** *(string) --* 

        (Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is http2. Viewers that don't support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

         

        For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLS 1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Identification (SNI).

         

        In general, configuring CloudFront to communicate with viewers using HTTP/2 reduces latency. You can improve performance by optimizing for HTTP/2. For more information, do an Internet search for "http/2 optimization." 

        

      
      - **IsIPV6Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

        If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify ``true`` . If you specify ``false`` , CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. 

         

        In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see `Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

         

        If you're using an Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true:

         

         
        * You enable IPv6 for the distribution 
         
        * You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects 
         

         

        For more information, see `Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration Developer Guide* .

         

        If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.

        

      
    
    :type Id: string
    :param Id: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The distribution's id.

      

    
    :type IfMatch: string
    :param IfMatch: 

      The value of the ``ETag`` header that you received when retrieving the distribution's configuration. For example: ``E2QWRUHAPOMQZL`` .

          - **DistributionConfig** *(dict) --* 

            The current configuration information for the distribution. Send a ``GET`` request to the ``/*CloudFront API version* /distribution ID/config`` resource.

            
            

            - **CallerReference** *(string) --* 

              A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

               

              If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``DistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

               

              If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
          
            

            - **DefaultRootObject** *(string) --* 

              The object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin (for example, ``index.html`` ) when a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution (``http://www.example.com`` ) instead of an object in your distribution (``http://www.example.com/product-description.html`` ). Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.

               

              Specify only the object name, for example, ``index.html`` . Don't add a ``/`` before the object name.

               

              If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a distribution, include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

               

              To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.

               

              To replace the default root object, update the distribution configuration and specify the new object.

               

              For more information about the default root object, see `Creating a Default Root Object <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DefaultRootObject.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  An origin is the location where content is stored, and from which CloudFront gets content to serve to viewers. To specify an origin:

                   

                   
                  * Use ``S3OriginConfig`` to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. 
                   
                  * Use ``CustomOriginConfig`` to specify all other kinds of origins, including: 

                     
                    * An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting 
                     
                    * An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer 
                     
                    * An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint

                    * Any other HTTP server, running on an Amazon EC2 instance or any other kind of host 
                     

                   
                   

                   

                  For the current maximum number of origins that you can specify per distribution, see `General Quotas on Web Distributions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-web-distributions>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* (quotas were formerly referred to as limits).

                  
                  

                  - **Id** *(string) --* 

                    A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be unique within the distribution.

                     

                    Use this value to specify the ``TargetOriginId`` in a ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` .

                    
                  

                  - **DomainName** *(string) --* 

                    The domain name for the origin.

                     

                    For more information, see `Origin Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesDomainName>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **OriginPath** *(string) --* 

                    An optional path that CloudFront appends to the origin domain name when CloudFront requests content from the origin.

                     

                    For more information, see `Origin Path <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginPath>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    A list of HTTP header names and values that CloudFront adds to the requests that it sends to the origin.

                     

                    For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/add-origin-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of custom headers, if any, for this distribution.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                       **Optional** : A list that contains one ``OriginCustomHeader`` element for each custom header that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin. If Quantity is ``0`` , omit ``Items`` .

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A complex type that contains ``HeaderName`` and ``HeaderValue`` elements, if any, for this distribution. 

                        
                        

                        - **HeaderName** *(string) --* 

                          The name of a header that you want CloudFront to send to your origin. For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/forward-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                          
                        

                        - **HeaderValue** *(string) --* 

                          The value for the header that you specified in the ``HeaderName`` field.

                          
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **S3OriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                    Use this type to specify an origin that is an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. To specify any other type of origin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting, use the ``CustomOriginConfig`` type instead.

                    
                    

                    - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

                      The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the origin. Use an origin access identity to configure the origin so that viewers can *only* access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                       

                      origin-access-identity/cloudfront/*ID-of-origin-access-identity*  

                       

                      where `` *ID-of-origin-access-identity* `` is the value that CloudFront returned in the ``ID`` element when you created the origin access identity.

                       

                      If you want viewers to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                       

                      To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                       

                      To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                       

                      For more information about the origin access identity, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                
                  

                  - **CustomOriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                    Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the Amazon S3 bucket is configured with static website hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured with static website hosting, use the ``S3OriginConfig`` type instead.

                  - **OriginShield** *(dict) --* 

                    CloudFront Origin Shield. Using Origin Shield can help reduce the load on your origin.

                     

                    For more information, see `Using Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                      A flag that specifies whether Origin Shield is enabled.

                       

                      When it’s enabled, CloudFront routes all requests through Origin Shield, which can help protect your origin. When it’s disabled, CloudFront might send requests directly to your origin from multiple edge locations or regional edge caches.

                      
                    

                    - **OriginShieldRegion** *(string) --* 

                      The Region for Origin Shield.

                       

                      Specify the Region that has the lowest latency to your origin. To specify a region, use the region code, not the region name. For example, specify the US East (Ohio) region as ``us-east-2`` .

                       

                      When you enable CloudFront Origin Shield, you must specify the Region for Origin Shield. For the list of Regions that you can specify, and for help choosing the best Region for your origin, see `Choosing the Region for Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html#choose-origin-shield-region>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a second origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify. You create an origin group to support origin failover in CloudFront. When you create or update a distribution, you can specifiy the origin group instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover from the primary origin to the second origin under the failover conditions that you've chosen.

                  
                  

                  - **Id** *(string) --*

            - **DefaultCacheBehavior** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if files don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.

              
              

              - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.

                
              

              - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                .. warning::

                   

                  We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                   

                 

                A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                 

                When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
                

                - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                  This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                  
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --*

                A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                 

                When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                 

                 
                * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                 
                * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. 
                 
                * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). 
                 

                 

                For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                
              

              - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                 

                 
                * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                 
                * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                 

                 

                If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --*

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                   

                   
                  * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                   

                   

                  If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
            
              

              - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                
              

              - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` .

                      Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                       

                       
                      * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                       
                      * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                       
                      * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                       
                      * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute.

                    - **FunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function.

                      
                    

                    - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                      The event type of the function, either ``viewer-request`` or ``viewer-response`` . You cannot use origin-facing event types (``origin-request`` and ``origin-response`` ) with a CloudFront function.

              - **ForwardedValues** *(dict) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Working with policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                   

                  If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy.

                  Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                   

                  If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                   

                  If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                   

                  If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                   

                  For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                

                - **Cookies** *(dict) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                  - **Forward** *(string) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                     

                    If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the ``WhitelistedNames`` complex type.

                     

                    Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the ``Forward`` element.

                    
                  

                  - **WhitelistedNames** *(dict) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                     

                    If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy.

A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                     

                    If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                     

                    For the current limit on the number of cookie names that you can whitelist for each cache behavior, see `CloudFront Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/xrefaws_service_limits.html#limits_cloudfront>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --*

                  If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  A complex type that contains information about the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use for caching for this cache behavior.

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of ``whitelisted`` query string parameters for a cache behavior.

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A list that contains the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use as a basis for caching for a cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is 0, you can omit ``Items`` . 

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
            
              

              - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

                
              

              - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
              

              - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

                This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                
          
            

            - **CacheBehaviors** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements. 

              
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                The number of cache behaviors for this distribution. 

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                Optional: A complex type that contains cache behaviors for this distribution. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.

                   

                  You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

                   

                  For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  If you don’t want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don’t include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

                   

                  To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

                   

                  To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

                   

                  For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **PathPattern** *(string) --* 

                    The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      You can optionally include a slash (``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` .

                       

                     

                    The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.

                     

                    For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                    The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.

                    
                  

                  - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                    .. warning::

                       

                      We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                       

                     

                    A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                     

                    When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                      This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                      
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of accounts in the list.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A list of account identifiers.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
                  

                  - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                    A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                     

                    When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                      This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                      
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of key groups in the list.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A list of key groups identifiers.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
                  

                  - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                    The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                     

                     
                    * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                     
                    * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  
                     
                    * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).  
                     

                     

                    For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                    
                  

                  - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                     

                     
                    * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                     

                     

                    If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                    

                    - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                      A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                       

                       
                      * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                       
                      * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                       

                       

                      If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly. 

                      
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of HTTP methods for which you want CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are ``2`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests) and ``3`` (for caching responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests).

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **SmoothStreaming** *(boolean) --* 

                    Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                    
                  

                  - **Compress** *(boolean) --* 

                    Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true; if not, specify false. For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **LambdaFunctionAssociations** *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of Lambda@Edge function associations for this cache behavior.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                       **Optional** : A complex type that contains ``LambdaFunctionAssociation`` items for this cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge function association.

                        
                        

                        - **LambdaFunctionARN** *(string) --* 

                          The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You must specify the ARN of a function version; you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                          
                        

                        - **EventType** *(string) --* 

                          Specifies the event type that triggers a Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can specify the following values:

                           

                           
                          * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                           
                          * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                           
                          * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                           
                          * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute.

                    If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                      This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                       

                      If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                       

                      If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                       

                      If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                       

                      If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                       

                      For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                        Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the ``WhitelistedNames`` complex type.

                         

                        Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the ``Forward`` element.

                        
                      

                      - **WhitelistedNames** *(dict) --* 

                        This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                        Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                         

                        If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                         

                        For the current limit on the number of cookie names that you can whitelist for each cache behavior, see `CloudFront Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/xrefaws_service_limits.html#limits_cloudfront>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

                    
                  

                  - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects.

            - **CustomErrorResponses** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that controls the following:

               

               
              * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer. 
               
              * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
               

               

              For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
              

              - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                The number of HTTP status codes for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                
              

              - **Items** *(list) --* 

                A complex type that contains a ``CustomErrorResponse`` element for each HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. 

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls:

                   

                   
                  * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.  
                   
                  * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
                   

                   

                  For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **ErrorCode** *(integer) --* 

                    The HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                    
                  

                  - **ResponsePagePath** *(string) --* 

                    The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

                     

                     
                    * The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` .  
                     
                    * The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. 
                     

                     

                    If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` .

                     

                    We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

                    
                  

                  - **ResponseCode** *(string) --* 

                    The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

                     

                     
                    * Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. 
                     
                    * If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. 
                     
                    * You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. 
                     

                     

                    If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .

                    
                  

                  - **ErrorCachingMinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                    The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode`` . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

                     

                    For more information, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
              
            
          
            

            - **Comment** *(string) --* 

              An optional comment to describe the distribution. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

              
            

            - **Logging** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the distribution.

               

              For more information about logging, see `Access Logs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              
              

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify empty ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` , ``prefix`` , and ``IncludeCookies`` , the values are automatically deleted.

                
              

              - **IncludeCookies** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether you want CloudFront to include cookies in access logs, specify ``true`` for ``IncludeCookies`` . If you choose to include cookies in logs, CloudFront logs all cookies regardless of how you configure the cache behaviors for this distribution. If you don't want to include cookies when you create a distribution or if you want to disable include cookies for an existing distribution, specify ``false`` for ``IncludeCookies`` .

                
              

              - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

                
              

              - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

                An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log ``filenames`` for this distribution, for example, ``myprefix/`` . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an empty ``Prefix`` element in the ``Logging`` element.

                
          
            

            - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

              The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations.

               

              If you specify a price class other than ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower performance.

               

              For more information about price classes, see `Choosing the Price Class for a CloudFront Distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . For information about CloudFront pricing, including how price classes (such as Price Class 100) map to CloudFront regions, see `Amazon CloudFront Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/>`__ .

              
            

            - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              From this field, you can enable or disable the selected distribution.

              
            

            - **ViewerCertificate** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that determines the distribution’s SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

              
              

              - **CloudFrontDefaultCertificate** *(boolean) --* 

                If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` .

                 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields:

                 

                 
                * ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
                 
                * ``MinimumProtocolVersion``   
                 
                * ``SSLSupportMethod``   
                 

                
              

              - **IAMCertificateId** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate.

                 

                If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . 

                
              

              - **ACMCertificateArn** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`__ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1`` ).

                 

                If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` .

                
              

              - **SSLSupportMethod** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.

                 

                 
                * ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. 
                 
                * ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don’t support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. 
                 
                * ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ . 
                 

                 

                If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don’t set a value for this field.

                
              

              - **MinimumProtocolVersion** *(string) --* 

                If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

                 

                 
                * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. 
                 
                * The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 
                 

                 

                For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`__ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  On the CloudFront console, this setting is called **Security Policy** .

                   

                 

                When you’re using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher.

                 

                If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

                
              

              - **Certificate** *(string) --* 

                This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

                 

                 
                * ``ACMCertificateArn``   
                 
                * ``IAMCertificateId``   
                 
                * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
                 

                
              

              - **CertificateSource** *(string) --* 

                This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields instead:

                * ``IAMCertificateId``   
                 
                * ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate``   
                 

                
          
            

            - **Restrictions** *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.

              
              

              - **GeoRestriction** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases.

                
                

                - **RestrictionType** *(string) --* 

                  The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

                   

                   
                  * ``none`` : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location. 
                   
                  * ``blacklist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                   
                  * ``whitelist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                   

                  
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  When geo restriction is ``enabled`` , this is the number of countries in your ``whitelist`` or ``blacklist`` . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , and you can omit ``Items`` .

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist`` ) or not distribute your content (``blacklist`` ).

                   

                  The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist`` . Include one ``Location`` element for each country.

                   

                  CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
            
          
            

            - **WebACLId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` . To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` .

               

              WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about WAF, see the `WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html>`__ . 

              
            

            - **HttpVersion** *(string) --* 

              (Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is http2. Viewers that don't support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

               

              For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLS 1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Identification (SNI).

               

              In general, configuring CloudFront to communicate with viewers using HTTP/2 reduces latency. You can improve performance by optimizing for HTTP/2. For more information, do an Internet search for "http/2 optimization." 

              
            

            - **IsIPV6Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify ``true`` . If you specify ``false`` , CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. 

               

              In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see `Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               

              If you're using an Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true:

               

               
              * You enable IPv6 for the distribution 
               
              * You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects 
               

               

              For more information, see `Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration Developer Guide* .

               

              If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.

              
        
          

          - **AliasICPRecordals** *(list) --* 

            Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions.

             

            For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions. The status is returned in the CloudFront response; you can't configure it yourself.

               

              For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

              
              

              - **CNAME** *(string) --* 

                A domain name associated with a distribution. 

                
              

              - **ICPRecordalStatus** *(string) --* 

                The Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal status for a CNAME. The ICPRecordalStatus is set to APPROVED for all CNAMEs (aliases) in regions outside of China. 

                 

                The status values returned are the following:

                 

                 
                * **APPROVED** indicates that the associated CNAME has a valid ICP recordal number. Multiple CNAMEs can be associated with a distribution, and CNAMEs can correspond to different ICP recordals. To be marked as APPROVED, that is, valid to use with China region, a CNAME must have one ICP recordal number associated with it. 
                 
                * **SUSPENDED** indicates that the associated CNAME does not have a valid ICP recordal number. 
                 
                * **PENDING** indicates that CloudFront can't determine the ICP recordal status of the CNAME associated with the distribution because there was an error in trying to determine the status. You can try again to see if the error is resolved in which case CloudFront returns an APPROVED or SUSPENDED status. 
                 

                
          
        
      
        

        - **ETag** *(string) --*

    :type StreamingDistributionConfig: dict
    :param StreamingDistributionConfig: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The streaming distribution's configuration information.

      

    
      - **CallerReference** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

         

        If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``StreamingDistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

         

        If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

        

      
      - **S3Origin** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A complex type that contains information about the Amazon S3 bucket from which you want CloudFront to get your media files for distribution. 

        

      
        - **DomainName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin. 

          

        
        - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the distribution. Use an origin access identity to configure the distribution so that end users can only access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

           

          If you want end users to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

           

          To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

           

          To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

           

          For more information, see `Using an Origin Access Identity to Restrict Access to Your Amazon S3 Content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          

        
      
      - **Aliases** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain names), if any, for this streaming distribution. 

        

      
        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

          

        
        - **Items** *(list) --* 

          A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to associate with this distribution.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
      - **Comment** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Any comments you want to include about the streaming distribution. 

        

      
      - **Logging** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the streaming distribution. 

        

      
        - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a streaming distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing streaming distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify ``empty Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` , the values are automatically deleted. 

          

        
        - **Bucket** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

          

        
        - **Prefix** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log filenames for this streaming distribution, for example, ``myprefix/`` . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an empty ``Prefix`` element in the ``Logging`` element.

          

        
      
      - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A complex type that specifies any accounts that you want to permit to create signed URLs for private content. If you want the distribution to use signed URLs, include this element; if you want the distribution to use public URLs, remove this element. For more information, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . 

        

      
        - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

          

        
        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The number of accounts in the list.

          

        
        - **Items** *(list) --*

          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
      - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

        A complex type that contains information about price class for this streaming distribution. 

        

      
      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Whether the streaming distribution is enabled to accept user requests for content.

        

      
    
    :type Id: string
    :param Id: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The streaming distribution's id.

      

    
    :type IfMatch: string
    :param IfMatch: 

      The value of the ``ETag`` header that you received when retrieving the streaming distribution's configuration. For example: ``E2QWRUHAPOMQZL`` .

              If the value of ``CallerReference`` is new (regardless of the content of the ``StreamingDistributionConfig`` object), CloudFront creates a new distribution.

               

              If ``CallerReference`` is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a ``DistributionAlreadyExists`` error.

                The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin. 

                
              

              - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

                The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the distribution. Use an origin access identity to configure the distribution so that end users can only access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

                 

                If you want end users to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                 

                To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                 

                To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                 

                For more information, see `Using an Origin Access Identity to Restrict Access to Your Amazon S3 Content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a streaming distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing streaming distribution, specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` , and specify ``empty Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` elements. If you specify ``false`` for ``Enabled`` but you specify values for ``Bucket`` and ``Prefix`` , the values are automatically deleted. 

                
              

              - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, ``myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`` .

        - **CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityList** *(dict) --* 

          The ``CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityList`` type. 

          
          

          - **Marker** *(string) --* 

            Use this when paginating results to indicate where to begin in your list of origin access identities. The results include identities in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next page of results, set the ``Marker`` to the value of the ``NextMarker`` from the current page's response (which is also the ID of the last identity on that page). 

            
          

          - **NextMarker** *(string) --* 

            If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value you can use for the ``Marker`` request parameter to continue listing your origin access identities where they left off. 

            
          

          - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

            The maximum number of origin access identities you want in the response body. 

            
          

          - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

            A flag that indicates whether more origin access identities remain to be listed. If your results were truncated, you can make a follow-up pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items in the list.

            
          

          - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

            The number of CloudFront origin access identities that were created by the current account.

                    An origin is the location where content is stored, and from which CloudFront gets content to serve to viewers. To specify an origin:

                     

                     
                    * Use ``S3OriginConfig`` to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. 
                     
                    * Use ``CustomOriginConfig`` to specify all other kinds of origins, including: 

                       
                      * An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting

                      * Any other HTTP server, running on an Amazon EC2 instance or any other kind of host 
                       

                     
                     

                     

                    For the current maximum number of origins that you can specify per distribution, see `General Quotas on Web Distributions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-web-distributions>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* (quotas were formerly referred to as limits).

                    
                    

                    - **Id** *(string) --* 

                      A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be unique within the distribution.

                       

                      Use this value to specify the ``TargetOriginId`` in a ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` .

                      
                    

                    - **DomainName** *(string) --* 

                      The domain name for the origin.

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                         **Optional** : A list that contains one ``OriginCustomHeader`` element for each custom header that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin. If Quantity is ``0`` , omit ``Items`` .

                        
                        

                        - *(dict) --* 

                          A complex type that contains ``HeaderName`` and ``HeaderValue`` elements, if any, for this distribution. 

                          
                          

                          - **HeaderName** *(string) --* 

                            The name of a header that you want CloudFront to send to your origin. For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/forward-custom-headers.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                            
                          

                          - **HeaderValue** *(string) --* 

                            The value for the header that you specified in the ``HeaderName`` field.

                            
                      
                    
                  
                    

                    - **S3OriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                      Use this type to specify an origin that is an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. To specify any other type of origin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting, use the ``CustomOriginConfig`` type instead.

                      
                      

                      - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

                        The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the origin. Use an origin access identity to configure the origin so that viewers can *only* access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                         

                        origin-access-identity/cloudfront/*ID-of-origin-access-identity*  

                         

                        where `` *ID-of-origin-access-identity* `` is the value that CloudFront returned in the ``ID`` element when you created the origin access identity.

                         

                        If you want viewers to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                         

                        To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                         

                        To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                         

                        For more information about the origin access identity, see `Serving Private Content through CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                        
                  
                    

                    - **CustomOriginConfig** *(dict) --* 

                      Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the Amazon S3 bucket is configured with static website hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured with static website hosting, use the ``S3OriginConfig`` type instead.

                      
                      

                      - **HTTPPort** *(integer) --*

                    - **OriginShield** *(dict) --* 

                      CloudFront Origin Shield. Using Origin Shield can help reduce the load on your origin.

                       

                      For more information, see `Using Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                      

                      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                        A flag that specifies whether Origin Shield is enabled.

                         

                        When it’s enabled, CloudFront routes all requests through Origin Shield, which can help protect your origin. When it’s disabled, CloudFront might send requests directly to your origin from multiple edge locations or regional edge caches.

                        Specify the Region that has the lowest latency to your origin. To specify a region, use the region code, not the region name. For example, specify the US East (Ohio) region as ``us-east-2`` .

                         

                        When you enable CloudFront Origin Shield, you must specify the Region for Origin Shield. For the list of Regions that you can specify, and for help choosing the best Region for your origin, see `Choosing the Region for Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html#choose-origin-shield-region>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a second origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify. You create an origin group to support origin failover in CloudFront. When you create or update a distribution, you can specifiy the origin group instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover from the primary origin to the second origin under the failover conditions that you've chosen.

                    
                    

                    - **Id** *(string) --*

                        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                          The number of status codes.

                          
                        

                        - **Items** *(list) --* 

                          The items (status codes) for an origin group.

                A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if files don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.

                
                

                - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                  The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.

                  
                

                - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                  .. warning::

                     

                    We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                     

                   

                  A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                   

                  When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                  The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                   

                   
                  * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                   
                  * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. 
                   
                  * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). 
                   

                   

                  For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                  
                

                - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                   

                   
                  * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                   
                  * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                   

                   

                  If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                  
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin.

                  - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                     

                     
                    * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                     
                    * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                     

                     

                    If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly.

                  Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` . 

                  
                

                - **Compress** *(boolean) --*

                        * ``viewer-request`` : The function executes when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer and before it checks to see whether the requested object is in the edge cache.  
                         
                        * ``origin-request`` : The function executes only when CloudFront sends a request to your origin. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                         
                        * ``origin-response`` : The function executes after CloudFront receives a response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response. When the requested object is in the edge cache, the function doesn't execute. 
                         
                        * ``viewer-response`` : The function executes before CloudFront returns the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object was already in the edge cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't execute. 
                         

                        
                      

                      - **IncludeBody** *(boolean) --*

                  If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                  
                  

                  - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                     

                    If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy.

                    Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                     

                    If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                     

                    If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                     

                    If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                     

                    For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                  

                  - **Cookies** *(dict) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                     

                    If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy.

                      Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the ``WhitelistedNames`` complex type.

                       

                      Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the ``Forward`` element.

                      
                    

                    - **WhitelistedNames** *(dict) --* 

                      This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                       

                      If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy.

                      Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                       

                      If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                       

                      For the current limit on the number of cookie names that you can whitelist for each cache behavior, see `CloudFront Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/xrefaws_service_limits.html#limits_cloudfront>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    A complex type that specifies the ``Headers`` , if any, that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior (whitelisted headers). For the headers that you specify, CloudFront also caches separate versions of a specified object that is based on the header values in viewer requests.

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of header names in the ``Items`` list.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A list of HTTP header names.

                  - **QueryStringCacheKeys** *(dict) --* 

                    This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                     

                    If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy.

                    A complex type that contains information about the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use for caching for this cache behavior.

                    
                    

                    - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of ``whitelisted`` query string parameters for a cache behavior.

                      
                    

                    - **Items** *(list) --* 

                      A list that contains the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use as a basis for caching for a cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is 0, you can omit ``Items`` . 

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
              
                

                - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

                  
                

                - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                  
                

                - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

                  This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects.

              - **CacheBehaviors** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of cache behaviors for this distribution. 

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  Optional: A complex type that contains cache behaviors for this distribution. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.

                     

                    You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

                     

                    For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                     

                    If you don’t want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don’t include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

                     

                    To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

                     

                    To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

                     

                    For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **PathPattern** *(string) --* 

                      The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        You can optionally include a slash (``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` .

                         

                       

                      The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.

                       

                      For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                    

                    - **TargetOriginId** *(string) --* 

                      The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.

                      
                    

                    - **TrustedSigners** *(dict) --* 

                      .. warning::

                         

                        We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` .

                         

                       

                      A list of account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                       

                      When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer’s account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                      

                      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                        This field is ``true`` if any of the accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                        
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of accounts in the list.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A list of account identifiers.

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                  
                    

                    - **TrustedKeyGroups** *(dict) --* 

                      A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                       

                      When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                      

                      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                        This field is ``true`` if any of the key groups in the list have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is ``false`` .

                        
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of key groups in the list.

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A list of key groups identifiers.

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                  
                    

                    - **ViewerProtocolPolicy** *(string) --* 

                      The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options:

                       

                       
                      * ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. 
                       
                      * ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  
                       
                      * ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).  
                       

                       

                      For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                         

                      
                    

                    - **AllowedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                      A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                       

                       
                      * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                       
                      * CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                       
                      * CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. 
                       

                       

                      If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                      
                      

                      - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                        The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests), 3 (for ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests) and 7 (for ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests).

                        
                      

                      - **Items** *(list) --* 

                        A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                        
                        

                        - *(string) --* 
                    
                      

                      - **CachedMethods** *(dict) --* 

                        A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                         

                         
                        * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. 
                         
                        * CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. 
                         

                         

                        If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly.

                      - **QueryString** *(boolean) --* 

                        This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                         

                        If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                        Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

                         

                        If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

                         

                        If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

                         

                        If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                         

                        For more information, see `Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                        
                      

                      - **Cookies** *(dict) --* 

                        This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field.

                          Required if you specify ``whitelist`` for the value of ``Forward`` . A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                           

                          If you specify ``all`` or ``none`` for the value of ``Forward`` , omit ``WhitelistedNames`` . If you change the value of ``Forward`` from ``whitelist`` to ``all`` or ``none`` and you don't delete the ``WhitelistedNames`` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                        A complex type that specifies the ``Headers`` , if any, that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior (whitelisted headers). For the headers that you specify, CloudFront also caches separate versions of a specified object that is based on the header values in viewer requests.

                        A complex type that contains information about the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use for caching for this cache behavior.

                        
                        

                        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                          The number of ``whitelisted`` query string parameters for a cache behavior.

                          
                        

                        - **Items** *(list) --* 

                          A list that contains the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use as a basis for caching for a cache behavior. If ``Quantity`` is 0, you can omit ``Items`` .

                      The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).

                      
                    

                    - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

                      This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                       

                      The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects.

                    - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

                      This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`__ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              - **CustomErrorResponses** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that contains zero or more ``CustomErrorResponses`` elements.

                
                

                - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of HTTP status codes for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. If ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , you can omit ``Items`` .

                  
                

                - **Items** *(list) --* 

                  A complex type that contains a ``CustomErrorResponse`` element for each HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. 

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A complex type that controls:

                     

                     
                    * Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.  
                     
                    * How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. 
                     

                     

                    For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                    
                    

                    - **ErrorCode** *(integer) --* 

                      The HTTP status code for which you want to specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                      
                    

                    - **ResponsePagePath** *(string) --* 

                      The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

                       

                       
                      * The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` .  
                       
                      * The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. 
                       

                       

                      If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` .

                       

                      We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

                      
                    

                    - **ResponseCode** *(string) --* 

                      The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

                       

                       
                      * Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. 
                       
                      * If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. 
                       
                      * You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. 
                       

                       

                      If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .

                      
                    

                    - **ErrorCachingMinTTL** *(integer) --* 

                      The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode`` . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

                       

                      For more information, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                      
                
              
            
              

              - **Comment** *(string) --* 

                The comment originally specified when this distribution was created.

                
              

              - **PriceClass** *(string) --* 

                A complex type that contains information about price class for this streaming distribution. 

                
              

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether the distribution is enabled to accept user requests for content.

                
              

              - **ViewerCertificate** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that determines the distribution’s SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

                
                

                - **CloudFrontDefaultCertificate** *(boolean) --* 

                  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` .

                   

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields:

                   

                   
                  * ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
                   
                  * ``MinimumProtocolVersion``   
                   
                  * ``SSLSupportMethod``   
                   

                  
                

                - **IAMCertificateId** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate.

                   

                  If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . 

                  
                

                - **ACMCertificateArn** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`__ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1`` ).

                   

                  If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` .

                  
                

                - **SSLSupportMethod** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.

                   

                   
                  * ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. 
                   
                  * ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don’t support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. 
                   
                  * ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ . 
                   

                   

                  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don’t set a value for this field.

                  
                

                - **MinimumProtocolVersion** *(string) --* 

                  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

                   

                   
                  * The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. 
                   
                  * The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 
                   

                   

                  For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`__ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    On the CloudFront console, this setting is called **Security Policy** .

                     

                   

                  When you’re using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher.

                   

                  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

                  
                

                - **Certificate** *(string) --*

              - **Restrictions** *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.

                
                

                - **GeoRestriction** *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases.

                  
                  

                  - **RestrictionType** *(string) --* 

                    The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

                     

                     
                    * ``none`` : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location. 
                     
                    * ``blacklist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                     
                    * ``whitelist`` : The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content. 
                     

                    
                  

                  - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

                    When geo restriction is ``enabled`` , this is the number of countries in your ``whitelist`` or ``blacklist`` . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, ``Quantity`` is ``0`` , and you can omit ``Items`` .

                    
                  

                  - **Items** *(list) --* 

                    A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist`` ) or not distribute your content (``blacklist`` ).

                     

                    The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist`` . Include one ``Location`` element for each country.

                     

                    CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.

              - **HttpVersion** *(string) --* 

                Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is ``http2`` . Viewers that don't support ``HTTP/2`` will automatically use an earlier version.

                
              

              - **IsIPV6Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Whether CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution.

                
              

              - **AliasICPRecordals** *(list) --* 

                Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions.

                 

                For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

                
                

                - *(dict) --*

AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions. The status is returned in the CloudFront response; you can't configure it yourself.

                   

                  For more information about ICP recordals, see `Signup, Accounts, and Credentials <https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html>`__ in *Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China* .

                  - **ICPRecordalStatus** *(string) --* 

                    The Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal status for a CNAME. The ICPRecordalStatus is set to APPROVED for all CNAMEs (aliases) in regions outside of China. 

                     

                    The status values returned are the following:

                     

                     
                    * **APPROVED** indicates that the associated CNAME has a valid ICP recordal number. Multiple CNAMEs can be associated with a distribution, and CNAMEs can correspond to different ICP recordals. To be marked as APPROVED, that is, valid to use with China region, a CNAME must have one ICP recordal number associated with it. 
                     
                    * **SUSPENDED** indicates that the associated CNAME does not have a valid ICP recordal number. 
                     
                    * **PENDING** indicates that CloudFront can't determine the ICP recordal status of the CNAME associated with the distribution because there was an error in trying to determine the status. You can try again to see if the error is resolved in which case CloudFront returns an APPROVED or SUSPENDED status.

                - **OriginAccessIdentity** *(string) --* 

                  The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the distribution. Use an origin access identity to configure the distribution so that end users can only access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

                   

                  If you want end users to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                   

                  To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.

                   

                  To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.

                   

                  For more information, see `Using an Origin Access Identity to Restrict Access to Your Amazon S3 Content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

Generate a signed URL for Amazon CloudFront
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following example shows how to generate a signed URL for Amazon CloudFront.
Note that you will need the ``cryptography`` `library <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/>`__ to follow this example::

    import datetime

    from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding
    from botocore.signers import CloudFrontSigner


    def rsa_signer(message):
        with open('path/to/key.pem', 'rb') as key_file:
            private_key = serialization.load_pem_private_key(
                key_file.read(),
                password=None,
                backend=default_backend()
            )
        return private_key.sign(message, padding.PKCS1v15(), hashes.SHA1())

    key_id = 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE'
    url = 'http://d2949o5mkkp72v.cloudfront.net/hello.txt'
    expire_date = datetime.datetime(2017, 1, 1)

    cloudfront_signer = CloudFrontSigner(key_id, rsa_signer)

    # Create a signed url that will be valid until the specific expiry date
    # provided using a canned policy.
    signed_url = cloudfront_signer.generate_presigned_url(
        url, date_less_than=expire_date)
    print(signed_url)
