  .. py:method:: associate_file_system_aliases(**kwargs)

    

    Use this action to associate one or more Domain Name Server (DNS) aliases with an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. A file systen can have a maximum of 50 DNS aliases associated with it at any one time. If you try to associate a DNS alias that is already associated with the file system, FSx takes no action on that alias in the request. For more information, see `Working with DNS Aliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-dns-aliases.html>`__ and `Walkthrough 5\: Using DNS aliases to access your file system <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/walkthrough05-file-system-custom-CNAME.html>`__ , including additional steps you must take to be able to access your file system using a DNS alias.

     

    The system response shows the DNS aliases that Amazon FSx is attempting to associate with the file system. Use the API operation to monitor the status of the aliases Amazon FSx is associating with the file system.

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: cancel_data_repository_task(**kwargs)

    

    Cancels an existing Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository task if that task is in either the ``PENDING`` or ``EXECUTING`` state. When you cancel a task, Amazon FSx does the following.

     

     
    * Any files that FSx has already exported are not reverted. 
     
    * FSx continues to export any files that are "in-flight" when the cancel operation is received. 
     
    * FSx does not export any files that have not yet been exported.

  .. py:method:: copy_backup(**kwargs)

    

    Copies an existing backup within the same AWS account to another Region (cross-Region copy) or within the same Region (in-Region copy). You can have up to five backup copy requests in progress to a single destination Region per account.

     

    You can use cross-Region backup copies for cross-region disaster recovery. You periodically take backups and copy them to another Region so that in the event of a disaster in the primary Region, you can restore from backup and recover availability quickly in the other Region. You can make cross-Region copies only within your AWS partition.

     

    You can also use backup copies to clone your file data set to another Region or within the same Region.

     

    You can use the ``SourceRegion`` parameter to specify the AWS Region from which the backup will be copied. For example, if you make the call from the ``us-west-1`` Region and want to copy a backup from the ``us-east-2`` Region, you specify ``us-east-2`` in the ``SourceRegion`` parameter to make a cross-Region copy. If you don't specify a Region, the backup copy is created in the same Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy).

     

    For more information on creating backup copies, see `Copying backups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-backups.html#copy-backups>`__ in the *Amazon FSx for Windows User Guide* and `Copying backups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-backups-fsx.html#copy-backups>`__ in the *Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide* .

      This field is autopopulated if not provided.

    
    :type SourceBackupId: string
    :param SourceBackupId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ID of the source backup. Specifies the ID of the backup that is being copied.

      

    
    :type SourceRegion: string
    :param SourceRegion: 

      The source AWS Region of the backup. Specifies the AWS Region from which the backup is being copied. The source and destination Regions must be in the same AWS partition. If you don't specify a Region, it defaults to the Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy).

      

    
    :type KmsKeyId: string
    :param KmsKeyId: 

      The ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key used to encrypt the file system's data for Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems and Amazon FSx for Lustre ``PERSISTENT_1`` file systems at rest. In either case, if not specified, the Amazon FSx managed key is used. The Amazon FSx for Lustre ``SCRATCH_1`` and ``SCRATCH_2`` file systems are always encrypted at rest using Amazon FSx managed keys. For more information, see `Encrypt <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service API Reference* .

      

    
    :type CopyTags: boolean
    :param CopyTags: 

      A boolean flag indicating whether tags from the source backup should be copied to the backup copy. This value defaults to false.

       

      If you set ``CopyTags`` to true and the source backup has existing tags, you can use the ``Tags`` parameter to create new tags, provided that the sum of the source backup tags and the new tags doesn't exceed 50. Both sets of tags are merged. If there are tag conflicts (for example, two tags with the same key but different values), the tags created with the ``Tags`` parameter take precedence.

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      A list of ``Tag`` values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A value that specifies the ``TagKey`` , the name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which they are attached.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A value that specifies the ``TagValue`` , the value assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of ``finances : April`` and also of ``payroll : April`` .

  .. py:method:: create_backup(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx file system. Creating regular backups for your file system is a best practice, enabling you to restore a file system from a backup if an issue arises with the original file system.

     

    For Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, you can create a backup only for file systems with the following configuration:

     

     
    * a Persistent deployment type 
     
    * is *not* linked to a data respository. 
     

     

    For more information about backing up Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, see `Working with FSx for Lustre backups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-backups-fsx.html>`__ .

     

    For more information about backing up Amazon FSx for Windows file systems, see `Working with FSx for Windows backups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-backups.html>`__ .

     

    If a backup with the specified client request token exists, and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the existing backup. If a backup specified client request token exists, and the parameters don't match, this operation returns ``IncompatibleParameterError`` . If a backup with the specified client request token doesn't exist, ``CreateBackup`` does the following: 

     

     
    * Creates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of ``CREATING`` . 
     
    * Returns the description of the backup. 
     

     

    By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a ``CreateBackup`` operation without the risk of creating an extra backup. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a backup was created. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a backup, the operation returns a successful result because all the parameters are the same.

     

    The ``CreateBackup`` operation returns while the backup's lifecycle state is still ``CREATING`` . You can check the backup creation status by calling the  DescribeBackups operation, which returns the backup state along with other information.

    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      (Optional) A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent creation. This string is automatically filled on your behalf when you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or an AWS SDK.

      This field is autopopulated if not provided.

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      (Optional) The tags to apply to the backup at backup creation. The key value of the ``Name`` tag appears in the console as the backup name. If you have set ``CopyTagsToBackups`` to true, and you specify one or more tags using the ``CreateBackup`` action, no existing file system tags are copied from the file system to the backup.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A value that specifies the ``TagKey`` , the name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which they are attached.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A value that specifies the ``TagValue`` , the value assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of ``finances : April`` and also of ``payroll : April`` .

              - **CopyTagsToBackups** *(boolean) --* 

                A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system should be copied to backups. If it's set to true, all tags on the file system are copied to all automatic backups and any user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify any tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the file system, regardless of this value. (Default = false)

  .. py:method:: create_data_repository_task(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository task. You use data repository tasks to perform bulk operations between your Amazon FSx file system and its linked data repository. An example of a data repository task is exporting any data and metadata changes, including POSIX metadata, to files, directories, and symbolic links (symlinks) from your FSx file system to its linked data repository. A ``CreateDataRepositoryTask`` operation will fail if a data repository is not linked to the FSx file system. To learn more about data repository tasks, see `Data Repository Tasks <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/data-repository-tasks.html>`__ . To learn more about linking a data repository to your file system, see `Linking your file system to an S3 bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/create-fs-linked-data-repo.html>`__ .

    :type Paths: list
    :param Paths: 

      (Optional) The path or paths on the Amazon FSx file system to use when the data repository task is processed. The default path is the file system root directory. The paths you provide need to be relative to the mount point of the file system. If the mount point is ``/mnt/fsx`` and ``/mnt/fsx/path1`` is a directory or file on the file system you want to export, then the path to provide is ``path1`` . If a path that you provide isn't valid, the task fails.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type FileSystemId: string
    :param FileSystemId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon FSx.

      

    
    :type Report: dict
    :param Report: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Defines whether or not Amazon FSx provides a CompletionReport once the task has completed. A CompletionReport provides a detailed report on the files that Amazon FSx processed that meet the criteria specified by the ``Scope`` parameter. For more information, see `Working with Task Completion Reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/task-completion-report.html>`__ .

      

    
      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Set ``Enabled`` to ``True`` to generate a ``CompletionReport`` when the task completes. If set to ``true`` , then you need to provide a report ``Scope`` , ``Path`` , and ``Format`` . Set ``Enabled`` to ``False`` if you do not want a ``CompletionReport`` generated when the task completes.

        

      
      - **Path** *(string) --* 

        Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true`` . Specifies the location of the report on the file system's linked S3 data repository. An absolute path that defines where the completion report will be stored in the destination location. The ``Path`` you provide must be located within the file system’s ExportPath. An example ``Path`` value is "s3://myBucket/myExportPath/optionalPrefix". The report provides the following information for each file in the report: FilePath, FileStatus, and ErrorCode. To learn more about a file system's ``ExportPath`` , see . 

        

      
      - **Format** *(string) --* 

        Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true`` . Specifies the format of the ``CompletionReport`` . ``REPORT_CSV_20191124`` is the only format currently supported. When ``Format`` is set to ``REPORT_CSV_20191124`` , the ``CompletionReport`` is provided in CSV format, and is delivered to ``{path}/task-{id}/failures.csv`` . 

        

      
      - **Scope** *(string) --* 

        Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true`` . Specifies the scope of the ``CompletionReport`` ; ``FAILED_FILES_ONLY`` is the only scope currently supported. When ``Scope`` is set to ``FAILED_FILES_ONLY`` , the ``CompletionReport`` only contains information about files that the data repository task failed to process.

        

      
    
    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in a string of up to 64 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on your behalf when you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or an AWS SDK.

      This field is autopopulated if not provided.

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      A list of ``Tag`` values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A value that specifies the ``TagKey`` , the name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which they are attached.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A value that specifies the ``TagValue`` , the value assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of ``finances : April`` and also of ``payroll : April`` .

            - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              Set ``Enabled`` to ``True`` to generate a ``CompletionReport`` when the task completes. If set to ``true`` , then you need to provide a report ``Scope`` , ``Path`` , and ``Format`` . Set ``Enabled`` to ``False`` if you do not want a ``CompletionReport`` generated when the task completes.

              
            

            - **Path** *(string) --* 

              Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true`` . Specifies the location of the report on the file system's linked S3 data repository. An absolute path that defines where the completion report will be stored in the destination location. The ``Path`` you provide must be located within the file system’s ExportPath. An example ``Path`` value is "s3://myBucket/myExportPath/optionalPrefix". The report provides the following information for each file in the report: FilePath, FileStatus, and ErrorCode. To learn more about a file system's ``ExportPath`` , see . 

              
            

            - **Format** *(string) --* 

              Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true`` . Specifies the format of the ``CompletionReport`` . ``REPORT_CSV_20191124`` is the only format currently supported. When ``Format`` is set to ``REPORT_CSV_20191124`` , the ``CompletionReport`` is provided in CSV format, and is delivered to ``{path}/task-{id}/failures.csv`` . 

              
            

            - **Scope** *(string) --* 

              Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true`` . Specifies the scope of the ``CompletionReport`` ; ``FAILED_FILES_ONLY`` is the only scope currently supported. When ``Scope`` is set to ``FAILED_FILES_ONLY`` , the ``CompletionReport`` only contains information about files that the data repository task failed to process.

  .. py:method:: create_file_system(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system.

     

    If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match, ``CreateFileSystem`` returns the description of the existing file system. If a file system specified client request token exists and the parameters don't match, this call returns ``IncompatibleParameterError`` . If a file system with the specified client request token doesn't exist, ``CreateFileSystem`` does the following: 

     

     
    * Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of ``CREATING`` . 
     
    * Returns the description of the file system. 
     

     

    This operation requires a client request token in the request that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent creation. This means that calling the operation multiple times with the same client request token has no effect. By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a ``CreateFileSystem`` operation without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client receives success as long as the parameters are the same.

     

    .. note::

       

      The ``CreateFileSystem`` call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still ``CREATING`` . You can check the file-system creation status by calling the  DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns the file system state along with other information.

      - **CopyTagsToBackups** *(boolean) --* 

        A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the file system should be copied to backups. This value defaults to false. If it's set to true, all tags for the file system are copied to all automatic and user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the file system, regardless of this value.

        

      
      - **Aliases** *(list) --* 

        An array of one or more DNS alias names that you want to associate with the Amazon FSx file system. Aliases allow you to use existing DNS names to access the data in your Amazon FSx file system. You can associate up to 50 aliases with a file system at any time. You can associate additional DNS aliases after you create the file system using the AssociateFileSystemAliases operation. You can remove DNS aliases from the file system after it is created using the DisassociateFileSystemAliases operation. You only need to specify the alias name in the request payload.

         

        For more information, see `Working with DNS Aliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-dns-aliases.html>`__ and `Walkthrough 5\: Using DNS aliases to access your file system <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/walkthrough05-file-system-custom-CNAME.html>`__ , including additional steps you must take to be able to access your file system using a DNS alias.

         

        An alias name has to meet the following requirements:

         

         
        * Formatted as a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), ``hostname.domain`` , for example, ``accounting.example.com`` . 
         
        * Can contain alphanumeric characters, the underscore (_), and the hyphen (-). 
         
        * Cannot start or end with a hyphen. 
         
        * Can start with a numeric. 
         

         

        For DNS alias names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters as lowercase letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify them: as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding letters in escape codes.

        - **FileAccessAuditLogLevel** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Sets which attempt type is logged by Amazon FSx for file and folder accesses.

           

           
          * ``SUCCESS_ONLY`` - only successful attempts to access files or folders are logged. 
           
          * ``FAILURE_ONLY`` - only failed attempts to access files or folders are logged. 
           
          * ``SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE`` - both successful attempts and failed attempts to access files or folders are logged. 
           
          * ``DISABLED`` - access auditing of files and folders is turned off. 
           

          

        
        - **FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Sets which attempt type is logged by Amazon FSx for file share accesses.

          The destination can be any Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group ARN or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream ARN, with the following requirements:

           

           
          * The destination ARN that you provide (either CloudWatch Logs log group or Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream) must be in the same AWS partition, AWS region, and AWS account as your Amazon FSx file system. 
           
          * The name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must begin with the ``/aws/fsx`` prefix. The name of the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehouse delivery stream must begin with the ``aws-fsx`` prefix. 
           
          * If you do not provide a destination in ``AuditLogDestination`` , Amazon FSx will create and use a log stream in the CloudWatch Logs ``/aws/fsx/windows`` log group. 
           
          * If ``AuditLogDestination`` is provided and the resource does not exist, the request will fail with a ``BadRequest`` error. 
           
          * If ``FileAccessAuditLogLevel`` and ``FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel`` are both set to ``DISABLED`` , you cannot specify a destination in ``AuditLogDestination`` . 
           

          

        
      
    
    :type LustreConfiguration: dict
    :param LustreConfiguration: 

      The Lustre configuration for the file system being created. 

      

    
      - **WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime** *(string) --* 

        (Optional) The preferred start time to perform weekly maintenance, formatted d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone, where d is the weekday number, from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.

        

      
      - **ImportPath** *(string) --* 

        (Optional) The path to the Amazon S3 bucket (including the optional prefix) that you're using as the data repository for your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. The root of your FSx for Lustre file system will be mapped to the root of the Amazon S3 bucket you select. An example is ``s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix`` . If you specify a prefix after the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are loaded into the file system.

        

      
      - **ExportPath** *(string) --* 

        (Optional) The path in Amazon S3 where the root of your Amazon FSx file system is exported. The path must use the same Amazon S3 bucket as specified in ImportPath. You can provide an optional prefix to which new and changed data is to be exported from your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. If an ``ExportPath`` value is not provided, Amazon FSx sets a default export path, ``s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre[creation-timestamp]`` . The timestamp is in UTC format, for example ``s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre20181105T222312Z`` .

         

        The Amazon S3 export bucket must be the same as the import bucket specified by ``ImportPath`` . If you only specify a bucket name, such as ``s3://import-bucket`` , you get a 1:1 mapping of file system objects to S3 bucket objects. This mapping means that the input data in S3 is overwritten on export. If you provide a custom prefix in the export path, such as ``s3://import-bucket/[custom-optional-prefix]`` , Amazon FSx exports the contents of your file system to that export prefix in the Amazon S3 bucket.

        

      
      - **ImportedFileChunkSize** *(integer) --* 

        (Optional) For files imported from a data repository, this value determines the stripe count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

         

        The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

        

      
      - **DeploymentType** *(string) --* 

        Choose ``SCRATCH_1`` and ``SCRATCH_2`` deployment types when you need temporary storage and shorter-term processing of data. The ``SCRATCH_2`` deployment type provides in-transit encryption of data and higher burst throughput capacity than ``SCRATCH_1`` .

         

        Choose ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment type for longer-term storage and workloads and encryption of data in transit. To learn more about deployment types, see `FSx for Lustre Deployment Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/lustre-deployment-types.html>`__ .

         

        Encryption of data in-transit is automatically enabled when you access a ``SCRATCH_2`` or ``PERSISTENT_1`` file system from Amazon EC2 instances that `support this feature <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/data- protection.html>`__ . (Default = ``SCRATCH_1`` ) 

         

        Encryption of data in-transit for ``SCRATCH_2`` and ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment types is supported when accessed from supported instance types in supported AWS Regions. To learn more, `Encrypting Data in Transit <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/encryption-in-transit-fsxl.html>`__ .

        

      
      - **AutoImportPolicy** *(string) --* 

        (Optional) When you create your file system, your existing S3 objects appear as file and directory listings. Use this property to choose how Amazon FSx keeps your file and directory listings up to date as you add or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket. ``AutoImportPolicy`` can have the following values:

         

         
        * ``NONE`` - (Default) AutoImport is off. Amazon FSx only updates file and directory listings from the linked S3 bucket when the file system is created. FSx does not update file and directory listings for any new or changed objects after choosing this option. 
         
        * ``NEW`` - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports directory listings of any new objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do not currently exist in the FSx file system.  
         
        * ``NEW_CHANGED`` - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports file and directory listings of any new objects added to the S3 bucket and any existing objects that are changed in the S3 bucket after you choose this option.  
         

         

        For more information, see `Automatically import updates from your S3 bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/autoimport-data-repo.html>`__ .

        

      
      - **PerUnitStorageThroughput** *(integer) --* 

        Required for the ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment type, describes the amount of read and write throughput for each 1 tebibyte of storage, in MB/s/TiB. File system throughput capacity is calculated by multiplying ﬁle system storage capacity (TiB) by the PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB). For a 2.4 TiB ﬁle system, provisioning 50 MB/s/TiB of PerUnitStorageThroughput yields 120 MB/s of ﬁle system throughput. You pay for the amount of throughput that you provision. 

         

        Valid values for SSD storage: 50, 100, 200. Valid values for HDD storage: 12, 40.

        

      
      - **DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime** *(string) --* 

        A recurring daily time, in the format ``HH:MM`` . ``HH`` is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and ``MM`` is the zero-padded minute of the hour. For example, ``05:00`` specifies 5 AM daily. 

        

      
      - **AutomaticBackupRetentionDays** *(integer) --* 

        The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this to 0 disables automatic backups. You can retain automatic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 0.

        

      
      - **CopyTagsToBackups** *(boolean) --* 

        (Optional) Not available to use with file systems that are linked to a data repository. A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the file system should be copied to backups. The default value is false. If it's set to true, all file system tags are copied to all automatic and user-initiated backups when the user doesn't specify any backup-specific tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more backup tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the file system, regardless of this value.

  .. py:method:: create_file_system_from_backup(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new Amazon FSx file system from an existing Amazon FSx backup.

     

    If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the file system. If a client request token specified by the file system exists and the parameters don't match, this call returns ``IncompatibleParameterError`` . If a file system with the specified client request token doesn't exist, this operation does the following:

     

     
    * Creates a new Amazon FSx file system from backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of ``CREATING`` . 
     
    * Returns the description of the file system. 
     

     

    Parameters like Active Directory, default share name, automatic backup, and backup settings default to the parameters of the file system that was backed up, unless overridden. You can explicitly supply other settings.

     

    By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a ``CreateFileSystemFromBackup`` call without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client receives success as long as the parameters are the same.

     

    .. note::

       

      The ``CreateFileSystemFromBackup`` call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still ``CREATING`` . You can check the file-system creation status by calling the  DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns the file system state along with other information.

        - **Password** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The password for the service account on your self-managed AD domain that Amazon FSx will use to join to your AD domain.

          

        
        - **DnsIps** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A list of up to two IP addresses of DNS servers or domain controllers in the self-managed AD directory. 

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
      - **DeploymentType** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the file system deployment type, valid values are the following:

         

         
        * ``MULTI_AZ_1`` - Deploys a high availability file system that is configured for Multi-AZ redundancy to tolerate temporary Availability Zone (AZ) unavailability. You can only deploy a Multi-AZ file system in AWS Regions that have a minimum of three Availability Zones. Also supports HDD storage type 
         
        * ``SINGLE_AZ_1`` - (Default) Choose to deploy a file system that is configured for single AZ redundancy. 
         
        * ``SINGLE_AZ_2`` - The latest generation Single AZ file system. Specifies a file system that is configured for single AZ redundancy and supports HDD storage type. 
         

         

        For more information, see `Availability and Durability\: Single-AZ and Multi-AZ File Systems <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/high-availability-multiAZ.html>`__ .

        

      
      - **PreferredSubnetId** *(string) --* 

        Required when ``DeploymentType`` is set to ``MULTI_AZ_1`` . This specifies the subnet in which you want the preferred file server to be located. For in-AWS applications, we recommend that you launch your clients in the same Availability Zone (AZ) as your preferred file server to reduce cross-AZ data transfer costs and minimize latency. 

        

      
      - **ThroughputCapacity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The throughput of an Amazon FSx file system, measured in megabytes per second, in 2 to the *n* th increments, between 2^3 (8) and 2^11 (2048).

        

      
      - **WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime** *(string) --* 

        The preferred start time to perform weekly maintenance, formatted d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone, where d is the weekday number, from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.

        

      
      - **DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime** *(string) --* 

        The preferred time to take daily automatic backups, formatted HH:MM in the UTC time zone.

        

      
      - **AutomaticBackupRetentionDays** *(integer) --* 

        The number of days to retain automatic backups. The default is to retain backups for 7 days. Setting this value to 0 disables the creation of automatic backups. The maximum retention period for backups is 90 days.

        

      
      - **CopyTagsToBackups** *(boolean) --* 

        A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the file system should be copied to backups. This value defaults to false. If it's set to true, all tags for the file system are copied to all automatic and user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the file system, regardless of this value.

        

      
      - **Aliases** *(list) --* 

        An array of one or more DNS alias names that you want to associate with the Amazon FSx file system. Aliases allow you to use existing DNS names to access the data in your Amazon FSx file system. You can associate up to 50 aliases with a file system at any time. You can associate additional DNS aliases after you create the file system using the AssociateFileSystemAliases operation. You can remove DNS aliases from the file system after it is created using the DisassociateFileSystemAliases operation. You only need to specify the alias name in the request payload.

         

        For more information, see `Working with DNS Aliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-dns-aliases.html>`__ and `Walkthrough 5\: Using DNS aliases to access your file system <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/walkthrough05-file-system-custom-CNAME.html>`__ , including additional steps you must take to be able to access your file system using a DNS alias.

         

        An alias name has to meet the following requirements:

         

         
        * Formatted as a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), ``hostname.domain`` , for example, ``accounting.example.com`` . 
         
        * Can contain alphanumeric characters, the underscore (_), and the hyphen (-). 
         
        * Cannot start or end with a hyphen. 
         
        * Can start with a numeric. 
         

         

        For DNS alias names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters as lowercase letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify them: as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding letters in escape codes.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **AuditLogConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        The configuration that Amazon FSx for Windows File Server uses to audit and log user accesses of files, folders, and file shares on the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system.

        

      
        - **FileAccessAuditLogLevel** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Sets which attempt type is logged by Amazon FSx for file and folder accesses.

           

           
          * ``SUCCESS_ONLY`` - only successful attempts to access files or folders are logged. 
           
          * ``FAILURE_ONLY`` - only failed attempts to access files or folders are logged. 
           
          * ``SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE`` - both successful attempts and failed attempts to access files or folders are logged. 
           
          * ``DISABLED`` - access auditing of files and folders is turned off. 
           

          

        
        - **FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Sets which attempt type is logged by Amazon FSx for file share accesses.

           

           
          * ``SUCCESS_ONLY`` - only successful attempts to access file shares are logged. 
           
          * ``FAILURE_ONLY`` - only failed attempts to access file shares are logged. 
           
          * ``SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE`` - both successful attempts and failed attempts to access file shares are logged. 
           
          * ``DISABLED`` - access auditing of file shares is turned off. 
           

          

        
        - **AuditLogDestination** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the destination of the audit logs.

           

          The destination can be any Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group ARN or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream ARN, with the following requirements:

           

           
          * The destination ARN that you provide (either CloudWatch Logs log group or Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream) must be in the same AWS partition, AWS region, and AWS account as your Amazon FSx file system. 
           
          * The name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must begin with the ``/aws/fsx`` prefix. The name of the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehouse delivery stream must begin with the ``aws-fsx`` prefix. 
           
          * If you do not provide a destination in ``AuditLogDestination`` , Amazon FSx will create and use a log stream in the CloudWatch Logs ``/aws/fsx/windows`` log group. 
           
          * If ``AuditLogDestination`` is provided and the resource does not exist, the request will fail with a ``BadRequest`` error. 
           
          * If ``FileAccessAuditLogLevel`` and ``FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel`` are both set to ``DISABLED`` , you cannot specify a destination in ``AuditLogDestination`` . 
           

          

        
      
    
    :type LustreConfiguration: dict
    :param LustreConfiguration: 

      The Lustre configuration for the file system being created. 

      

    
      - **WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime** *(string) --* 

        (Optional) The preferred start time to perform weekly maintenance, formatted d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone, where d is the weekday number, from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.

        

      
      - **ImportPath** *(string) --* 

        (Optional) The path to the Amazon S3 bucket (including the optional prefix) that you're using as the data repository for your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. The root of your FSx for Lustre file system will be mapped to the root of the Amazon S3 bucket you select. An example is ``s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix`` . If you specify a prefix after the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are loaded into the file system.

        

      
      - **ExportPath** *(string) --* 

        (Optional) The path in Amazon S3 where the root of your Amazon FSx file system is exported. The path must use the same Amazon S3 bucket as specified in ImportPath. You can provide an optional prefix to which new and changed data is to be exported from your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. If an ``ExportPath`` value is not provided, Amazon FSx sets a default export path, ``s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre[creation-timestamp]`` . The timestamp is in UTC format, for example ``s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre20181105T222312Z`` .

         

        The Amazon S3 export bucket must be the same as the import bucket specified by ``ImportPath`` . If you only specify a bucket name, such as ``s3://import-bucket`` , you get a 1:1 mapping of file system objects to S3 bucket objects. This mapping means that the input data in S3 is overwritten on export. If you provide a custom prefix in the export path, such as ``s3://import-bucket/[custom-optional-prefix]`` , Amazon FSx exports the contents of your file system to that export prefix in the Amazon S3 bucket.

        

      
      - **ImportedFileChunkSize** *(integer) --* 

        (Optional) For files imported from a data repository, this value determines the stripe count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

         

        The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

        

      
      - **DeploymentType** *(string) --* 

        Choose ``SCRATCH_1`` and ``SCRATCH_2`` deployment types when you need temporary storage and shorter-term processing of data. The ``SCRATCH_2`` deployment type provides in-transit encryption of data and higher burst throughput capacity than ``SCRATCH_1`` .

         

        Choose ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment type for longer-term storage and workloads and encryption of data in transit. To learn more about deployment types, see `FSx for Lustre Deployment Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/lustre-deployment-types.html>`__ .

         

        Encryption of data in-transit is automatically enabled when you access a ``SCRATCH_2`` or ``PERSISTENT_1`` file system from Amazon EC2 instances that `support this feature <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/data- protection.html>`__ . (Default = ``SCRATCH_1`` ) 

         

        Encryption of data in-transit for ``SCRATCH_2`` and ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment types is supported when accessed from supported instance types in supported AWS Regions. To learn more, `Encrypting Data in Transit <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/encryption-in-transit-fsxl.html>`__ .

        

      
      - **AutoImportPolicy** *(string) --* 

        (Optional) When you create your file system, your existing S3 objects appear as file and directory listings. Use this property to choose how Amazon FSx keeps your file and directory listings up to date as you add or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket. ``AutoImportPolicy`` can have the following values:

         

         
        * ``NONE`` - (Default) AutoImport is off. Amazon FSx only updates file and directory listings from the linked S3 bucket when the file system is created. FSx does not update file and directory listings for any new or changed objects after choosing this option. 
         
        * ``NEW`` - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports directory listings of any new objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do not currently exist in the FSx file system.  
         
        * ``NEW_CHANGED`` - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports file and directory listings of any new objects added to the S3 bucket and any existing objects that are changed in the S3 bucket after you choose this option.  
         

         

        For more information, see `Automatically import updates from your S3 bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/autoimport-data-repo.html>`__ .

        

      
      - **PerUnitStorageThroughput** *(integer) --* 

        Required for the ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment type, describes the amount of read and write throughput for each 1 tebibyte of storage, in MB/s/TiB. File system throughput capacity is calculated by multiplying ﬁle system storage capacity (TiB) by the PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB). For a 2.4 TiB ﬁle system, provisioning 50 MB/s/TiB of PerUnitStorageThroughput yields 120 MB/s of ﬁle system throughput. You pay for the amount of throughput that you provision. 

         

        Valid values for SSD storage: 50, 100, 200. Valid values for HDD storage: 12, 40.

        

      
      - **DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime** *(string) --* 

        A recurring daily time, in the format ``HH:MM`` . ``HH`` is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and ``MM`` is the zero-padded minute of the hour. For example, ``05:00`` specifies 5 AM daily. 

        

      
      - **AutomaticBackupRetentionDays** *(integer) --* 

        The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this to 0 disables automatic backups. You can retain automatic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 0.

        

      
      - **CopyTagsToBackups** *(boolean) --* 

        (Optional) Not available to use with file systems that are linked to a data repository. A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the file system should be copied to backups. The default value is false. If it's set to true, all file system tags are copied to all automatic and user-initiated backups when the user doesn't specify any backup-specific tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more backup tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the file system, regardless of this value.

         

        For more information, see `Working with backups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-backups-fsx.html>`__ .

        

      
      - **DriveCacheType** *(string) --* 

        The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file systems that are provisioned with HDD storage devices. This parameter is required when storage type is HDD. Set to ``READ`` , improve the performance for frequently accessed files and allows 20% of the total storage capacity of the file system to be cached. 

         

        This parameter is required when ``StorageType`` is set to HDD.

        

      
      - **DataCompressionType** *(string) --* 

        Sets the data compression configuration for the file system. ``DataCompressionType`` can have the following values:

         

         
        * ``NONE`` - (Default) Data compression is turned off when the file system is created. 
         
        * ``LZ4`` - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algorithm. 
         

         

        For more information, see `Lustre data compression <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/data-compression.html>`__ .

        

      
    
    :type StorageType: string
    :param StorageType: 

      Sets the storage type for the Windows file system you're creating from a backup. Valid values are ``SSD`` and ``HDD`` .

       

       
      * Set to ``SSD`` to use solid state drive storage. Supported on all Windows deployment types. 
       
      * Set to ``HDD`` to use hard disk drive storage. Supported on ``SINGLE_AZ_2`` and ``MULTI_AZ_1`` Windows file system deployment types.  
       

       

      Default value is ``SSD`` . 

       

      .. note::

         

        HDD and SSD storage types have different minimum storage capacity requirements. A restored file system's storage capacity is tied to the file system that was backed up. You can create a file system that uses HDD storage from a backup of a file system that used SSD storage only if the original SSD file system had a storage capacity of at least 2000 GiB. 

         

      

    
    :type KmsKeyId: string
    :param KmsKeyId:

                * ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` - Once the ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` task to increase a file system's storage capacity completes successfully, a ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` task starts.  

                   
                  * For Windows, storage optimization is the process of migrating the file system data to the new, larger disks. 
                   
                  * For Lustre, storage optimization consists of rebalancing the data across the existing and newly added file servers. 
                   

                 

                You can track the storage optimization progress using the ``ProgressPercent`` property. When ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` completes successfully, the parent ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` action status changes to ``COMPLETED`` .

  .. py:method:: delete_file_system(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes a file system, deleting its contents. After deletion, the file system no longer exists, and its data is gone. Any existing automatic backups will also be deleted.

     

    By default, when you delete an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, a final backup is created upon deletion. This final backup is not subject to the file system's retention policy, and must be manually deleted.

     

    The ``DeleteFileSystem`` action returns while the file system has the ``DELETING`` status. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the  DescribeFileSystems action, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass the file system ID for a deleted file system, the  DescribeFileSystems returns a ``FileSystemNotFound`` error.

     

    .. note::

       

      Deleting an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system will fail with a 400 BadRequest if a data repository task is in a ``PENDING`` or ``EXECUTING`` state.

       

     

    .. warning::

       

      The data in a deleted file system is also deleted and can't be recovered by any means.

  .. py:method:: describe_backups(**kwargs)

    

    Returns the description of specific Amazon FSx backups, if a ``BackupIds`` value is provided for that backup. Otherwise, it returns all backups owned by your AWS account in the AWS Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

     

    When retrieving all backups, you can optionally specify the ``MaxResults`` parameter to limit the number of backups in a response. If more backups remain, Amazon FSx returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the ``NextToken`` request parameter set to the value of ``NextToken`` from the last response.

     

    This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your backups. ``DescribeBackups`` is called first without a ``NextToken`` value. Then the action continues to be called with the ``NextToken`` parameter set to the value of the last ``NextToken`` value until a response has no ``NextToken`` .

     

    When using this action, keep the following in mind:

     

     
    * The implementation might return fewer than ``MaxResults`` file system descriptions while still including a ``NextToken`` value. 
     
    * The order of backups returned in the response of one ``DescribeBackups`` call and the order of backups returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.

      IDs of the backups you want to retrieve (String). This overrides any filters. If any IDs are not found, BackupNotFound will be thrown.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

        The ID of the source backup. Specifies the backup you are copying.

        

      
  
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      Filters structure. Supported names are file-system-id and backup-type.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter used to restrict the results of describe calls. You can use multiple filters to return results that meet all applied filter requirements.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name for this filter.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The values of the filter. These are all the values for any of the applied filters.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

            The value for a filter.

            

          
      
      
  
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      Maximum number of backups to return in the response (integer). This parameter value must be greater than 0. The number of items that Amazon FSx returns is the minimum of the ``MaxResults`` parameter specified in the request and the service's internal maximum number of items per page.

      

    
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      Opaque pagination token returned from a previous ``DescribeBackups`` operation (String). If a token present, the action continues the list from where the returning call left off.

                  - **ImportedFileChunkSize** *(integer) --* 

                    For files imported from a data repository, this value determines the stripe count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

                     

                    The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                    
                  

                  - **AutoImportPolicy** *(string) --* 

                    Describes the file system's linked S3 data repository's ``AutoImportPolicy`` . The AutoImportPolicy configures how Amazon FSx keeps your file and directory listings up to date as you add or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket. ``AutoImportPolicy`` can have the following values:

                     

                     
                    * ``NONE`` - (Default) AutoImport is off. Amazon FSx only updates file and directory listings from the linked S3 bucket when the file system is created. FSx does not update file and directory listings for any new or changed objects after choosing this option. 
                     
                    * ``NEW`` - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports directory listings of any new objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do not currently exist in the FSx file system.  
                     
                    * ``NEW_CHANGED`` - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports file and directory listings of any new objects added to the S3 bucket and any existing objects that are changed in the S3 bucket after you choose this option.  
                     

                     

                    For more information, see `Automatically import updates from your S3 bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/autoimport-data-repo.html>`__ .

                   ``SCRATCH_1`` and ``SCRATCH_2`` deployment types are best suited for when you need temporary storage and shorter-term processing of data. The ``SCRATCH_2`` deployment type provides in-transit encryption of data and higher burst throughput capacity than ``SCRATCH_1`` .

                   

                  The ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment type is used for longer-term storage and workloads and encryption of data in transit. To learn more about deployment types, see `FSx for Lustre Deployment Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/lustre-deployment-types.html>`__ . (Default = ``SCRATCH_1`` )

                  
                

                - **PerUnitStorageThroughput** *(integer) --* 

                  Per unit storage throughput represents the megabytes per second of read or write throughput per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File system throughput capacity is equal to Storage capacity (TiB) * PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB). This option is only valid for ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment types. 

                   

                  Valid values for SSD storage: 50, 100, 200. Valid values for HDD storage: 12, 40.

                - **AutomaticBackupRetentionDays** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this to 0 disables automatic backups. You can retain automatic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 0.

                  
                

                - **CopyTagsToBackups** *(boolean) --* 

                  A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system should be copied to backups. If it's set to true, all tags on the file system are copied to all automatic backups and any user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify any tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the file system, regardless of this value. (Default = false)

                  
                

                - **DriveCacheType** *(string) --* 

                  The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file systems that are provisioned with HDD storage devices. This parameter is required when storage type is HDD. Set to ``READ`` , improve the performance for frequently accessed files and allows 20% of the total storage capacity of the file system to be cached. 

                   

                  This parameter is required when ``StorageType`` is set to HDD.

                  
                

                - **DataCompressionType** *(string) --*

                    * ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` - A file system update administrative action initiated by the user from the Amazon FSx console, API (UpdateFileSystem), or CLI (update-file-system). 
                     
                    * ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` - Once the ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` task to increase a file system's storage capacity completes successfully, a ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` task starts.  

                       
                      * For Windows, storage optimization is the process of migrating the file system data to the new, larger disks. 
                       
                      * For Lustre, storage optimization consists of rebalancing the data across the existing and newly added file servers. 
                       

                     

                    You can track the storage optimization progress using the ``ProgressPercent`` property. When ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` completes successfully, the parent ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` action status changes to ``COMPLETED`` .

  .. py:method:: describe_data_repository_tasks(**kwargs)

    

    Returns the description of specific Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository tasks, if one or more ``TaskIds`` values are provided in the request, or if filters are used in the request. You can use filters to narrow the response to include just tasks for specific file systems, or tasks in a specific lifecycle state. Otherwise, it returns all data repository tasks owned by your AWS account in the AWS Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

     

    When retrieving all tasks, you can paginate the response by using the optional ``MaxResults`` parameter to limit the number of tasks returned in a response. If more tasks remain, Amazon FSx returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the ``NextToken`` request parameter set to the value of ``NextToken`` from the last response.

              .. note::

                 

                You cannot delete an FSx for Lustre file system if there are data repository tasks for the file system in the ``PENDING`` or ``EXECUTING`` states. Please retry when the data repository task is finished (with a status of ``CANCELED`` , ``SUCCEEDED`` , or ``FAILED`` ). You can use the DescribeDataRepositoryTask action to monitor the task status. Contact the FSx team if you need to delete your file system immediately.

            - **Report** *(dict) --* 

              Provides a report detailing the data repository task results of the files processed that match the criteria specified in the report ``Scope`` parameter. FSx delivers the report to the file system's linked data repository in Amazon S3, using the path specified in the report ``Path`` parameter. You can specify whether or not a report gets generated for a task using the ``Enabled`` parameter.

              
              

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Set ``Enabled`` to ``True`` to generate a ``CompletionReport`` when the task completes. If set to ``true`` , then you need to provide a report ``Scope`` , ``Path`` , and ``Format`` . Set ``Enabled`` to ``False`` if you do not want a ``CompletionReport`` generated when the task completes.

                
              

              - **Path** *(string) --* 

                Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true`` . Specifies the location of the report on the file system's linked S3 data repository. An absolute path that defines where the completion report will be stored in the destination location. The ``Path`` you provide must be located within the file system’s ExportPath. An example ``Path`` value is "s3://myBucket/myExportPath/optionalPrefix". The report provides the following information for each file in the report: FilePath, FileStatus, and ErrorCode. To learn more about a file system's ``ExportPath`` , see .

When ``Format`` is set to ``REPORT_CSV_20191124`` , the ``CompletionReport`` is provided in CSV format, and is delivered to ``{path}/task-{id}/failures.csv`` . 

                
              

              - **Scope** *(string) --* 

                Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true`` . Specifies the scope of the ``CompletionReport`` ; ``FAILED_FILES_ONLY`` is the only scope currently supported. When ``Scope`` is set to ``FAILED_FILES_ONLY`` , the ``CompletionReport`` only contains information about files that the data repository task failed to process.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --*

      - *(dict) --* 

        The response object for ``DescribeFileSystemAliases`` operation.

        
        

        - **Aliases** *(list) --* 

          An array of one or more DNS aliases currently associated with the specified file system.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A DNS alias that is associated with the file system. You can use a DNS alias to access a file system using user-defined DNS names, in addition to the default DNS name that Amazon FSx assigns to the file system. For more information, see `DNS aliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-dns-aliases.html>`__ in the *FSx for Windows File Server User Guide* .

            
            

            - **Name** *(string) --* 

              The name of the DNS alias. The alias name has to meet the following requirements:

               

               
              * Formatted as a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), ``hostname.domain`` , for example, ``accounting.example.com`` . 
               
              * Can contain alphanumeric characters, the underscore (_), and the hyphen (-). 
               
              * Cannot start or end with a hyphen. 
               
              * Can start with a numeric. 
               

               

              For DNS names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters as lowercase letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify them: as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding letters in escape codes.

              
            

            - **Lifecycle** *(string) --* 

              Describes the state of the DNS alias.

               

               
              * AVAILABLE - The DNS alias is associated with an Amazon FSx file system. 
               
              * CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the DNS alias and associating it with the file system. 
               
              * CREATE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable to associate the DNS alias with the file system. 
               
              * DELETING - Amazon FSx is disassociating the DNS alias from the file system and deleting it. 
               
              * DELETE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable to disassocate the DNS alias from the file system. 
               

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          Present if there are more DNS aliases than returned in the response (String). You can use the ``NextToken`` value in a later request to fetch additional descriptions. 

          
    
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`FSx.Client.exceptions.BadRequest`

    
    *     :py:class:`FSx.Client.exceptions.FileSystemNotFound`

    
    *     :py:class:`FSx.Client.exceptions.InternalServerError`

    

  .. py:method:: describe_file_systems(**kwargs)

    

    Returns the description of specific Amazon FSx file systems, if a ``FileSystemIds`` value is provided for that file system. Otherwise, it returns descriptions of all file systems owned by your AWS account in the AWS Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

     

    When retrieving all file system descriptions, you can optionally specify the ``MaxResults`` parameter to limit the number of descriptions in a response. If more file system descriptions remain, Amazon FSx returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the ``NextToken`` request parameter set to the value of ``NextToken`` from the last response.

     

    This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your file system descriptions. ``DescribeFileSystems`` is called first without a ``NextToken`` value. Then the action continues to be called with the ``NextToken`` parameter set to the value of the last ``NextToken`` value until a response has no ``NextToken`` .

     

    When using this action, keep the following in mind:

     

     
    * The implementation might return fewer than ``MaxResults`` file system descriptions while still including a ``NextToken`` value. 
     
    * The order of file systems returned in the response of one ``DescribeFileSystems`` call and the order of file systems returned across the responses of a multicall iteration is unspecified.

                  * ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` - Once the ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` task to increase a file system's storage capacity completes successfully, a ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` task starts.  

                     
                    * For Windows, storage optimization is the process of migrating the file system data to the new, larger disks. 
                     
                    * For Lustre, storage optimization consists of rebalancing the data across the existing and newly added file servers. 
                     

                   

                  You can track the storage optimization progress using the ``ProgressPercent`` property. When ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` completes successfully, the parent ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` action status changes to ``COMPLETED`` . For more information, see `Managing storage capacity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html>`__ in the *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide* and `Managing storage and throughput capacity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html>`__ in the *Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide* . 

                   
                   
                  * ``FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_ASSOCIATION`` - A file system update to associate a new DNS alias with the file system. For more information, see . 
                   
                  * ``FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_DISASSOCIATION`` - A file system update to disassociate a DNS alias from the file system. For more information, see . 
                   

                  
                

                - **ProgressPercent** *(integer) --* 

                  Provides the percent complete of a ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` administrative action. Does not apply to any other administrative action type.

                  
                

                - **RequestTime** *(datetime) --* 

                  Time that the administrative action request was received.

                  
                

                - **Status** *(string) --* 

                  Describes the status of the administrative action, as follows:

                   

                   
                  * ``FAILED`` - Amazon FSx failed to process the administrative action successfully. 
                   
                  * ``IN_PROGRESS`` - Amazon FSx is processing the administrative action. 
                   
                  * ``PENDING`` - Amazon FSx is waiting to process the administrative action. 
                   
                  * ``COMPLETED`` - Amazon FSx has finished processing the administrative task. 
                   
                  * ``UPDATED_OPTIMIZING`` - For a storage capacity increase update, Amazon FSx has updated the file system with the new storage capacity, and is now performing the storage optimization process. For more information, see `Managing storage capacity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html>`__ in the *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide* and `Managing storage and throughput capacity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html>`__ in the *Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide* .

          An array of one or more DNS aliases that Amazon FSx is attempting to disassociate from the file system.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A DNS alias that is associated with the file system. You can use a DNS alias to access a file system using user-defined DNS names, in addition to the default DNS name that Amazon FSx assigns to the file system. For more information, see `DNS aliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-dns-aliases.html>`__ in the *FSx for Windows File Server User Guide* .

            
            

            - **Name** *(string) --* 

              The name of the DNS alias. The alias name has to meet the following requirements:

               

               
              * Formatted as a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), ``hostname.domain`` , for example, ``accounting.example.com`` . 
               
              * Can contain alphanumeric characters, the underscore (_), and the hyphen (-). 
               
              * Cannot start or end with a hyphen. 
               
              * Can start with a numeric. 
               

               

              For DNS names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters as lowercase letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify them: as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding letters in escape codes.

              
            

            - **Lifecycle** *(string) --* 

              Describes the state of the DNS alias.

    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :raise OperationNotPageableError: Raised if the operation is not
        pageable.  You can use the ``client.can_paginate`` method to
        check if an operation is pageable.

    :param waiter_name: The name of the waiter to get. See the waiters
        section of the service docs for a list of available waiters.
    
    :returns: The specified waiter object.
    :rtype: botocore.waiter.Waiter


  .. py:method:: list_tags_for_resource(**kwargs)

    

    Lists tags for an Amazon FSx file systems and backups in the case of Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.

     

    When retrieving all tags, you can optionally specify the ``MaxResults`` parameter to limit the number of tags in a response. If more tags remain, Amazon FSx returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the ``NextToken`` request parameter set to the value of ``NextToken`` from the last response.

     

    This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your tags. ``ListTagsForResource`` is called first without a ``NextToken`` value. Then the action continues to be called with the ``NextToken`` parameter set to the value of the last ``NextToken`` value until a response has no ``NextToken`` .

     

    When using this action, keep the following in mind:

     

     
    * The implementation might return fewer than ``MaxResults`` file system descriptions while still including a ``NextToken`` value. 
     
    * The order of tags returned in the response of one ``ListTagsForResource`` call and the order of tags returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.

    :type ClientRequestToken: string
    :param ClientRequestToken: 

      A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent updates. This string is automatically filled on your behalf when you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or an AWS SDK.

      This field is autopopulated if not provided.

    
    :type StorageCapacity: integer
    :param StorageCapacity: 

      Use this parameter to increase the storage capacity of an Amazon FSx file system. Specifies the storage capacity target value, GiB, to increase the storage capacity for the file system that you're updating. You cannot make a storage capacity increase request if there is an existing storage capacity increase request in progress.

       

      For Windows file systems, the storage capacity target value must be at least 10 percent (%) greater than the current storage capacity value. In order to increase storage capacity, the file system must have at least 16 MB/s of throughput capacity.

       

      For Lustre file systems, the storage capacity target value can be the following:

       

       
      * For ``SCRATCH_2`` and ``PERSISTENT_1 SSD`` deployment types, valid values are in multiples of 2400 GiB. The value must be greater than the current storage capacity. 
       
      * For ``PERSISTENT HDD`` file systems, valid values are multiples of 6000 GiB for 12 MB/s/TiB file systems and multiples of 1800 GiB for 40 MB/s/TiB file systems. The values must be greater than the current storage capacity. 
       
      * For ``SCRATCH_1`` file systems, you cannot increase the storage capacity.

If a prefix is specified after the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are loaded into the file system.

                
              

              - **ExportPath** *(string) --* 

                The export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix) that you are using to store new and changed Lustre file system files in S3.

                
              

              - **ImportedFileChunkSize** *(integer) --* 

                For files imported from a data repository, this value determines the stripe count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

                 

                The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                
              

              - **AutoImportPolicy** *(string) --* 

                Describes the file system's linked S3 data repository's ``AutoImportPolicy`` . The AutoImportPolicy configures how Amazon FSx keeps your file and directory listings up to date as you add or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket. ``AutoImportPolicy`` can have the following values:

                 

                 
                * ``NONE`` - (Default) AutoImport is off. Amazon FSx only updates file and directory listings from the linked S3 bucket when the file system is created. FSx does not update file and directory listings for any new or changed objects after choosing this option. 
                 
                * ``NEW`` - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports directory listings of any new objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do not currently exist in the FSx file system.  
                 
                * ``NEW_CHANGED`` - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports file and directory listings of any new objects added to the S3 bucket and any existing objects that are changed in the S3 bucket after you choose this option.  
                 

                 

                For more information, see `Automatically import updates from your S3 bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/autoimport-data-repo.html>`__ .

                
              

              - **FailureDetails** *(dict) --* 

                Provides detailed information about the data respository if its ``Lifecycle`` is set to ``MISCONFIGURED`` .

            - **DeploymentType** *(string) --* 

              The deployment type of the FSX for Lustre file system. *Scratch deployment type* is designed for temporary storage and shorter-term processing of data.

               

               ``SCRATCH_1`` and ``SCRATCH_2`` deployment types are best suited for when you need temporary storage and shorter-term processing of data. The ``SCRATCH_2`` deployment type provides in-transit encryption of data and higher burst throughput capacity than ``SCRATCH_1`` .

               

              The ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment type is used for longer-term storage and workloads and encryption of data in transit. To learn more about deployment types, see `FSx for Lustre Deployment Options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/lustre-deployment-types.html>`__ . (Default = ``SCRATCH_1`` )

              
            

            - **PerUnitStorageThroughput** *(integer) --* 

              Per unit storage throughput represents the megabytes per second of read or write throughput per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File system throughput capacity is equal to Storage capacity (TiB) * PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB). This option is only valid for ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment types. 

               

              Valid values for SSD storage: 50, 100, 200. Valid values for HDD storage: 12, 40. 

              
            

            - **MountName** *(string) --* 

              You use the ``MountName`` value when mounting the file system.

               

              For the ``SCRATCH_1`` deployment type, this value is always "``fsx`` ". For ``SCRATCH_2`` and ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment types, this value is a string that is unique within an AWS Region. 

              
            

            - **DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime** *(string) --* 

              A recurring daily time, in the format ``HH:MM`` . ``HH`` is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and ``MM`` is the zero-padded minute of the hour. For example, ``05:00`` specifies 5 AM daily. 

              
            

            - **AutomaticBackupRetentionDays** *(integer) --* 

              The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this to 0 disables automatic backups. You can retain automatic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 0.

              
            

            - **CopyTagsToBackups** *(boolean) --* 

              A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system should be copied to backups. If it's set to true, all tags on the file system are copied to all automatic backups and any user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify any tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the file system, regardless of this value. (Default = false)

              
            

            - **DriveCacheType** *(string) --* 

              The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file systems that are provisioned with HDD storage devices. This parameter is required when storage type is HDD. Set to ``READ`` , improve the performance for frequently accessed files and allows 20% of the total storage capacity of the file system to be cached. 

               

              This parameter is required when ``StorageType`` is set to HDD.

              
            

            - **DataCompressionType** *(string) --* 

              The data compression configuration for the file system. ``DataCompressionType`` can have the following values:

               

               
              * ``NONE`` - Data compression is turned off for the file system. 
               
              * ``LZ4`` - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algorithm. 
               

               

              For more information, see `Lustre data compression <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/data-compression.html>`__ .

              
        
          

          - **AdministrativeActions** *(list) --* 

            A list of administrative actions for the file system that are in process or waiting to be processed. Administrative actions describe changes to the Windows file system that you have initiated using the ``UpdateFileSystem`` action. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative action for the current Windows or Lustre file system.

              
              

              - **AdministrativeActionType** *(string) --* 

                Describes the type of administrative action, as follows:

                * ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` - Once the ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` task to increase a file system's storage capacity completes successfully, a ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` task starts.  

                   
                  * For Windows, storage optimization is the process of migrating the file system data to the new, larger disks. 
                   
                  * For Lustre, storage optimization consists of rebalancing the data across the existing and newly added file servers. 
                   

                 

                You can track the storage optimization progress using the ``ProgressPercent`` property. When ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` completes successfully, the parent ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` action status changes to ``COMPLETED`` . For more information, see `Managing storage capacity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html>`__ in the *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide* and `Managing storage and throughput capacity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html>`__ in the *Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide* .

              - **ProgressPercent** *(integer) --* 

                Provides the percent complete of a ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` administrative action. Does not apply to any other administrative action type.

                
              

              - **RequestTime** *(datetime) --* 

                Time that the administrative action request was received.

                
              

              - **Status** *(string) --* 

                Describes the status of the administrative action, as follows:

                 

                 
                * ``FAILED`` - Amazon FSx failed to process the administrative action successfully. 
                 
                * ``IN_PROGRESS`` - Amazon FSx is processing the administrative action. 
                 
                * ``PENDING`` - Amazon FSx is waiting to process the administrative action. 
                 
                * ``COMPLETED`` - Amazon FSx has finished processing the administrative task. 
                 
                * ``UPDATED_OPTIMIZING`` - For a storage capacity increase update, Amazon FSx has updated the file system with the new storage capacity, and is now performing the storage optimization process.

                  For the ``SCRATCH_1`` deployment type, this value is always "``fsx`` ". For ``SCRATCH_2`` and ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment types, this value is a string that is unique within an AWS Region. 

                  
                

                - **DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime** *(string) --* 

                  A recurring daily time, in the format ``HH:MM`` . ``HH`` is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and ``MM`` is the zero-padded minute of the hour. For example, ``05:00`` specifies 5 AM daily. 

                  
                

                - **AutomaticBackupRetentionDays** *(integer) --* 

                  The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this to 0 disables automatic backups. You can retain automatic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 0.

If it's set to true, all tags on the file system are copied to all automatic backups and any user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify any tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the file system, regardless of this value. (Default = false)

                  
                

                - **DriveCacheType** *(string) --* 

                  The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file systems that are provisioned with HDD storage devices. This parameter is required when storage type is HDD. Set to ``READ`` , improve the performance for frequently accessed files and allows 20% of the total storage capacity of the file system to be cached. 

                   

                  This parameter is required when ``StorageType`` is set to HDD.

                - *(dict) --* 

                  Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative action for the current Windows or Lustre file system.

                  
                  

                  - **AdministrativeActionType** *(string) --* 

                    Describes the type of administrative action, as follows:

                     

                     
                    * ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` - A file system update administrative action initiated by the user from the Amazon FSx console, API (UpdateFileSystem), or CLI (update-file-system). 
                     
                    * ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` - Once the ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` task to increase a file system's storage capacity completes successfully, a ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` task starts.  

                       
                      * For Windows, storage optimization is the process of migrating the file system data to the new, larger disks. 
                       
                      * For Lustre, storage optimization consists of rebalancing the data across the existing and newly added file servers. 
                       

                     

                    You can track the storage optimization progress using the ``ProgressPercent`` property. When ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` completes successfully, the parent ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` action status changes to ``COMPLETED`` . For more information, see `Managing storage capacity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html>`__ in the *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide* and `Managing storage and throughput capacity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html>`__ in the *Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide* .

                  - **Status** *(string) --* 

                    Describes the status of the administrative action, as follows:

                     

                     
                    * ``FAILED`` - Amazon FSx failed to process the administrative action successfully. 
                     
                    * ``IN_PROGRESS`` - Amazon FSx is processing the administrative action. 
                     
                    * ``PENDING`` - Amazon FSx is waiting to process the administrative action. 
                     
                    * ``COMPLETED`` - Amazon FSx has finished processing the administrative task. 
                     
                    * ``UPDATED_OPTIMIZING`` - For a storage capacity increase update, Amazon FSx has updated the file system with the new storage capacity, and is now performing the storage optimization process.

                For the ``SCRATCH_1`` deployment type, this value is always "``fsx`` ". For ``SCRATCH_2`` and ``PERSISTENT_1`` deployment types, this value is a string that is unique within an AWS Region. 

                
              

              - **DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime** *(string) --* 

                A recurring daily time, in the format ``HH:MM`` . ``HH`` is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and ``MM`` is the zero-padded minute of the hour. For example, ``05:00`` specifies 5 AM daily. 

                
              

              - **AutomaticBackupRetentionDays** *(integer) --* 

                The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this to 0 disables automatic backups. You can retain automatic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 0.

                
              

              - **CopyTagsToBackups** *(boolean) --* 

                A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system should be copied to backups. If it's set to true, all tags on the file system are copied to all automatic backups and any user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify any tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the file system, regardless of this value. (Default = false)

                
              

              - **DriveCacheType** *(string) --* 

                The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file systems that are provisioned with HDD storage devices. This parameter is required when storage type is HDD. Set to ``READ`` , improve the performance for frequently accessed files and allows 20% of the total storage capacity of the file system to be cached. 

                 

                This parameter is required when ``StorageType`` is set to HDD.

                
              

              - **DataCompressionType** *(string) --* 

                The data compression configuration for the file system. ``DataCompressionType`` can have the following values:

                 

                 
                * ``NONE`` - Data compression is turned off for the file system. 
                 
                * ``LZ4`` - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algorithm. 
                 

                 

                For more information, see `Lustre data compression <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/data-compression.html>`__ .

                  * ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` - Once the ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` task to increase a file system's storage capacity completes successfully, a ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` task starts.  

                     
                    * For Windows, storage optimization is the process of migrating the file system data to the new, larger disks. 
                     
                    * For Lustre, storage optimization consists of rebalancing the data across the existing and newly added file servers. 
                     

                   

                  You can track the storage optimization progress using the ``ProgressPercent`` property. When ``STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION`` completes successfully, the parent ``FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`` action status changes to ``COMPLETED`` .
