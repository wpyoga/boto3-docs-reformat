  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: create_app(**kwargs)

      )
    :type EmailTemplateRequest: dict
    :param EmailTemplateRequest: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the content and settings for a message template that can be used in messages that are sent through the email channel.

      

    
      - **DefaultSubstitutions** *(string) --* 

        A JSON object that specifies the default values to use for message variables in the message template. This object is a set of key-value pairs. Each key defines a message variable in the template. The corresponding value defines the default value for that variable. When you create a message that's based on the template, you can override these defaults with message-specific and address-specific variables and values.

        

      
      - **HtmlPart** *(string) --* 

        The message body, in HTML format, to use in email messages that are based on the message template. We recommend using HTML format for email clients that render HTML content. You can include links, formatted text, and more in an HTML message.

        

      
      - **RecommenderId** *(string) --* 

        The unique identifier for the recommender model to use for the message template. Amazon Pinpoint uses this value to determine how to retrieve and process data from a recommender model when it sends messages that use the template, if the template contains message variables for recommendation data.

        

      
      - **Subject** *(string) --* 

        The subject line, or title, to use in email messages that are based on the message template.

        

      
      - **tags** *(dict) --* 

        A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that defines the tags to associate with the message template. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
          - *(string) --*

        A custom description of the message template.

        

      
      - **TextPart** *(string) --* 

        The message body, in plain text format, to use in email messages that are based on the message template. We recommend using plain text format for email clients that don't render HTML content and clients that are connected to high-latency networks, such as mobile devices.

        

      
    
    :type TemplateName: string
    :param TemplateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the message template. A template name must start with an alphanumeric character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters. The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

        The URL of the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that contains the endpoint definitions to import. This location can be a folder or a single file. If the location is a folder, Amazon Pinpoint imports endpoint definitions from the files in this location, including any subfolders that the folder contains.

         

        The URL should be in the following format: s3://bucket-name/folder-name/file-name. The location can end with the key for an individual object or a prefix that qualifies multiple objects.

        

      
      - **SegmentId** *(string) --* 

        The identifier for the segment to update or add the imported endpoint definitions to, if the import job is meant to update an existing segment.

        

      
      - **SegmentName** *(string) --* 

        A custom name for the segment that's created by the import job, if the value of the DefineSegment property is true.

            The resource settings that apply to the import job.

            
            

            - **DefineSegment** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether the import job creates a segment that contains the endpoints, when the endpoint definitions are imported.

              
            

            - **ExternalId** *(string) --* 

              (Deprecated) Your AWS account ID, which you assigned to an external ID key in an IAM trust policy. Amazon Pinpoint previously used this value to assume an IAM role when importing endpoint definitions, but we removed this requirement. We don't recommend use of external IDs for IAM roles that are assumed by Amazon Pinpoint.

              
            

            - **Format** *(string) --* 

              The format of the files that contain the endpoint definitions to import. Valid values are: CSV, for comma-separated values format; and, JSON, for newline-delimited JSON format.

               

              If the files are stored in an Amazon S3 location and that location contains multiple files that use different formats, Amazon Pinpoint imports data only from the files that use the specified format.

              
            

            - **RegisterEndpoints** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether the import job registers the endpoints with Amazon Pinpoint, when the endpoint definitions are imported.

              
            

            - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to access the Amazon S3 location to import endpoint definitions from.

              
            

            - **S3Url** *(string) --* 

              The URL of the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that contains the endpoint definitions to import. This location can be a folder or a single file. If the location is a folder, Amazon Pinpoint imports endpoint definitions from the files in this location, including any subfolders that the folder contains.

               

              The URL should be in the following format: s3://bucket-name/folder-name/file-name. The location can end with the key for an individual object or a prefix that qualifies multiple objects.

              
            

            - **SegmentId** *(string) --* 

              The identifier for the segment that the import job updates or adds endpoint definitions to, if the import job updates an existing segment.

              
            

            - **SegmentName** *(string) --* 

              The custom name for the segment that's created by the import job, if the value of the DefineSegment property is true.

              
        
          

          - **FailedPieces** *(integer) --* 

            The number of pieces that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the import job, as of the time of the request.

            
          

          - **Failures** *(list) --* 

            An array of entries, one for each of the first 100 entries that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the import job, if any.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the import job.

            
          

          - **JobStatus** *(string) --* 

            The status of the import job. The job status is FAILED if Amazon Pinpoint wasn't able to process one or more pieces in the job.

            
          

          - **TotalFailures** *(integer) --* 

            The total number of endpoint definitions that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the import job, typically because an error, such as a syntax error, occurred.

            
          

          - **TotalPieces** *(integer) --* 

            The total number of pieces that must be processed to complete the import job. Each piece consists of an approximately equal portion of the endpoint definitions that are part of the import job.

            
          

          - **TotalProcessed** *(integer) --* 

            The total number of endpoint definitions that were processed by the import job.

            
          

          - **Type** *(string) --* 

            The job type. This value is IMPORT for import jobs.

          - **SegmentId** *(string) --* 

          
        
        - **SegmentStartCondition** *(dict) --* 

          The segment that's associated with the first activity in the journey. This segment determines which users are participants in the journey.

          

        
          - **SegmentId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The unique identifier for the segment to associate with the activity.

            

          
        
      
      - **State** *(string) --* 

        The status of the journey. Valid values are:

         

        
        * DRAFT - Saves the journey and doesn't publish it.
         
        * ACTIVE - Saves and publishes the journey. Depending on the journey's schedule, the journey starts running immediately or at the scheduled start time. If a journey's status is ACTIVE, you can't add, change, or remove activities from it.
        

         

        PAUSED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED, and CLOSED states are not supported in requests to create or update a journey. To cancel, pause, or resume a journey, use the Journey Stateresource.

        

      
      - **WaitForQuietTime** *(boolean) --* 

        Specifies whether endpoints in quiet hours should enter a wait till the end of their quiet hours.

        * PINPOINT_ENDPOINT_ID - Associate each user in the model with a particular endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is correlated based on endpoint IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. This is the default value.
         
        * PINPOINT_USER_ID - Associate each user in the model with a particular user and endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is correlated based on user IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. If you specify this value, an endpoint definition in Amazon Pinpoint has to specify both a user ID (UserId) and an endpoint ID. Otherwise, messages won’t be sent to the user's endpoint.
        

        

      
      - **RecommendationProviderRoleArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to retrieve recommendation data from the recommender model.

        

      
      - **RecommendationProviderUri** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recommender model to retrieve recommendation data from. This value must match the ARN of an Amazon Personalize campaign.

        

      
      - **RecommendationTransformerUri** *(string) --* 

        The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Lambda function to invoke for additional processing of recommendation data that's retrieved from the recommender model.

        

      
      - **RecommendationsDisplayName** *(string) --* 

        A custom display name for the standard endpoint or user attribute (RecommendationItems) that temporarily stores recommended items for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. This value is required if the configuration doesn't invoke an AWS Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform additional processing of recommendation data.

         

        This name appears in the **Attribute finder** of the template editor on the Amazon Pinpoint console. The name can contain up to 25 characters. The characters can be letters, numbers, spaces, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). These restrictions don't apply to attribute values.

        

      
      - **RecommendationsPerMessage** *(integer) --* 

        The number of recommended items to retrieve from the model for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. This number determines how many recommended items are available for use in message variables. The minimum value is 1. The maximum value is 5. The default value is 5.

         

        To use multiple recommended items and custom attributes with message variables, you have to use an AWS Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform additional processing of recommendation data.

                            * EXCLUSIVE - endpoints that have attributes matching the values are excluded in the segment.
                            
                            * CONTAINS - endpoints that have attributes' substrings match the values are included in the segment.
                            
                            * BEFORE - endpoints with attributes read as ISO_INSTANT datetimes before the value are included in the segment.
                            
                            * AFTER - endpoints with attributes read as ISO_INSTANT datetimes after the value are included in the segment.
                            
                            * ON - endpoints with attributes read as ISO_INSTANT dates on the value are included in the segment. Time is ignored in this comparison.
                            
                            * BETWEEN - endpoints with attributes read as ISO_INSTANT datetimes between the values are included in the segment.
                            

                            

                            
                          

                          - **Values** *(list) --* 

                            The criteria values to use for the segment dimension. Depending on the value of the AttributeType property, endpoints are included or excluded from the segment if their attribute values match the criteria values.

                - **SourceSegments** *(list) --* 

                  The base segment to build the segment on. A base segment, also referred to as a *source segment* , defines the initial population of endpoints for a segment. When you add dimensions to a segment, Amazon Pinpoint filters the base segment by using the dimensions that you specify.

                   

                  You can specify more than one dimensional segment or only one imported segment. If you specify an imported segment, the Amazon Pinpoint console displays a segment size estimate that indicates the size of the imported segment without any filters applied to it.

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --*

                    - **Version** *(integer) --* 

                      The version number of the segment.

                      
                
              
                

                - **SourceType** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies how to handle multiple base segments for the segment. For example, if you specify three base segments for the segment, whether the resulting segment is based on all, any, or none of the base segments.

                  
                

                - **Type** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies how to handle multiple dimensions for the segment. For example, if you specify three dimensions for the segment, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the dimensions.

                  
            
          
            

            - **Include** *(string) --* 

              Specifies how to handle multiple segment groups for the segment. For example, if the segment includes three segment groups, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the segment groups.

              
        
          

          - **SegmentType** *(string) --* 

            The segment type. Valid values are:

             

            
            * DIMENSIONAL - A dynamic segment, which is a segment that uses selection criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint data that's reported by your app. Dynamic segments can change over time.
             
            * IMPORT - A static segment, which is a segment that uses selection criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint definitions that you import from a file. Imported segments are static; they don't change over time.
            

            
          

          - **tags** *(dict) --* 

            A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that identifies the tags that are associated with the segment. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.

            
            

            - *(string) --*

          TemplateName='string',
          Version='string'
      )
    :type TemplateName: string
    :param TemplateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the message template. A template name must start with an alphanumeric character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters. The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

      

    
    :type Version: string
    :param Version: 

      The unique identifier for the version of the message template to update, retrieve information about, or delete. To retrieve identifiers and other information for all the versions of a template, use the Template Versionsresource.

       

      If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. If specified for an update operation, this value must match the identifier for the latest existing version of the template. This restriction helps ensure that race conditions don't occur.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint does the following:

       

      
      * For a get operation, retrieves information about the active version of the template.
       
      * For an update operation, saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version parameter isn't used or is set to false.
       
      * For a delete operation, deletes the template, including all versions of the template.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        The request succeeded.

        
        

        - **RecommenderConfigurationResponse** *(dict) --* 

          Provides information about Amazon Pinpoint configuration settings for retrieving and processing data from a recommender model.

          
          

          - **Attributes** *(dict) --* 

            A map that defines 1-10 custom endpoint or user attributes, depending on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. Each of these attributes temporarily stores a recommended item that's retrieved from the recommender model and sent to an AWS Lambda function for additional processing. Each attribute can be used as a message variable in a message template.

             

            This value is null if the configuration doesn't invoke an AWS Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform additional processing of recommendation data.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
              

              - *(string) --* 
        
      
          

          - **CreationDate** *(string) --* 

            The date, in extended ISO 8601 format, when the configuration was created for the recommender model.

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            The custom description of the configuration for the recommender model.

            
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the recommender model configuration.

            
          

          - **LastModifiedDate** *(string) --* 

            The date, in extended ISO 8601 format, when the configuration for the recommender model was last modified.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The custom name of the configuration for the recommender model.

            
          

          - **RecommendationProviderIdType** *(string) --* 

            The type of Amazon Pinpoint ID that's associated with unique user IDs in the recommender model. This value enables the model to use attribute and event data that’s specific to a particular endpoint or user in an Amazon Pinpoint application. Possible values are:

             

            
            * PINPOINT_ENDPOINT_ID - Each user in the model is associated with a particular endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is correlated based on endpoint IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. This is the default value.
             
            * PINPOINT_USER_ID - Each user in the model is associated with a particular user and endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is correlated based on user IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. If this value is specified, an endpoint definition in Amazon Pinpoint has to specify both a user ID (UserId) and an endpoint ID. Otherwise, messages won’t be sent to the user's endpoint.
            

            
          

          - **RecommendationProviderRoleArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to retrieve recommendation data from the recommender model.

            
          

          - **RecommendationProviderUri** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recommender model that Amazon Pinpoint retrieves the recommendation data from. This value is the ARN of an Amazon Personalize campaign.

            
          

          - **RecommendationTransformerUri** *(string) --* 

            The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Lambda function that Amazon Pinpoint invokes to perform additional processing of recommendation data that it retrieves from the recommender model.

            
          

          - **RecommendationsDisplayName** *(string) --* 

            The custom display name for the standard endpoint or user attribute (RecommendationItems) that temporarily stores recommended items for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. This name appears in the **Attribute finder** of the template editor on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

             

            This value is null if the configuration doesn't invoke an AWS Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform additional processing of recommendation data.

            
          

          - **RecommendationsPerMessage** *(integer) --* 

            The number of recommended items that are retrieved from the model for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. This number determines how many recommended items are available for use in message variables.

                  You can specify more than one dimensional segment or only one imported segment. If you specify an imported segment, the Amazon Pinpoint console displays a segment size estimate that indicates the size of the imported segment without any filters applied to it.

                - **SourceType** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies how to handle multiple base segments for the segment. For example, if you specify three base segments for the segment, whether the resulting segment is based on all, any, or none of the base segments.

                  
                

                - **Type** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies how to handle multiple dimensions for the segment. For example, if you specify three dimensions for the segment, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the dimensions.

          - **SegmentType** *(string) --* 

            The segment type. Valid values are:

             

            
            * DIMENSIONAL - A dynamic segment, which is a segment that uses selection criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint data that's reported by your app. Dynamic segments can change over time.
             
            * IMPORT - A static segment, which is a segment that uses selection criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint definitions that you import from a file. Imported segments are static; they don't change over time.
            

            
          

          - **tags** *(dict) --* 

            A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that identifies the tags that are associated with the segment. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.

      )
    :type TemplateName: string
    :param TemplateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the message template. A template name must start with an alphanumeric character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters. The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

      

    
    :type Version: string
    :param Version: 

      The unique identifier for the version of the message template to update, retrieve information about, or delete. To retrieve identifiers and other information for all the versions of a template, use the Template Versionsresource.

       

      If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. If specified for an update operation, this value must match the identifier for the latest existing version of the template. This restriction helps ensure that race conditions don't occur.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint does the following:

       

      
      * For a get operation, retrieves information about the active version of the template.
       
      * For an update operation, saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version parameter isn't used or is set to false.
       
      * For a delete operation, deletes the template, including all versions of the template.

    :type TemplateName: string
    :param TemplateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the message template. A template name must start with an alphanumeric character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters. The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

      

    
    :type Version: string
    :param Version: 

      The unique identifier for the version of the message template to update, retrieve information about, or delete. To retrieve identifiers and other information for all the versions of a template, use the Template Versionsresource.

       

      If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. If specified for an update operation, this value must match the identifier for the latest existing version of the template. This restriction helps ensure that race conditions don't occur.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint does the following:

       

      
      * For a get operation, retrieves information about the active version of the template.
       
      * For an update operation, saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version parameter isn't used or is set to false.
       
      * For a delete operation, deletes the template, including all versions of the template.

    :type TemplateName: string
    :param TemplateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the message template. A template name must start with an alphanumeric character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters. The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

      

    
    :type Version: string
    :param Version: 

      The unique identifier for the version of the message template to update, retrieve information about, or delete. To retrieve identifiers and other information for all the versions of a template, use the Template Versionsresource.

       

      If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. If specified for an update operation, this value must match the identifier for the latest existing version of the template. This restriction helps ensure that race conditions don't occur.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint does the following:

       

      
      * For a get operation, retrieves information about the active version of the template.
       
      * For an update operation, saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version parameter isn't used or is set to false.
       
      * For a delete operation, deletes the template, including all versions of the template.

      - *(dict) --* 

        The request succeeded.

        
        

        - **ImportJobsResponse** *(dict) --* 

          Provides information about the status and settings of all the import jobs that are associated with an application or segment. An import job is a job that imports endpoint definitions from one or more files.

          
          

          - **Item** *(list) --* 

            An array of responses, one for each import job that's associated with the application (Import Jobs resource) or segment (Segment Import Jobs resource).

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Provides information about the status and settings of a job that imports endpoint definitions from one or more files. The files can be stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or uploaded directly from a computer by using the Amazon Pinpoint console.

              
              

              - **ApplicationId** *(string) --* 

                The unique identifier for the application that's associated with the import job.

                
              

              - **CompletedPieces** *(integer) --* 

                The number of pieces that were processed successfully (completed) by the import job, as of the time of the request.

                
              

              - **CompletionDate** *(string) --* 

                The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the import job was completed.

                
              

              - **CreationDate** *(string) --* 

                The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the import job was created.

                
              

              - **Definition** *(dict) --* 

                The resource settings that apply to the import job.

                
                

                - **DefineSegment** *(boolean) --* 

                  Specifies whether the import job creates a segment that contains the endpoints, when the endpoint definitions are imported.

                  
                

                - **ExternalId** *(string) --* 

                  (Deprecated) Your AWS account ID, which you assigned to an external ID key in an IAM trust policy. Amazon Pinpoint previously used this value to assume an IAM role when importing endpoint definitions, but we removed this requirement. We don't recommend use of external IDs for IAM roles that are assumed by Amazon Pinpoint.

                  
                

                - **Format** *(string) --* 

                  The format of the files that contain the endpoint definitions to import. Valid values are: CSV, for comma-separated values format; and, JSON, for newline-delimited JSON format.

                   

                  If the files are stored in an Amazon S3 location and that location contains multiple files that use different formats, Amazon Pinpoint imports data only from the files that use the specified format.

                  
                

                - **RegisterEndpoints** *(boolean) --* 

                  Specifies whether the import job registers the endpoints with Amazon Pinpoint, when the endpoint definitions are imported.

                  
                

                - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to access the Amazon S3 location to import endpoint definitions from.

                  
                

                - **S3Url** *(string) --* 

                  The URL of the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that contains the endpoint definitions to import. This location can be a folder or a single file. If the location is a folder, Amazon Pinpoint imports endpoint definitions from the files in this location, including any subfolders that the folder contains.

                   

                  The URL should be in the following format: s3://bucket-name/folder-name/file-name. The location can end with the key for an individual object or a prefix that qualifies multiple objects.

                  
                

                - **SegmentId** *(string) --* 

                  The identifier for the segment that the import job updates or adds endpoint definitions to, if the import job updates an existing segment.

                  
                

                - **SegmentName** *(string) --* 

                  The custom name for the segment that's created by the import job, if the value of the DefineSegment property is true.

                  
            
              

              - **FailedPieces** *(integer) --* 

                The number of pieces that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the import job, as of the time of the request.

                
              

              - **Failures** *(list) --* 

                An array of entries, one for each of the first 100 entries that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the import job, if any.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **Id** *(string) --* 

                The unique identifier for the import job.

                
              

              - **JobStatus** *(string) --* 

                The status of the import job. The job status is FAILED if Amazon Pinpoint wasn't able to process one or more pieces in the job.

                
              

              - **TotalFailures** *(integer) --* 

                The total number of endpoint definitions that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the import job, typically because an error, such as a syntax error, occurred.

                
              

              - **TotalPieces** *(integer) --* 

                The total number of pieces that must be processed to complete the import job. Each piece consists of an approximately equal portion of the endpoint definitions that are part of the import job.

                
              

              - **TotalProcessed** *(integer) --* 

                The total number of endpoint definitions that were processed by the import job.

                
              

              - **Type** *(string) --* 

                The job type. This value is IMPORT for import jobs.

                    * The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Lambda function to invoke to handle delivery of the campaign or treatment.
                     
                    * The URL for a web application or service that supports HTTPS and can receive the message. The URL has to be a full URL, including the HTTPS protocol.
                    

                    
                  

                  - **EndpointTypes** *(list) --* 

                    The types of endpoints to send the custom message to. Each valid value maps to a type of channel that you can associate with an endpoint by using the ChannelType property of an endpoint.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
                  

                  - **MessageConfig** *(dict) --* 

                    Specifies the message data included in a custom channel message that's sent to participants in a journey.

                    
                    

                    - **Data** *(string) --* 

                      The message content that's passed to an AWS Lambda function or to a web hook.

                      
                
                  

                  - **NextActivity** *(string) --* 

                    The unique identifier for the next activity to perform, after Amazon Pinpoint calls the AWS Lambda function or web hook.

                    
                  

                  - **TemplateName** *(string) --* 

                    The name of the custom message template to use for the message. If specified, this value must match the name of an existing message template.

                    
                  

                  - **TemplateVersion** *(string) --* 

                    The unique identifier for the version of the message template to use for the message. If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version.

                  - **TemplateName** *(string) --* 

                    The name of the email message template to use for the message. If specified, this value must match the name of an existing message template.

                    
                  

                  - **TemplateVersion** *(string) --* 

                    The unique identifier for the version of the email template to use for the message. If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. To retrieve a list of versions and version identifiers for a template, use the Template Versionsresource.

                     

                    If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint uses the *active version* of the template. The *active version* is typically the version of a template that's been most recently reviewed and approved for use, depending on your workflow. It isn't necessarily the latest version of a template.

                    The percentage of participants who shouldn't continue the journey.

                     

                    To determine which participants are held out, Amazon Pinpoint applies a probability-based algorithm to the percentage that you specify. Therefore, the actual percentage of participants who are held out may not be equal to the percentage that you specify.

          TemplateName='string',
          Version='string'
      )
    :type TemplateName: string
    :param TemplateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the message template. A template name must start with an alphanumeric character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters. The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

      

    
    :type Version: string
    :param Version: 

      The unique identifier for the version of the message template to update, retrieve information about, or delete. To retrieve identifiers and other information for all the versions of a template, use the Template Versionsresource.

       

      If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. If specified for an update operation, this value must match the identifier for the latest existing version of the template. This restriction helps ensure that race conditions don't occur.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint does the following:

       

      
      * For a get operation, retrieves information about the active version of the template.
       
      * For an update operation, saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version parameter isn't used or is set to false.
       
      * For a delete operation, deletes the template, including all versions of the template.

                A map that defines 1-10 custom endpoint or user attributes, depending on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. Each of these attributes temporarily stores a recommended item that's retrieved from the recommender model and sent to an AWS Lambda function for additional processing. Each attribute can be used as a message variable in a message template.

                 

                This value is null if the configuration doesn't invoke an AWS Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform additional processing of recommendation data.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
            
          
              

              - **CreationDate** *(string) --* 

                The date, in extended ISO 8601 format, when the configuration was created for the recommender model.

                
              

              - **Description** *(string) --* 

                The custom description of the configuration for the recommender model.

                
              

              - **Id** *(string) --* 

                The unique identifier for the recommender model configuration.

                
              

              - **LastModifiedDate** *(string) --* 

                The date, in extended ISO 8601 format, when the configuration for the recommender model was last modified.

                
              

              - **Name** *(string) --* 

                The custom name of the configuration for the recommender model.

                
              

              - **RecommendationProviderIdType** *(string) --* 

                The type of Amazon Pinpoint ID that's associated with unique user IDs in the recommender model. This value enables the model to use attribute and event data that’s specific to a particular endpoint or user in an Amazon Pinpoint application. Possible values are:

                 

                
                * PINPOINT_ENDPOINT_ID - Each user in the model is associated with a particular endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is correlated based on endpoint IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. This is the default value.
                 
                * PINPOINT_USER_ID - Each user in the model is associated with a particular user and endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is correlated based on user IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. If this value is specified, an endpoint definition in Amazon Pinpoint has to specify both a user ID (UserId) and an endpoint ID. Otherwise, messages won’t be sent to the user's endpoint.
                

                
              

              - **RecommendationProviderRoleArn** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to retrieve recommendation data from the recommender model.

                
              

              - **RecommendationProviderUri** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recommender model that Amazon Pinpoint retrieves the recommendation data from. This value is the ARN of an Amazon Personalize campaign.

                
              

              - **RecommendationTransformerUri** *(string) --* 

                The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Lambda function that Amazon Pinpoint invokes to perform additional processing of recommendation data that it retrieves from the recommender model.

                
              

              - **RecommendationsDisplayName** *(string) --* 

                The custom display name for the standard endpoint or user attribute (RecommendationItems) that temporarily stores recommended items for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. This name appears in the **Attribute finder** of the template editor on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

                 

                This value is null if the configuration doesn't invoke an AWS Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform additional processing of recommendation data.

                
              

              - **RecommendationsPerMessage** *(integer) --* 

                The number of recommended items that are retrieved from the model for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. This number determines how many recommended items are available for use in message variables.

                
          
        
          

          - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

            The string to use in a subsequent request to get the next page of results in a paginated response. This value is null if there are no additional pages.

            * DIMENSIONAL - A dynamic segment, which is a segment that uses selection criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint data that's reported by your app. Dynamic segments can change over time.
             
            * IMPORT - A static segment, which is a segment that uses selection criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint definitions that you import from a file. Imported segments are static; they don't change over time.
            

            
          

          - **tags** *(dict) --*

      - *(dict) --* 

        The request succeeded.

        
        

        - **ImportJobsResponse** *(dict) --* 

          Provides information about the status and settings of all the import jobs that are associated with an application or segment. An import job is a job that imports endpoint definitions from one or more files.

          
          

          - **Item** *(list) --* 

            An array of responses, one for each import job that's associated with the application (Import Jobs resource) or segment (Segment Import Jobs resource).

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Provides information about the status and settings of a job that imports endpoint definitions from one or more files. The files can be stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or uploaded directly from a computer by using the Amazon Pinpoint console.

              
              

              - **ApplicationId** *(string) --* 

                The unique identifier for the application that's associated with the import job.

                
              

              - **CompletedPieces** *(integer) --* 

                The number of pieces that were processed successfully (completed) by the import job, as of the time of the request.

                
              

              - **CompletionDate** *(string) --* 

                The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the import job was completed.

                
              

              - **CreationDate** *(string) --* 

                The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the import job was created.

                
              

              - **Definition** *(dict) --* 

                The resource settings that apply to the import job.

                
                

                - **DefineSegment** *(boolean) --* 

                  Specifies whether the import job creates a segment that contains the endpoints, when the endpoint definitions are imported.

                  
                

                - **ExternalId** *(string) --* 

                  (Deprecated) Your AWS account ID, which you assigned to an external ID key in an IAM trust policy. Amazon Pinpoint previously used this value to assume an IAM role when importing endpoint definitions, but we removed this requirement. We don't recommend use of external IDs for IAM roles that are assumed by Amazon Pinpoint.

                  
                

                - **Format** *(string) --* 

                  The format of the files that contain the endpoint definitions to import. Valid values are: CSV, for comma-separated values format; and, JSON, for newline-delimited JSON format.

                   

                  If the files are stored in an Amazon S3 location and that location contains multiple files that use different formats, Amazon Pinpoint imports data only from the files that use the specified format.

                  
                

                - **RegisterEndpoints** *(boolean) --* 

                  Specifies whether the import job registers the endpoints with Amazon Pinpoint, when the endpoint definitions are imported.

                  
                

                - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to access the Amazon S3 location to import endpoint definitions from.

                  
                

                - **S3Url** *(string) --* 

                  The URL of the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that contains the endpoint definitions to import. This location can be a folder or a single file. If the location is a folder, Amazon Pinpoint imports endpoint definitions from the files in this location, including any subfolders that the folder contains.

                   

                  The URL should be in the following format: s3://bucket-name/folder-name/file-name. The location can end with the key for an individual object or a prefix that qualifies multiple objects.

                  
                

                - **SegmentId** *(string) --* 

                  The identifier for the segment that the import job updates or adds endpoint definitions to, if the import job updates an existing segment.

                  
                

                - **SegmentName** *(string) --* 

                  The custom name for the segment that's created by the import job, if the value of the DefineSegment property is true.

                  
            
              

              - **FailedPieces** *(integer) --* 

                The number of pieces that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the import job, as of the time of the request.

                
              

              - **Failures** *(list) --* 

                An array of entries, one for each of the first 100 entries that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the import job, if any.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **Id** *(string) --* 

                The unique identifier for the import job.

                
              

              - **JobStatus** *(string) --* 

                The status of the import job. The job status is FAILED if Amazon Pinpoint wasn't able to process one or more pieces in the job.

                
              

              - **TotalFailures** *(integer) --* 

                The total number of endpoint definitions that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the import job, typically because an error, such as a syntax error, occurred.

                
              

              - **TotalPieces** *(integer) --* 

                The total number of pieces that must be processed to complete the import job. Each piece consists of an approximately equal portion of the endpoint definitions that are part of the import job.

                
              

              - **TotalProcessed** *(integer) --* 

                The total number of endpoint definitions that were processed by the import job.

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.get_sms_template(
          TemplateName='string',
          Version='string'
      )
    :type TemplateName: string
    :param TemplateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the message template. A template name must start with an alphanumeric character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters. The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

      

    
    :type Version: string
    :param Version: 

      The unique identifier for the version of the message template to update, retrieve information about, or delete. To retrieve identifiers and other information for all the versions of a template, use the Template Versionsresource.

       

      If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. If specified for an update operation, this value must match the identifier for the latest existing version of the template. This restriction helps ensure that race conditions don't occur.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint does the following:

       

      
      * For a get operation, retrieves information about the active version of the template.
       
      * For an update operation, saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version parameter isn't used or is set to false.
       
      * For a delete operation, deletes the template, including all versions of the template.

                  One or more custom attributes that describe the user by associating a name with an array of values. For example, the value of an attribute named Interests might be: ["Science", "Music", "Travel"]. You can use these attributes as filter criteria when you create segments. Attribute names are case sensitive.

                   

                  An attribute name can contain up to 50 characters. An attribute value can contain up to 100 characters. When you define the name of a custom attribute, avoid using the following characters: number sign (#), colon (:), question mark (?), backslash (\), and slash (/). The Amazon Pinpoint console can't display attribute names that contain these characters. This restriction doesn't apply to attribute values.

    :type TemplateName: string
    :param TemplateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the message template. A template name must start with an alphanumeric character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters. The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

      

    
    :type Version: string
    :param Version: 

      The unique identifier for the version of the message template to update, retrieve information about, or delete. To retrieve identifiers and other information for all the versions of a template, use the Template Versionsresource.

       

      If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. If specified for an update operation, this value must match the identifier for the latest existing version of the template. This restriction helps ensure that race conditions don't occur.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint does the following:

       

      
      * For a get operation, retrieves information about the active version of the template.
       
      * For an update operation, saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version parameter isn't used or is set to false.
       
      * For a delete operation, deletes the template, including all versions of the template.

                            To determine which participants are sent down each path, Amazon Pinpoint applies a probability-based algorithm to the percentages that you specify for the paths. Therefore, the actual percentage of participants who are sent down a path may not be equal to the percentage that you specify.

            Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-collapse-id request header when it sends the notification message to APNs.

            

          
          - **Data** *(dict) --* 

            The JSON payload to use for a silent push notification. This payload is added to the data.pinpoint.jsonBody object of the notification.

            /listitem> 
            * 10 - High priority, the notification is sent immediately. This is the default value. A high priority notification should trigger an alert, play a sound, or badge your app's icon on the recipient's device.
            /para> 

            Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-priority request header when it sends the notification message to APNs.

             

            The equivalent values for Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), formerly Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), are normal, for 5, and high, for 10. If you specify an FCM value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint accepts and converts the value to the corresponding APNs value.

            

          
          - **RawContent** *(string) --* 

            The raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload for the notification message. If specified, this value overrides all other content for the message.

             

            .. note::

              

              If you specify the raw content of an APNs push notification, the message payload has to include the content-available key. The value of the content-available key has to be an integer, and can only be 0 or 1. If you're sending a standard notification, set the value of content-available to 0. If you're sending a silent (background) notification, set the value of content-available to 1. Additionally, silent notification payloads can't include the alert, badge, or sound keys. For more information, see `Generating a Remote Notification <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification>`__ and `Pushing Background Updates to Your App <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app>`__ on the Apple Developer website.

              

            

          
          - **SilentPush** *(boolean) --* 

            Specifies whether the notification is a silent push notification. A silent (or background) push notification isn't displayed on recipients' devices. You can use silent push notifications to make small updates to your app, or to display messages in an in-app message center.

             

            Amazon Pinpoint uses this property to determine the correct value for the apns-push-type request header when it sends the notification message to APNs. If you specify a value of true for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value for the apns-push-type header field to background.

             

            .. note::

              

              If you specify the raw content of an APNs push notification, the message payload has to include the content-available key. For silent (background) notifications, set the value of content-available to 1. Additionally, the message payload for a silent notification can't include the alert, badge, or sound keys. For more information, see `Generating a Remote Notification <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification>`__ and `Pushing Background Updates to Your App <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app>`__ on the Apple Developer website.

               

              Apple has indicated that they will throttle "excessive" background notifications based on current traffic volumes. To prevent your notifications being throttled, Apple recommends that you send no more than 3 silent push notifications to each recipient per hour.

            Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the FCM priority parameter when it sends the notification message to FCM.

             

            The equivalent values for Apple Push Notification service (APNs) are 5, for normal, and 10, for high. If you specify an APNs value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint accepts and converts the value to the corresponding FCM value.

            Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-push-type request header when it sends the notification message to APNs. If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value to alert or background automatically, based on the value that you specify for the SilentPush or RawContent property of the message.

             

            For more information about the apns-push-type request header, see `Sending Notification Requests to APNs <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/sending_notification_requests_to_apns>`__ on the Apple Developer website.

            The key that indicates whether and how to modify the badge of your app's icon when the recipient receives the push notification. If this key isn't included in the dictionary, the badge doesn't change. To remove the badge, set this value to 0.

            

          
          - **Body** *(string) --* 

            The body of the notification message.

          - **CollapseId** *(string) --* 

            An arbitrary identifier that, if assigned to multiple messages, APNs uses to coalesce the messages into a single push notification instead of delivering each message individually. This value can't exceed 64 bytes.

             

            Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-collapse-id request header when it sends the notification message to APNs.

            

          
          - **Data** *(dict) --* 

            The JSON payload to use for a silent push notification. This payload is added to the data.pinpoint.jsonBody object of the notification.

            para>5 - Low priority, the notification might be delayed, delivered as part of a group, or throttled.

            /listitem> 
            * 10 - High priority, the notification is sent immediately. This is the default value. A high priority notification should trigger an alert, play a sound, or badge your app's icon on the recipient's device.
            /para> 

            Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-priority request header when it sends the notification message to APNs.

             

            The equivalent values for Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), formerly Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), are normal, for 5, and high, for 10. If you specify an FCM value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint accepts and converts the value to the corresponding APNs value.

            

          
          - **RawContent** *(string) --* 

            The raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload for the notification message. If specified, this value overrides all other content for the message.

             

            .. note::

              

              If you specify the raw content of an APNs push notification, the message payload has to include the content-available key. The value of the content-available key has to be an integer, and can only be 0 or 1. If you're sending a standard notification, set the value of content-available to 0. If you're sending a silent (background) notification, set the value of content-available to 1. Additionally, silent notification payloads can't include the alert, badge, or sound keys. For more information, see `Generating a Remote Notification <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification>`__ and `Pushing Background Updates to Your App <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app>`__ on the Apple Developer website.

              

            

          
          - **SilentPush** *(boolean) --* 

            Specifies whether the notification is a silent push notification. A silent (or background) push notification isn't displayed on recipients' devices. You can use silent push notifications to make small updates to your app, or to display messages in an in-app message center.

             

            Amazon Pinpoint uses this property to determine the correct value for the apns-push-type request header when it sends the notification message to APNs. If you specify a value of true for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value for the apns-push-type header field to background.

             

            .. note::

              

              If you specify the raw content of an APNs push notification, the message payload has to include the content-available key. For silent (background) notifications, set the value of content-available to 1. Additionally, the message payload for a silent notification can't include the alert, badge, or sound keys. For more information, see `Generating a Remote Notification <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification>`__ and `Pushing Background Updates to Your App <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app>`__ on the Apple Developer website.

               

              Apple has indicated that they will throttle "excessive" background notifications based on current traffic volumes. To prevent your notifications being throttled, Apple recommends that you send no more than 3 silent push notifications to each recipient per hour.

              

            

          
          - **Sound** *(string) --*

The value for this key is the name of a sound file in your app's main bundle or the Library/Sounds folder in your app's data container. If the sound file can't be found or you specify default for the value, the system plays the default alert sound.

            

          
          - **Substitutions** *(dict) --*

          - **ThreadId** *(string) --* 

            The key that represents your app-specific identifier for grouping notifications. If you provide a Notification Content app extension, you can use this value to group your notifications together.

            

          
          - **TimeToLive** *(integer) --* 

            The amount of time, in seconds, that APNs should store and attempt to deliver the push notification, if the service is unable to deliver the notification the first time. If this value is 0, APNs treats the notification as if it expires immediately and the service doesn't store or try to deliver the notification again.

             

            Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-expiration request header when it sends the notification message to APNs.

          - **Action** *(string) --* 

            The action to occur if the recipient taps the push notification. Valid values are:

             

            
            * OPEN_APP - Your app opens or it becomes the foreground app if it was sent to the background. This is the default action.
             
            * DEEP_LINK - Your app opens and displays a designated user interface in the app. This action uses the deep-linking features of the Android platform.

          - **CollapseKey** *(string) --* 

            An arbitrary string that identifies a group of messages that can be collapsed to ensure that only the last message is sent when delivery can resume. This helps avoid sending too many instances of the same messages when the recipient's device comes online again or becomes active.

             

            Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) collapse_key parameter when it sends the notification message to FCM.

            

          
          - **Data** *(dict) --* 

            The JSON data payload to use for the push notification, if the notification is a silent push notification. This payload is added to the data.pinpoint.jsonBody object of the notification.

            

          
            - *(string) --*

            para>normal - The notification might be delayed. Delivery is optimized for battery usage on the recipient's device. Use this value unless immediate delivery is required.

            /listitem> 
            * high - The notification is sent immediately and might wake a sleeping device.
            /para> 

            Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the FCM priority parameter when it sends the notification message to FCM.

             

            The equivalent values for Apple Push Notification service (APNs) are 5, for normal, and 10, for high. If you specify an APNs value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint accepts and converts the value to the corresponding FCM value.

            

          
          - **RawContent** *(string) --* 

            The raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload for the notification message. If specified, this value overrides all other content for the message.

            The package name of the application where registration tokens must match in order for the recipient to receive the message.

            

          
          - **SilentPush** *(boolean) --* 

            Specifies whether the notification is a silent push notification, which is a push notification that doesn't display on a recipient's device. Silent push notifications can be used for cases such as updating an app's configuration or supporting phone home functionality.

            

          
          - **SmallImageIconUrl** *(string) --*

          - **Sound** *(string) --* 

            The sound to play when the recipient receives the push notification. You can use the default stream or specify the file name of a sound resource that's bundled in your app. On an Android platform, the sound file must reside in /res/raw/.

            

          
          - **Substitutions** *(dict) --* 

            The default message variables to use in the notification message. You can override the default variables with individual address variables.

            The amount of time, in seconds, that FCM should store and attempt to deliver the push notification, if the service is unable to deliver the notification the first time. If you don't specify this value, FCM defaults to the maximum value, which is 2,419,200 seconds (28 days).

             

            Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the FCM time_to_live parameter when it sends the notification message to FCM.

            

          
          - **Title** *(string) --*

To retrieve a list of versions and version identifiers for a template, use the Template Versionsresource.

             

            If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint uses the *active version* of the template. The *active version* is typically the version of a template that's been most recently reviewed and approved for use, depending on your workflow. It isn't necessarily the latest version of a template.

      Specifies whether to save the updates as a new version of the message template. Valid values are: true, save the updates as a new version; and, false, save the updates to (overwrite) the latest existing version of the template.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template. If you specify a value of true for this parameter, don't specify a value for the version parameter. Otherwise, an error will occur.

      

    
    :type EmailTemplateRequest: dict
    :param EmailTemplateRequest: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the content and settings for a message template that can be used in messages that are sent through the email channel.

      

    
      - **DefaultSubstitutions** *(string) --* 

        A JSON object that specifies the default values to use for message variables in the message template. This object is a set of key-value pairs. Each key defines a message variable in the template. The corresponding value defines the default value for that variable. When you create a message that's based on the template, you can override these defaults with message-specific and address-specific variables and values.

        

      
      - **HtmlPart** *(string) --* 

        The message body, in HTML format, to use in email messages that are based on the message template. We recommend using HTML format for email clients that render HTML content. You can include links, formatted text, and more in an HTML message.

        

      
      - **RecommenderId** *(string) --* 

        The unique identifier for the recommender model to use for the message template. Amazon Pinpoint uses this value to determine how to retrieve and process data from a recommender model when it sends messages that use the template, if the template contains message variables for recommendation data.

        

      
      - **Subject** *(string) --* 

        The subject line, or title, to use in email messages that are based on the message template.

        

      
      - **tags** *(dict) --* 

        A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that defines the tags to associate with the message template. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
          - *(string) --*

        A custom description of the message template.

        

      
      - **TextPart** *(string) --* 

        The message body, in plain text format, to use in email messages that are based on the message template. We recommend using plain text format for email clients that don't render HTML content and clients that are connected to high-latency networks, such as mobile devices.

        

      
    
    :type TemplateName: string
    :param TemplateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the message template. A template name must start with an alphanumeric character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters. The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

      

    
    :type Version: string
    :param Version: 

      The unique identifier for the version of the message template to update, retrieve information about, or delete. To retrieve identifiers and other information for all the versions of a template, use the Template Versionsresource.

       

      If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. If specified for an update operation, this value must match the identifier for the latest existing version of the template. This restriction helps ensure that race conditions don't occur.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint does the following:

       

      
      * For a get operation, retrieves information about the active version of the template.
       
      * For an update operation, saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version parameter isn't used or is set to false.
       
      * For a delete operation, deletes the template, including all versions of the template.

  .. py:method:: update_endpoints_batch(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new batch of endpoints for an application or updates the settings and attributes of a batch of existing endpoints for an application. You can also use this operation to define custom attributes for a batch of endpoints. If an update includes one or more values for a custom attribute, Amazon Pinpoint replaces (overwrites) any existing values with the new values.

                    * The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Lambda function to invoke to handle delivery of the campaign or treatment.
                     
                    * The URL for a web application or service that supports HTTPS and can receive the message. The URL has to be a full URL, including the HTTPS protocol.
                    

                    
                  

                  - **EndpointTypes** *(list) --* 

                    The types of endpoints to send the custom message to. Each valid value maps to a type of channel that you can associate with an endpoint by using the ChannelType property of an endpoint.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --*

                    If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint uses the *active version* of the template. The *active version* is typically the version of a template that's been most recently reviewed and approved for use, depending on your workflow. It isn't necessarily the latest version of a template.

                    
              
                

                - **ConditionalSplit** *(dict) --*

          }
      )
    :type ApplicationId: string
    :param ApplicationId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The unique identifier for the application. This identifier is displayed as the **Project ID** on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

      

    
    :type JourneyId: string
    :param JourneyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The unique identifier for the journey.

      

    
    :type JourneyStateRequest: dict
    :param JourneyStateRequest: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Changes the status of a journey.

      

    
      - **State** *(string) --* 

        The status of the journey. Currently, Supported values are ACTIVE, PAUSED, and CANCELLED

         

        If you cancel a journey, Amazon Pinpoint continues to perform activities that are currently in progress, until those activities are complete. Amazon Pinpoint also continues to collect and aggregate analytics data for those activities, until they are complete, and any activities that were complete when you cancelled the journey.

         

        After you cancel a journey, you can't add, change, or remove any activities from the journey. In addition, Amazon Pinpoint stops evaluating the journey and doesn't perform any activities that haven't started.

         

        When the journey is paused, Amazon Pinpoint continues to perform activities that are currently in progress, until those activities are complete. Endpoints will stop entering journeys when the journey is paused and will resume entering the journey after the journey is resumed. For wait activities, wait time is paused when the journey is paused. Currently, PAUSED only supports journeys with a segment refresh interval.

      )
    :type RecommenderId: string
    :param RecommenderId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The unique identifier for the recommender model configuration. This identifier is displayed as the **Recommender ID** on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

      

    
    :type UpdateRecommenderConfiguration: dict
    :param UpdateRecommenderConfiguration: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies Amazon Pinpoint configuration settings for retrieving and processing recommendation data from a recommender model.

      

    
      - **Attributes** *(dict) --* 

        A map of key-value pairs that defines 1-10 custom endpoint or user attributes, depending on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. Each of these attributes temporarily stores a recommended item that's retrieved from the recommender model and sent to an AWS Lambda function for additional processing. Each attribute can be used as a message variable in a message template.

         

        In the map, the key is the name of a custom attribute and the value is a custom display name for that attribute. The display name appears in the **Attribute finder** of the template editor on the Amazon Pinpoint console. The following restrictions apply to these names:

         

        
        * An attribute name must start with a letter or number and it can contain up to 50 characters. The characters can be letters, numbers, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Attribute names are case sensitive and must be unique.
         
        * An attribute display name must start with a letter or number and it can contain up to 25 characters. The characters can be letters, numbers, spaces, underscores (_), or hyphens (-).
        

         

        This object is required if the configuration invokes an AWS Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to process recommendation data. Otherwise, don't include this object in your request.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
    
  
      - **Description** *(string) --* 

        A custom description of the configuration for the recommender model. The description can contain up to 128 characters. The characters can be letters, numbers, spaces, or the following symbols: _ ; () , ‐.

        

      
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        A custom name of the configuration for the recommender model. The name must start with a letter or number and it can contain up to 128 characters. The characters can be letters, numbers, spaces, underscores (_), or hyphens (-).

        

      
      - **RecommendationProviderIdType** *(string) --* 

        The type of Amazon Pinpoint ID to associate with unique user IDs in the recommender model. This value enables the model to use attribute and event data that’s specific to a particular endpoint or user in an Amazon Pinpoint application. Valid values are:

         

        
        * PINPOINT_ENDPOINT_ID - Associate each user in the model with a particular endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is correlated based on endpoint IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. This is the default value.
         
        * PINPOINT_USER_ID - Associate each user in the model with a particular user and endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is correlated based on user IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. If you specify this value, an endpoint definition in Amazon Pinpoint has to specify both a user ID (UserId) and an endpoint ID. Otherwise, messages won’t be sent to the user's endpoint.
        

        

      
      - **RecommendationProviderRoleArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to retrieve recommendation data from the recommender model.

        

      
      - **RecommendationProviderUri** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recommender model to retrieve recommendation data from. This value must match the ARN of an Amazon Personalize campaign.

        

      
      - **RecommendationTransformerUri** *(string) --* 

        The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Lambda function to invoke for additional processing of recommendation data that's retrieved from the recommender model.

        

      
      - **RecommendationsDisplayName** *(string) --* 

        A custom display name for the standard endpoint or user attribute (RecommendationItems) that temporarily stores recommended items for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. This value is required if the configuration doesn't invoke an AWS Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform additional processing of recommendation data.

         

        This name appears in the **Attribute finder** of the template editor on the Amazon Pinpoint console. The name can contain up to 25 characters. The characters can be letters, numbers, spaces, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). These restrictions don't apply to attribute values.

        

      
      - **RecommendationsPerMessage** *(integer) --* 

        The number of recommended items to retrieve from the model for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. This number determines how many recommended items are available for use in message variables. The minimum value is 1. The maximum value is 5. The default value is 5.

         

        To use multiple recommended items and custom attributes with message variables, you have to use an AWS Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform additional processing of recommendation data.

                      Specifies attribute-based criteria for including or excluding endpoints from a segment.

                      

                    
                      - **AttributeType** *(string) --* 

                        The type of segment dimension to use. Valid values are: 

                        
                        * INCLUSIVE - endpoints that have attributes matching the values are included in the segment.
                        
                        * EXCLUSIVE - endpoints that have attributes matching the values are excluded in the segment.
                        
                        * CONTAINS - endpoints that have attributes' substrings match the values are included in the segment.
                        
                        * BEFORE - endpoints with attributes read as ISO_INSTANT datetimes before the value are included in the segment.
                        
                        * AFTER - endpoints with attributes read as ISO_INSTANT datetimes after the value are included in the segment.
                        
                        * ON - endpoints with attributes read as ISO_INSTANT dates on the value are included in the segment. Time is ignored in this comparison.
                        
                        * BETWEEN - endpoints with attributes read as ISO_INSTANT datetimes between the values are included in the segment.
                        

                        

                        

                      
                      - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                        The criteria values to use for the segment dimension. Depending on the value of the AttributeType property, endpoints are included or excluded from the segment if their attribute values match the criteria values.

                        

                      
                        - *(string) --* 

                        
                    
                    
              
            
              
          
            - **SourceSegments** *(list) --* 

              The base segment to build the segment on. A base segment, also referred to as a *source segment* , defines the initial population of endpoints for a segment. When you add dimensions to a segment, Amazon Pinpoint filters the base segment by using the dimensions that you specify.

               

              You can specify more than one dimensional segment or only one imported segment. If you specify an imported segment, the Amazon Pinpoint console displays a segment size estimate that indicates the size of the imported segment without any filters applied to it.

              

            
              - *(dict) --* 

                Specifies the segment identifier and version of a segment.

                

              
                - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The unique identifier for the segment.

                  

                
                - **Version** *(integer) --* 

                  The version number of the segment.

                  

                
              
          
            - **SourceType** *(string) --* 

              Specifies how to handle multiple base segments for the segment. For example, if you specify three base segments for the segment, whether the resulting segment is based on all, any, or none of the base segments.

              

            
            - **Type** *(string) --* 

              Specifies how to handle multiple dimensions for the segment. For example, if you specify three dimensions for the segment, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the dimensions.

              

            
          
      
        - **Include** *(string) --* 

          Specifies how to handle multiple segment groups for the segment. For example, if the segment includes three segment groups, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the segment groups.

          

        
      
      - **tags** *(dict) --* 

        A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that defines the tags to associate with the segment. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.

        

      
        - *(string) --*

                  The base segment to build the segment on. A base segment, also referred to as a *source segment* , defines the initial population of endpoints for a segment. When you add dimensions to a segment, Amazon Pinpoint filters the base segment by using the dimensions that you specify.

                   

                  You can specify more than one dimensional segment or only one imported segment. If you specify an imported segment, the Amazon Pinpoint console displays a segment size estimate that indicates the size of the imported segment without any filters applied to it.

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --*

                - **SourceType** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies how to handle multiple base segments for the segment. For example, if you specify three base segments for the segment, whether the resulting segment is based on all, any, or none of the base segments.

                  
                

                - **Type** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies how to handle multiple dimensions for the segment. For example, if you specify three dimensions for the segment, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the dimensions.

                  
            
          
            

            - **Include** *(string) --* 

              Specifies how to handle multiple segment groups for the segment. For example, if the segment includes three segment groups, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the segment groups.

              
        
          

          - **SegmentType** *(string) --* 

            The segment type. Valid values are:

             

            
            * DIMENSIONAL - A dynamic segment, which is a segment that uses selection criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint data that's reported by your app. Dynamic segments can change over time.
             
            * IMPORT - A static segment, which is a segment that uses selection criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint definitions that you import from a file. Imported segments are static; they don't change over time.
            

            
          

          - **tags** *(dict) --* 

            A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that identifies the tags that are associated with the segment. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.

      )
    :type CreateNewVersion: boolean
    :param CreateNewVersion: 

      Specifies whether to save the updates as a new version of the message template. Valid values are: true, save the updates as a new version; and, false, save the updates to (overwrite) the latest existing version of the template.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template. If you specify a value of true for this parameter, don't specify a value for the version parameter. Otherwise, an error will occur.

      

    
    :type SMSTemplateRequest: dict
    :param SMSTemplateRequest: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the content and settings for a message template that can be used in text messages that are sent through the SMS channel.

      

    
      - **Body** *(string) --* 

        The message body to use in text messages that are based on the message template.

        

      
      - **DefaultSubstitutions** *(string) --* 

        A JSON object that specifies the default values to use for message variables in the message template. This object is a set of key-value pairs. Each key defines a message variable in the template. The corresponding value defines the default value for that variable. When you create a message that's based on the template, you can override these defaults with message-specific and address-specific variables and values.

        

      
      - **RecommenderId** *(string) --* 

        The unique identifier for the recommender model to use for the message template. Amazon Pinpoint uses this value to determine how to retrieve and process data from a recommender model when it sends messages that use the template, if the template contains message variables for recommendation data.

        

      
      - **tags** *(dict) --* 

        A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that defines the tags to associate with the message template. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.

        A custom description of the message template.

        

      
    
    :type TemplateName: string
    :param TemplateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the message template. A template name must start with an alphanumeric character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters. The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

      

    
    :type Version: string
    :param Version: 

      The unique identifier for the version of the message template to update, retrieve information about, or delete. To retrieve identifiers and other information for all the versions of a template, use the Template Versionsresource.

       

      If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. If specified for an update operation, this value must match the identifier for the latest existing version of the template. This restriction helps ensure that race conditions don't occur.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint does the following:

       

      
      * For a get operation, retrieves information about the active version of the template.
       
      * For an update operation, saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version parameter isn't used or is set to false.
       
      * For a delete operation, deletes the template, including all versions of the template.

    :param CreateNewVersion: 

      Specifies whether to save the updates as a new version of the message template. Valid values are: true, save the updates as a new version; and, false, save the updates to (overwrite) the latest existing version of the template.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template. If you specify a value of true for this parameter, don't specify a value for the version parameter. Otherwise, an error will occur.

      

    
    :type TemplateName: string
    :param TemplateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the message template. A template name must start with an alphanumeric character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters. The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

      

    
    :type Version: string
    :param Version: 

      The unique identifier for the version of the message template to update, retrieve information about, or delete. To retrieve identifiers and other information for all the versions of a template, use the Template Versionsresource.

       

      If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. If specified for an update operation, this value must match the identifier for the latest existing version of the template. This restriction helps ensure that race conditions don't occur.

       

      If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint does the following:

       

      
      * For a get operation, retrieves information about the active version of the template.
       
      * For an update operation, saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version parameter isn't used or is set to false.
       
      * For a delete operation, deletes the template, including all versions of the template.

      - **DefaultSubstitutions** *(string) --* 

        A JSON object that specifies the default values to use for message variables in the message template. This object is a set of key-value pairs. Each key defines a message variable in the template. The corresponding value defines the default value for that variable. When you create a message that's based on the template, you can override these defaults with message-specific and address-specific variables and values.

        

      
      - **LanguageCode** *(string) --* 

        The code for the language to use when synthesizing the text of the script in messages that are based on the message template. For a list of supported languages and the code for each one, see the `Amazon Polly Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/what-is.html>`__ .

        

      
      - **tags** *(dict) --* 

        A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that defines the tags to associate with the message template. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
          - *(string) --*
