.. py:class:: Snowball.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon Import/Export Snowball
  

  AWS Snow Family is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snow commands described here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snow Family Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for a Snow device. To transfer data locally with a Snow device, you'll need to use the Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or AWS OpsHub for Snow Family. For more information, see the `User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html>`__ .

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: cancel_cluster(**kwargs)

    

    Cancels a cluster job. You can only cancel a cluster job while it's in the ``AwaitingQuorum`` status. You'll have at least an hour after creating a cluster job to cancel it.

    

    See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/snowball-2016-06-30/CancelCluster>`_

  .. py:method:: create_job(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a job to import or export data between Amazon S3 and your on-premises data center. Your AWS account must have the right trust policies and permissions in place to create a job for a Snow device. If you're creating a job for a node in a cluster, you only need to provide the ``clusterId`` value; the other job attributes are inherited from the cluster. 

     

    .. note::

       

      Only the Snowball; Edge device type is supported when ordering clustered jobs.

       

      The device capacity is optional.

       

      Availability of device types differ by AWS Region. For more information about Region availability, see `AWS Regional Services <https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/?p=ngi&loc=4>`__ .

            * In Australia, you have access to express shipping. Typically, devices shipped express are delivered in about a day. 
             
            * In the European Union (EU), you have access to express shipping. Typically, Snow devices shipped express are delivered in about a day. In addition, most countries in the EU have access to standard shipping, which typically takes less than a week, one way. 
             
            * In India, Snow devices are delivered in one to seven days. 
             
            * In the US, you have access to one-day shipping and two-day shipping.

  .. py:method:: get_job_manifest(**kwargs)

    

    Returns a link to an Amazon S3 presigned URL for the manifest file associated with the specified ``JobId`` value. You can access the manifest file for up to 60 minutes after this request has been made. To access the manifest file after 60 minutes have passed, you'll have to make another call to the ``GetJobManifest`` action.

     

    The manifest is an encrypted file that you can download after your job enters the ``WithCustomer`` status. The manifest is decrypted by using the ``UnlockCode`` code value, when you pass both values to the Snow device through the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time.

     

    As a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of an ``UnlockCode`` value in the same location as the manifest file for that job. Saving these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the Snow device associated with that job.

     

    The credentials of a given job, including its manifest file and unlock code, expire 360 days after the job is created.

            - **JobId** *(string) --* 

              The automatically generated ID for a job, for example ``JID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000`` .

              The current state of this job.

              
            

            - **IsMaster** *(boolean) --* 

              A value that indicates that this job is a main job. A main job represents a successful request to create an export job. Main jobs aren't associated with any Snowballs. Instead, each main job will have at least one job part, and each job part is associated with a Snowball. It might take some time before the job parts associated with a particular main job are listed, because they are created after the main job is created.

              
            

            - **JobType** *(string) --* 

              The type of job.

              
            

            - **SnowballType** *(string) --* 

              The type of device used with this job.

              
            

            - **CreationDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The creation date for this job.

              
            

            - **Description** *(string) --* 

              The optional description of this specific job, for example ``Important Photos 2016-08-11`` .

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          HTTP requests are stateless. If you use the automatically generated ``NextToken`` value in your next ``ListClusterJobsResult`` call, your list of returned jobs will start from this point in the array.
