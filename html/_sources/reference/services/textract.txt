.. py:class:: Textract.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon Textract
  

  Amazon Textract detects and analyzes text in documents and converts it into machine-readable text. This is the API reference documentation for Amazon Textract.

  ::

    
    import boto3
    
    client = boto3.client('textract')

  
  These are the available methods:
  
  *   :py:meth:`~Textract.Client.analyze_document`

  
  *   :py:meth:`~Textract.Client.can_paginate`

  
  *   :py:meth:`~Textract.Client.detect_document_text`

  
  *   :py:meth:`~Textract.Client.generate_presigned_url`

  
  *   :py:meth:`~Textract.Client.get_document_analysis`

  
  *   :py:meth:`~Textract.Client.get_document_text_detection`

  .. py:method:: analyze_document(**kwargs)

    

    Analyzes an input document for relationships between detected items. 

     

    The types of information returned are as follows: 

     

     
    * Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned in two  Block objects, each of type ``KEY_VALUE_SET`` : a KEY ``Block`` object and a VALUE ``Block`` object. For example, *Name: Ana Silva Carolina* contains a key and value. *Name:* is the key. *Ana Silva Carolina* is the value. 
     
    * Table and table cell data. A TABLE ``Block`` object contains information about a detected table. A CELL ``Block`` object is returned for each cell in a table. 
     
    * Lines and words of text. A LINE ``Block`` object contains one or more WORD ``Block`` objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with the value of ``FeatureTypes`` ).  
     

     

    Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT ``Block`` object contains information about a selection element, including the selection status.

     

    You can choose which type of analysis to perform by specifying the ``FeatureTypes`` list. 

     

    The output is returned in a list of ``Block`` objects.

     

     ``AnalyzeDocument`` is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use  StartDocumentAnalysis .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **DocumentMetadata** *(dict) --* 

          Metadata about the analyzed document. An example is the number of pages.

          
          

          - **Pages** *(integer) --* 

            The number of pages that are detected in the document.

            
      
        

        - **Blocks** *(list) --* 

          The items that are detected and analyzed by ``AnalyzeDocument`` .

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A ``Block`` represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a ``Block`` object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example  DetectDocumentText ), you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you can also get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.

             

            An array of ``Block`` objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText , the array of ``Block`` objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as  GetDocumentAnalysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

                Information about how blocks are related to each other. A ``Block`` object contains 0 or more ``Relation`` objects in a list, ``Relationships`` . For more information, see  Block .

                 

                The ``Type`` element provides the type of the relationship for all blocks in the ``IDs`` array. 

                
                

                - **Type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of relationship that the blocks in the IDs array have with the current block. The relationship can be ``VALUE`` or ``CHILD`` . A relationship of type VALUE is a list that contains the ID of the VALUE block that's associated with the KEY of a key-value pair. A relationship of type CHILD is a list of IDs that identify WORD blocks in the case of lines Cell blocks in the case of Tables, and WORD blocks in the case of Selection Elements.

                  
                

                - **Ids** *(list) --* 

                  An array of IDs for related blocks. You can get the type of the relationship from the ``Type`` element.

              * *KEY* - An identifier for a field on the document. 
               
              * *VALUE* - The field text. 
               

               

               ``EntityTypes`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
            

            - **SelectionStatus** *(string) --* 

              The selection status of a selection element, such as an option button or check box. 

              
            

            - **Page** *(integer) --* 

              The page on which a block was detected. ``Page`` is returned by asynchronous operations. Page values greater than 1 are only returned for multipage documents that are in PDF format. A scanned image (JPEG/PNG), even if it contains multiple document pages, is considered to be a single-page document. The value of ``Page`` is always 1. Synchronous operations don't return ``Page`` because every input document is considered to be a single-page document.

              
        
      
        

        - **HumanLoopActivationOutput** *(dict) --*

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: detect_document_text(**kwargs)

    

    Detects text in the input document. Amazon Textract can detect lines of text and the words that make up a line of text. The input document must be an image in JPEG or PNG format. ``DetectDocumentText`` returns the detected text in an array of  Block objects. 

     

    Each document page has as an associated ``Block`` of type PAGE. Each PAGE ``Block`` object is the parent of LINE ``Block`` objects that represent the lines of detected text on a page. A LINE ``Block`` object is a parent for each word that makes up the line. Words are represented by ``Block`` objects of type WORD.

     

     ``DetectDocumentText`` is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use  StartDocumentTextDetection .

     

    For more information, see `Document Text Detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works-detecting.html>`__ .

        - **DocumentMetadata** *(dict) --* 

          Metadata about the document. It contains the number of pages that are detected in the document.

          
          

          - **Pages** *(integer) --* 

            The number of pages that are detected in the document.

            
      
        

        - **Blocks** *(list) --*

          - *(dict) --* 

            A ``Block`` represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a ``Block`` object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example  DetectDocumentText ), you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you can also get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.

             

            An array of ``Block`` objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText , the array of ``Block`` objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as  GetDocumentAnalysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

              The type of entity. The following can be returned:

               

               
              * *KEY* - An identifier for a field on the document. 
               
              * *VALUE* - The field text. 
               

               

               ``EntityTypes`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
            

            - **SelectionStatus** *(string) --* 

              The selection status of a selection element, such as an option button or check box. 

              
            

            - **Page** *(integer) --* 

              The page on which a block was detected. ``Page`` is returned by asynchronous operations. Page values greater than 1 are only returned for multipage documents that are in PDF format. A scanned image (JPEG/PNG), even if it contains multiple document pages, is considered to be a single-page document. The value of ``Page`` is always 1. Synchronous operations don't return ``Page`` because every input document is considered to be a single-page document.

  .. py:method:: get_document_analysis(**kwargs)

    

    Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that analyzes text in a document.

     

    You start asynchronous text analysis by calling  StartDocumentAnalysis , which returns a job identifier (``JobId`` ). When the text analysis operation finishes, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that's registered in the initial call to ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` . To get the results of the text-detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is ``SUCCEEDED`` . If so, call ``GetDocumentAnalysis`` , and pass the job identifier (``JobId`` ) from the initial call to ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` .

     

     ``GetDocumentAnalysis`` returns an array of  Block objects. The following types of information are returned: 

     

     
    * Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned in two  Block objects, each of type ``KEY_VALUE_SET`` : a KEY ``Block`` object and a VALUE ``Block`` object. For example, *Name: Ana Silva Carolina* contains a key and value. *Name:* is the key. *Ana Silva Carolina* is the value. 
     
    * Table and table cell data. A TABLE ``Block`` object contains information about a detected table. A CELL ``Block`` object is returned for each cell in a table. 
     
    * Lines and words of text. A LINE ``Block`` object contains one or more WORD ``Block`` objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with the value of the ``StartDocumentAnalysis``  ``FeatureTypes`` input parameter).  
     

     

    Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT ``Block`` object contains information about a selection element, including the selection status.

     

    Use the ``MaxResults`` parameter to limit the number of blocks that are returned. If there are more results than specified in ``MaxResults`` , the value of ``NextToken`` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call ``GetDocumentAnalysis`` , and populate the ``NextToken`` request parameter with the token value that's returned from the previous call to ``GetDocumentAnalysis`` .

    :param JobId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A unique identifier for the text-detection job. The ``JobId`` is returned from ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` . A ``JobId`` value is only valid for 7 days.

      

    
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      The maximum number of results to return per paginated call. The largest value that you can specify is 1,000. If you specify a value greater than 1,000, a maximum of 1,000 results is returned. The default value is 1,000.

      

    
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      If the previous response was incomplete (because there are more blocks to retrieve), Amazon Textract returns a pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set of blocks.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **DocumentMetadata** *(dict) --* 

          Information about a document that Amazon Textract processed. ``DocumentMetadata`` is returned in every page of paginated responses from an Amazon Textract video operation.

          
          

          - **Pages** *(integer) --* 

            The number of pages that are detected in the document.

            
      
        

        - **JobStatus** *(string) --* 

          The current status of the text detection job.

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          If the response is truncated, Amazon Textract returns this token. You can use this token in the subsequent request to retrieve the next set of text detection results.

          
        

        - **Blocks** *(list) --* 

          The results of the text-analysis operation.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A ``Block`` represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a ``Block`` object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example  DetectDocumentText ), you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you can also get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.

             

            An array of ``Block`` objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText , the array of ``Block`` objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as  GetDocumentAnalysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

            - **Relationships** *(list) --* 

              A list of child blocks of the current block. For example, a LINE object has child blocks for each WORD block that's part of the line of text. There aren't Relationship objects in the list for relationships that don't exist, such as when the current block has no child blocks. The list size can be the following:

               

               
              * 0 - The block has no child blocks. 
               
              * 1 - The block has child blocks.

                Information about how blocks are related to each other. A ``Block`` object contains 0 or more ``Relation`` objects in a list, ``Relationships`` . For more information, see  Block .

                 

                The ``Type`` element provides the type of the relationship for all blocks in the ``IDs`` array. 

                
                

                - **Type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of relationship that the blocks in the IDs array have with the current block. The relationship can be ``VALUE`` or ``CHILD`` . A relationship of type VALUE is a list that contains the ID of the VALUE block that's associated with the KEY of a key-value pair. A relationship of type CHILD is a list of IDs that identify WORD blocks in the case of lines Cell blocks in the case of Tables, and WORD blocks in the case of Selection Elements.

                  
                

                - **Ids** *(list) --* 

                  An array of IDs for related blocks. You can get the type of the relationship from the ``Type`` element.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
            
          
            

            - **EntityTypes** *(list) --* 

              The type of entity. The following can be returned:

               

               
              * *KEY* - An identifier for a field on the document. 
               
              * *VALUE* - The field text. 
               

               

               ``EntityTypes`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

              
              

              - *(string) --*

              The page on which a block was detected. ``Page`` is returned by asynchronous operations. Page values greater than 1 are only returned for multipage documents that are in PDF format. A scanned image (JPEG/PNG), even if it contains multiple document pages, is considered to be a single-page document. The value of ``Page`` is always 1. Synchronous operations don't return ``Page`` because every input document is considered to be a single-page document.

              
        
      
        

        - **Warnings** *(list) --*

  .. py:method:: get_document_text_detection(**kwargs)

    

    Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that detects text in a document. Amazon Textract can detect lines of text and the words that make up a line of text.

     

    You start asynchronous text detection by calling  StartDocumentTextDetection , which returns a job identifier (``JobId`` ). When the text detection operation finishes, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that's registered in the initial call to ``StartDocumentTextDetection`` . To get the results of the text-detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is ``SUCCEEDED`` . If so, call ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` , and pass the job identifier (``JobId`` ) from the initial call to ``StartDocumentTextDetection`` .

     

     ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` returns an array of  Block objects. 

     

    Each document page has as an associated ``Block`` of type PAGE. Each PAGE ``Block`` object is the parent of LINE ``Block`` objects that represent the lines of detected text on a page. A LINE ``Block`` object is a parent for each word that makes up the line. Words are represented by ``Block`` objects of type WORD.

     

    Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of blocks that are returned. If there are more results than specified in ``MaxResults`` , the value of ``NextToken`` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` , and populate the ``NextToken`` request parameter with the token value that's returned from the previous call to ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **DocumentMetadata** *(dict) --* 

          Information about a document that Amazon Textract processed. ``DocumentMetadata`` is returned in every page of paginated responses from an Amazon Textract video operation.

          
          

          - **Pages** *(integer) --* 

            The number of pages that are detected in the document.

            
      
        

        - **JobStatus** *(string) --* 

          The current status of the text detection job.

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          If the response is truncated, Amazon Textract returns this token. You can use this token in the subsequent request to retrieve the next set of text-detection results.

          
        

        - **Blocks** *(list) --* 

          The results of the text-detection operation.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A ``Block`` represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a ``Block`` object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example  DetectDocumentText ), you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you can also get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.

             

            An array of ``Block`` objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText , the array of ``Block`` objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as  GetDocumentAnalysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

There aren't Relationship objects in the list for relationships that don't exist, such as when the current block has no child blocks. The list size can be the following:

               

               
              * 0 - The block has no child blocks.

                - **Type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of relationship that the blocks in the IDs array have with the current block. The relationship can be ``VALUE`` or ``CHILD`` . A relationship of type VALUE is a list that contains the ID of the VALUE block that's associated with the KEY of a key-value pair. A relationship of type CHILD is a list of IDs that identify WORD blocks in the case of lines Cell blocks in the case of Tables, and WORD blocks in the case of Selection Elements.

                  
                

                - **Ids** *(list) --* 

                  An array of IDs for related blocks. You can get the type of the relationship from the ``Type`` element.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
            
          
            

            - **EntityTypes** *(list) --* 

              The type of entity. The following can be returned:

               

               
              * *KEY* - An identifier for a field on the document. 
               
              * *VALUE* - The field text. 
               

               

               ``EntityTypes`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
            

            - **SelectionStatus** *(string) --* 

              The selection status of a selection element, such as an option button or check box. 

              
            

            - **Page** *(integer) --* 

              The page on which a block was detected. ``Page`` is returned by asynchronous operations. Page values greater than 1 are only returned for multipage documents that are in PDF format. A scanned image (JPEG/PNG), even if it contains multiple document pages, is considered to be a single-page document. The value of ``Page`` is always 1. Synchronous operations don't return ``Page`` because every input document is considered to be a single-page document.

              
        
      
        

        - **Warnings** *(list) --* 

          A list of warnings that occurred during the text-detection operation for the document.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A warning about an issue that occurred during asynchronous text analysis ( StartDocumentAnalysis ) or asynchronous document text detection ( StartDocumentTextDetection ). 

            
            

            - **ErrorCode** *(string) --* 

              The error code for the warning.

              
            

            - **Pages** *(list) --* 

              A list of the pages that the warning applies to.

              
              

              - *(integer) --* 
          
        
      
        

        - **StatusMessage** *(string) --* 

          Returns if the detection job could not be completed. Contains explanation for what error occured. 

          
        

        - **DetectDocumentTextModelVersion** *(string) --*

  .. py:method:: get_paginator(operation_name)

        
    Create a paginator for an operation.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :raise OperationNotPageableError: Raised if the operation is not
        pageable.  You can use the ``client.can_paginate`` method to
        check if an operation is pageable.
    
    :rtype: L{botocore.paginate.Paginator}
    :return: A paginator object.


  .. py:method:: get_waiter(waiter_name)

        
    Returns an object that can wait for some condition.
    
    :type waiter_name: str
    :param waiter_name: The name of the waiter to get. See the waiters
        section of the service docs for a list of available waiters.
    
    :returns: The specified waiter object.
    :rtype: botocore.waiter.Waiter


  .. py:method:: start_document_analysis(**kwargs)

    

    Starts the asynchronous analysis of an input document for relationships between detected items such as key-value pairs, tables, and selection elements.

     

     ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` can analyze text in documents that are in JPEG, PNG, and PDF format. The documents are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use  DocumentLocation to specify the bucket name and file name of the document. 

     

     ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` returns a job identifier (``JobId`` ) that you use to get the results of the operation. When text analysis is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you specify in ``NotificationChannel`` . To get the results of the text analysis operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is ``SUCCEEDED`` . If so, call  GetDocumentAnalysis , and pass the job identifier (``JobId`` ) from the initial call to ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` .

     

    For more information, see `Document Text Analysis <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works-analyzing.html>`__ .
