  .. py:method:: batch_create_table_rows(**kwargs)

    

    The BatchCreateTableRows API allows you to create one or more rows at the end of a table in a workbook. The API allows you to specify the values to set in some or all of the columns in the new rows. 

     

    If a column is not explicitly set in a specific row, then the column level formula specified in the table will be applied to the new row. If there is no column level formula but the last row of the table has a formula, then that formula will be copied down to the new row. If there is no column level formula and no formula in the last row of the table, then that column will be left blank for the new rows.

      )
    :type workbookId: string
    :param workbookId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ID of the workbook where the new rows are being added.

       

      If a workbook with the specified ID could not be found, this API throws ResourceNotFoundException. 

      

    
    :type tableId: string
    :param tableId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ID of the table where the new rows are being added.

       

      If a table with the specified ID could not be found, this API throws ResourceNotFoundException. 

      

    
    :type rowsToCreate: list
    :param rowsToCreate: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The list of rows to create at the end of the table. Each item in this list needs to have a batch item id to uniquely identify the element in the request and the cells to create for that row. You need to specify at least one item in this list. 

       

      Note that if one of the column ids in any of the rows in the request does not exist in the table, then the request fails and no updates are made to the table. 

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Data needed to create a single row in a table as part of the BatchCreateTableRows request. 

        

      
        - **batchItemId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An external identifier that represents the single row that is being created as part of the BatchCreateTableRows request. This can be any string that you can use to identify the row in the request. The BatchCreateTableRows API puts the batch item id in the results to allow you to link data in the request to data in the results. 

          

        
        - **cellsToCreate** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A map representing the cells to create in the new row. The key is the column id of the cell and the value is the CellInput object that represents the data to set in that cell. 

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
            - *(dict) --* 

              CellInput object contains the data needed to create or update cells in a table. 

              

            
              - **fact** *(string) --* 

                Fact represents the data that is entered into a cell. This data can be free text or a formula. Formulas need to start with the equals (=) sign. 

                

              
            
      
    
      
  
    :type clientRequestToken: string
    :param clientRequestToken: 

      The request token for performing the batch create operation. Request tokens help to identify duplicate requests. If a call times out or fails due to a transient error like a failed network connection, you can retry the call with the same request token. The service ensures that if the first call using that request token is successfully performed, the second call will not perform the operation again. 

       

      Note that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You cannot use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

  .. py:method:: batch_upsert_table_rows(**kwargs)

    

    The BatchUpsertTableRows API allows you to upsert one or more rows in a table. The upsert operation takes a filter expression as input and evaluates it to find matching rows on the destination table. If matching rows are found, it will update the cells in the matching rows to new values specified in the request. If no matching rows are found, a new row is added at the end of the table and the cells in that row are set to the new values specified in the request. 

     

    You can specify the values to set in some or all of the columns in the table for the matching or newly appended rows. If a column is not explicitly specified for a particular row, then that column will not be updated for that row. To clear out the data in a specific cell, you need to set the value as an empty string ("").

      The ID of the workbook where the rows are being upserted.

       

      If a workbook with the specified id could not be found, this API throws ResourceNotFoundException. 

      

    
    :type tableId: string
    :param tableId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ID of the table where the rows are being upserted.

       

      If a table with the specified id could not be found, this API throws ResourceNotFoundException. 

      

    
    :type rowsToUpsert: list
    :param rowsToUpsert: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The list of rows to upsert in the table. Each item in this list needs to have a batch item id to uniquely identify the element in the request, a filter expression to find the rows to update for that element and the cell values to set for each column in the upserted rows. You need to specify at least one item in this list. 

       

      Note that if one of the filter formulas in the request fails to evaluate because of an error or one of the column ids in any of the rows does not exist in the table, then the request fails and no updates are made to the table. 

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Data needed to upsert rows in a table as part of a single item in the BatchUpsertTableRows request. 

        

      
        - **batchItemId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An external identifier that represents a single item in the request that is being upserted as part of the BatchUpsertTableRows request. This can be any string that you can use to identify the item in the request. The BatchUpsertTableRows API puts the batch item id in the results to allow you to link data in the request to data in the results. 

          

        
        - **filter** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The filter formula to use to find existing matching rows to update. The formula needs to return zero or more rows. If the formula returns 0 rows, then a new row will be appended in the target table. If the formula returns one or more rows, then the returned rows will be updated. 

           

          Note that the filter formula needs to return rows from the target table for the upsert operation to succeed. If the filter formula has a syntax error or it doesn't evaluate to zero or more rows in the target table for any one item in the input list, then the entire BatchUpsertTableRows request fails and no updates are made to the table. 

          

        
          - **formula** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            A formula representing a filter function that returns zero or more matching rows from a table. Valid formulas in this field return a list of rows from a table. The most common ways of writing a formula to return a list of rows are to use the FindRow() or Filter() functions. Any other formula that returns zero or more rows is also acceptable. For example, you can use a formula that points to a cell that contains a filter function. 

            

          
          - **contextRowId** *(string) --* 

            The optional contextRowId attribute can be used to specify the row id of the context row if the filter formula contains unqualified references to table columns and needs a context row to evaluate them successfully. 

            

          
        
        - **cellsToUpdate** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A map representing the cells to update for the matching rows or an appended row. The key is the column id of the cell and the value is the CellInput object that represents the data to set in that cell. 

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
            - *(dict) --* 

              CellInput object contains the data needed to create or update cells in a table. 

              

            
              - **fact** *(string) --* 

                Fact represents the data that is entered into a cell. This data can be free text or a formula. Formulas need to start with the equals (=) sign. 

                

              
            
      
    
      
  
    :type clientRequestToken: string
    :param clientRequestToken: 

      The request token for performing the update action. Request tokens help to identify duplicate requests. If a call times out or fails due to a transient error like a failed network connection, you can retry the call with the same request token. The service ensures that if the first call using that request token is successfully performed, the second call will not perform the action again. 

       

      Note that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You cannot use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **results** *(dict) --* 

          A map of all the rows on the screen keyed by block name.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              ResultSet contains the results of the request for a single block or list defined on the screen. 

              
              

              - **headers** *(list) --* 

                List of headers for all the data cells in the block. The header identifies the name and default format of the data cell. Data cells appear in the same order in all rows as defined in the header. The names and formats are not repeated in the rows. If a particular row does not have a value for a data cell, a blank value is used. 

                 

                For example, a task list that displays the task name, due date and assigned person might have headers [ { "name": "Task Name"}, {"name": "Due Date", "format": "DATE"}, {"name": "Assigned", "format": "CONTACT"} ]. Every row in the result will have the task name as the first item, due date as the second item and assigned person as the third item. If a particular task does not have a due date, that row will still have a blank value in the second element and the assigned person will still be in the third element. 

                
                

                - *(dict) --*

                  - **format** *(string) --* 

                    The format of the column.

                    
              
            
              

              - **rows** *(list) --* 

                List of rows returned by the request. Each row has a row Id and a list of data cells in that row. The data cells will be present in the same order as they are defined in the header. 

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A single row in the ResultSet.

                  
                  

                  - **rowId** *(string) --*

                  - **dataItems** *(list) --* 

                    List of all the data cells in a row.

                    
                    

                    - *(dict) --* 

                      The data in a particular data cell defined on the screen.

                      
                      

                      - **overrideFormat** *(string) --* 

                        The overrideFormat is optional and is specified only if a particular row of data has a different format for the data than the default format defined on the screen or the table. 

                        
                      

                      - **rawValue** *(string) --*

        - **workbookCursor** *(integer) --* 

          Indicates the cursor of the workbook at which the data returned by this workbook is read. Workbook cursor keeps increasing with every update and the increments are not sequential. 

          
        

        - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

          Provides the pagination token to load the next page if there are more results matching the request. If a pagination token is not present in the response, it means that all data matching the query has been loaded.

  .. py:method:: invoke_screen_automation(**kwargs)

    

    The InvokeScreenAutomation API allows invoking an action defined in a screen in a Honeycode app. The API allows setting local variables, which can then be used in the automation being invoked. This allows automating the Honeycode app interactions to write, update or delete data in the workbook.

      Variables are specified as a map where the key is the name of the variable as defined on the screen. The value is an object which currently has only one property, rawValue, which holds the value of the variable to be passed to the screen. Any variables defined in a screen are required to be passed in the call. 

      

    
      - *(string) --*

      The row ID for the automation if the automation is defined inside a block with source or list. 

      

    
    :type clientRequestToken: string
    :param clientRequestToken: 

      The request token for performing the automation action. Request tokens help to identify duplicate requests. If a call times out or fails due to a transient error like a failed network connection, you can retry the call with the same request token. The service ensures that if the first call using that request token is successfully performed, the second call will return the response of the previous call rather than performing the action again. 

       

      Note that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You cannot use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

            An object that contains attributes about a single row in a table

            
            

            - **rowId** *(string) --* 

              The id of the row in the table.

              
            

            - **cells** *(list) --* 

              A list of cells in the table row. The cells appear in the same order as the columns of the table. 

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                An object that represents a single cell in a table.

                
                

                - **formula** *(string) --* 

                  The formula contained in the cell. This field is empty if a cell does not have a formula. 

                  
                

                - **format** *(string) --* 

                  The format of the cell. If this field is empty, then the format is either not specified in the workbook or the format is set to AUTO.

                  
                

                - **rawValue** *(string) --* 

                  The raw value of the data contained in the cell. The raw value depends on the format of the data in the cell. However the attribute in the API return value is always a string containing the raw value. 

                   

                  Cells with format DATE, DATE_TIME or TIME have the raw value as a floating point number where the whole number represents the number of days since 1/1/1900 and the fractional part represents the fraction of the day since midnight. For example, a cell with date 11/3/2020 has the raw value "44138". A cell with the time 9:00 AM has the raw value "0.375" and a cell with date/time value of 11/3/2020 9:00 AM has the raw value "44138.375". Notice that even though the raw value is a number in all three cases, it is still represented as a string. 

                   

                  Cells with format NUMBER, CURRENCY, PERCENTAGE and ACCOUNTING have the raw value of the data as the number representing the data being displayed. For example, the number 1.325 with two decimal places in the format will have it's raw value as "1.325" and formatted value as "1.33". A currency value for $10 will have the raw value as "10" and formatted value as "$10.00". A value representing 20% with two decimal places in the format will have its raw value as "0.2" and the formatted value as "20.00%". An accounting value of -$25 will have "-25" as the raw value and "$ (25.00)" as the formatted value. 

                   

                  Cells with format TEXT will have the raw text as the raw value. For example, a cell with text "John Smith" will have "John Smith" as both the raw value and the formatted value. 

                   

                  Cells with format CONTACT will have the name of the contact as a formatted value and the email address of the contact as the raw value. For example, a contact for John Smith will have "John Smith" as the formatted value and "john.smith@example.com" as the raw value. 

                   

                  Cells with format ROWLINK (aka picklist) will have the first column of the linked row as the formatted value and the row id of the linked row as the raw value. For example, a cell containing a picklist to a table that displays task status might have "Completed" as the formatted value and "row:dfcefaee-5b37-4355-8f28-40c3e4ff5dd4/ca432b2f-b8eb-431d-9fb5-cbe0342f9f03" as the raw value. 

                   

                  Cells with format AUTO or cells without any format that are auto-detected as one of the formats above will contain the raw and formatted values as mentioned above, based on the auto-detected formats. If there is no auto-detected format, the raw and formatted values will be the same as the data in the cell. 

                  
                

                - **formattedValue** *(string) --* 

                  The formatted value of the cell. This is the value that you see displayed in the cell in the UI. 

                   

                  Note that the formatted value of a cell is always represented as a string irrespective of the data that is stored in the cell. For example, if a cell contains a date, the formatted value of the cell is the string representation of the formatted date being shown in the cell in the UI. See details in the rawValue field below for how cells of different formats will have different raw and formatted values. 

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **rowIdsNotFound** *(list) --* 

          The list of row ids included in the request that were not found in the table. 

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

          Provides the pagination token to load the next page if there are more results matching the request. If a pagination token is not present in the response, it means that all data matching the request has been loaded. 

          
        

        - **workbookCursor** *(integer) --* 

          Indicates the cursor of the workbook at which the data returned by this request is read. Workbook cursor keeps increasing with every update and the increments are not sequential.

      - **formula** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A formula representing a filter function that returns zero or more matching rows from a table. Valid formulas in this field return a list of rows from a table. The most common ways of writing a formula to return a list of rows are to use the FindRow() or Filter() functions. Any other formula that returns zero or more rows is also acceptable. For example, you can use a formula that points to a cell that contains a filter function. 

        

      
      - **contextRowId** *(string) --* 

        The optional contextRowId attribute can be used to specify the row id of the context row if the filter formula contains unqualified references to table columns and needs a context row to evaluate them successfully.

    :param clientRequestToken: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The request token for performing the update action. Request tokens help to identify duplicate requests. If a call times out or fails due to a transient error like a failed network connection, you can retry the call with the same request token. The service ensures that if the first call using that request token is successfully performed, the second call will not perform the action again. 

       

      Note that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You cannot use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

          The list of rows in the table. Note that this result is paginated, so this list contains a maximum of 100 rows. 

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            An object that contains attributes about a single row in a table

            
            

            - **rowId** *(string) --* 

              The id of the row in the table.

              
            

            - **cells** *(list) --* 

              A list of cells in the table row. The cells appear in the same order as the columns of the table. 

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                An object that represents a single cell in a table.

                
                

                - **formula** *(string) --* 

                  The formula contained in the cell. This field is empty if a cell does not have a formula. 

                  
                

                - **format** *(string) --* 

                  The format of the cell. If this field is empty, then the format is either not specified in the workbook or the format is set to AUTO.

                  
                

                - **rawValue** *(string) --* 

                  The raw value of the data contained in the cell. The raw value depends on the format of the data in the cell. However the attribute in the API return value is always a string containing the raw value. 

                   

                  Cells with format DATE, DATE_TIME or TIME have the raw value as a floating point number where the whole number represents the number of days since 1/1/1900 and the fractional part represents the fraction of the day since midnight. For example, a cell with date 11/3/2020 has the raw value "44138". A cell with the time 9:00 AM has the raw value "0.375" and a cell with date/time value of 11/3/2020 9:00 AM has the raw value "44138.375". Notice that even though the raw value is a number in all three cases, it is still represented as a string. 

                   

                  Cells with format NUMBER, CURRENCY, PERCENTAGE and ACCOUNTING have the raw value of the data as the number representing the data being displayed. For example, the number 1.325 with two decimal places in the format will have it's raw value as "1.325" and formatted value as "1.33". A currency value for $10 will have the raw value as "10" and formatted value as "$10.00". A value representing 20% with two decimal places in the format will have its raw value as "0.2" and the formatted value as "20.00%". An accounting value of -$25 will have "-25" as the raw value and "$ (25.00)" as the formatted value. 

                   

                  Cells with format TEXT will have the raw text as the raw value. For example, a cell with text "John Smith" will have "John Smith" as both the raw value and the formatted value. 

                   

                  Cells with format CONTACT will have the name of the contact as a formatted value and the email address of the contact as the raw value. For example, a contact for John Smith will have "John Smith" as the formatted value and "john.smith@example.com" as the raw value. 

                   

                  Cells with format ROWLINK (aka picklist) will have the first column of the linked row as the formatted value and the row id of the linked row as the raw value. For example, a cell containing a picklist to a table that displays task status might have "Completed" as the formatted value and "row:dfcefaee-5b37-4355-8f28-40c3e4ff5dd4/ca432b2f-b8eb-431d-9fb5-cbe0342f9f03" as the raw value. 

                   

                  Cells with format AUTO or cells without any format that are auto-detected as one of the formats above will contain the raw and formatted values as mentioned above, based on the auto-detected formats. If there is no auto-detected format, the raw and formatted values will be the same as the data in the cell. 

                  
                

                - **formattedValue** *(string) --* 

                  The formatted value of the cell. This is the value that you see displayed in the cell in the UI. 

                   

                  Note that the formatted value of a cell is always represented as a string irrespective of the data that is stored in the cell. For example, if a cell contains a date, the formatted value of the cell is the string representation of the formatted date being shown in the cell in the UI. See details in the rawValue field below for how cells of different formats will have different raw and formatted values. 

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **rowIdsNotFound** *(list) --* 

          The list of row ids included in the request that were not found in the table. 

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **workbookCursor** *(integer) --* 

          Indicates the cursor of the workbook at which the data returned by this request is read. Workbook cursor keeps increasing with every update and the increments are not sequential. 

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --*

      )
    :type workbookId: string
    :param workbookId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ID of the workbook whose table rows are being queried.

       

      If a workbook with the specified id could not be found, this API throws ResourceNotFoundException. 

      

    
    :type tableId: string
    :param tableId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ID of the table whose rows are being queried.

       

      If a table with the specified id could not be found, this API throws ResourceNotFoundException. 

      

    
    :type filterFormula: dict
    :param filterFormula: **[REQUIRED]** 

      An object that represents a filter formula along with the id of the context row under which the filter function needs to evaluate.

      

    
      - **formula** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A formula representing a filter function that returns zero or more matching rows from a table. Valid formulas in this field return a list of rows from a table. The most common ways of writing a formula to return a list of rows are to use the FindRow() or Filter() functions. Any other formula that returns zero or more rows is also acceptable. For example, you can use a formula that points to a cell that contains a filter function. 

        

      
      - **contextRowId** *(string) --* 

        The optional contextRowId attribute can be used to specify the row id of the context row if the filter formula contains unqualified references to table columns and needs a context row to evaluate them successfully. 

        

      
    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **columnIds** *(list) --* 

          The list of columns in the table whose row data is returned in the result. 

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **rows** *(list) --* 

          The list of rows in the table that match the query filter. 

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            An object that contains attributes about a single row in a table

            
            

            - **rowId** *(string) --* 

              The id of the row in the table.

              
            

            - **cells** *(list) --* 

              A list of cells in the table row. The cells appear in the same order as the columns of the table. 

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                An object that represents a single cell in a table.

                
                

                - **formula** *(string) --* 

                  The formula contained in the cell. This field is empty if a cell does not have a formula. 

                  
                

                - **format** *(string) --* 

                  The format of the cell. If this field is empty, then the format is either not specified in the workbook or the format is set to AUTO.

                  
                

                - **rawValue** *(string) --* 

                  The raw value of the data contained in the cell. The raw value depends on the format of the data in the cell. However the attribute in the API return value is always a string containing the raw value. 

                   

                  Cells with format DATE, DATE_TIME or TIME have the raw value as a floating point number where the whole number represents the number of days since 1/1/1900 and the fractional part represents the fraction of the day since midnight. For example, a cell with date 11/3/2020 has the raw value "44138". A cell with the time 9:00 AM has the raw value "0.375" and a cell with date/time value of 11/3/2020 9:00 AM has the raw value "44138.375". Notice that even though the raw value is a number in all three cases, it is still represented as a string. 

                   

                  Cells with format NUMBER, CURRENCY, PERCENTAGE and ACCOUNTING have the raw value of the data as the number representing the data being displayed. For example, the number 1.325 with two decimal places in the format will have it's raw value as "1.325" and formatted value as "1.33". A currency value for $10 will have the raw value as "10" and formatted value as "$10.00". A value representing 20% with two decimal places in the format will have its raw value as "0.2" and the formatted value as "20.00%". An accounting value of -$25 will have "-25" as the raw value and "$ (25.00)" as the formatted value. 

                   

                  Cells with format TEXT will have the raw text as the raw value. For example, a cell with text "John Smith" will have "John Smith" as both the raw value and the formatted value. 

                   

                  Cells with format CONTACT will have the name of the contact as a formatted value and the email address of the contact as the raw value. For example, a contact for John Smith will have "John Smith" as the formatted value and "john.smith@example.com" as the raw value. 

                   

                  Cells with format ROWLINK (aka picklist) will have the first column of the linked row as the formatted value and the row id of the linked row as the raw value. For example, a cell containing a picklist to a table that displays task status might have "Completed" as the formatted value and "row:dfcefaee-5b37-4355-8f28-40c3e4ff5dd4/ca432b2f-b8eb-431d-9fb5-cbe0342f9f03" as the raw value. 

                   

                  Cells with format AUTO or cells without any format that are auto-detected as one of the formats above will contain the raw and formatted values as mentioned above, based on the auto-detected formats. If there is no auto-detected format, the raw and formatted values will be the same as the data in the cell. 

                  
                

                - **formattedValue** *(string) --* 

                  The formatted value of the cell. This is the value that you see displayed in the cell in the UI. 

                   

                  Note that the formatted value of a cell is always represented as a string irrespective of the data that is stored in the cell. For example, if a cell contains a date, the formatted value of the cell is the string representation of the formatted date being shown in the cell in the UI. See details in the rawValue field below for how cells of different formats will have different raw and formatted values. 

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **workbookCursor** *(integer) --* 

          Indicates the cursor of the workbook at which the data returned by this request is read. Workbook cursor keeps increasing with every update and the increments are not sequential. 

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token to resume pagination.
