.. py:class:: DataSync.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS DataSync
   

  AWS DataSync is a managed data transfer service that makes it simpler for you to automate moving data between on-premises storage and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). 

   

  This API interface reference for AWS DataSync contains documentation for a programming interface that you can use to manage AWS DataSync.

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: cancel_task_execution(**kwargs)

    

    Cancels execution of a task. 

     

    When you cancel a task execution, the transfer of some files is abruptly interrupted. The contents of files that are transferred to the destination might be incomplete or inconsistent with the source files. However, if you start a new task execution on the same task and you allow the task execution to complete, file content on the destination is complete and consistent. This applies to other unexpected failures that interrupt a task execution. In all of these cases, AWS DataSync successfully complete the transfer when you start the next task execution.

  .. py:method:: create_agent(**kwargs)

    

    Activates an AWS DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host. The activation process associates your agent with your account. In the activation process, you specify information such as the AWS Region that you want to activate the agent in. You activate the agent in the AWS Region where your target locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks are created in this AWS Region.

     

    You can activate the agent in a VPC (virtual private cloud) or provide the agent access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks without going over the public internet.

     

    You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If you use multiple agents for a source location, the status of all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task to run. 

     

    Agents are automatically updated by AWS on a regular basis, using a mechanism that ensures minimal interruption to your tasks.

      )
    :type ActivationKey: string
    :param ActivationKey: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Your agent activation key. You can get the activation key either by sending an HTTP GET request with redirects that enable you to get the agent IP address (port 80). Alternatively, you can get it from the AWS DataSync console.

       

      The redirect URL returned in the response provides you the activation key for your agent in the query string parameter ``activationKey`` . It might also include other activation-related parameters; however, these are merely defaults. The arguments you pass to this API call determine the actual configuration of your agent.

       

      For more information, see Activating an Agent in the *AWS DataSync User Guide.*  

      

    
    :type AgentName: string
    :param AgentName: 

      The name you configured for your agent. This value is a text reference that is used to identify the agent in the console.

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      The key-value pair that represents the tag that you want to associate with the agent. The value can be an empty string. This value helps you manage, filter, and search for your agents.

       

      .. note::

         

        Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @. 

         

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents a single entry in a list of AWS resource tags. ``TagListEntry`` returns an array that contains a list of tasks when the `ListTagsForResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_ListTagsForResource.html>`__ operation is called.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The key for an AWS resource tag.

    :type VpcEndpointId: string
    :param VpcEndpointId: 

      The ID of the VPC (virtual private cloud) endpoint that the agent has access to. This is the client-side VPC endpoint, also called a PrivateLink. If you don't have a PrivateLink VPC endpoint, see `Creating a VPC Endpoint Service Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-service.html#create-endpoint-service>`__ in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

       

      VPC endpoint ID looks like this: ``vpce-01234d5aff67890e1`` .

      

    
    :type SubnetArns: list
    :param SubnetArns: 

      The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the subnets in which DataSync will create elastic network interfaces for each data transfer task. The agent that runs a task must be private. When you start a task that is associated with an agent created in a VPC, or one that has access to an IP address in a VPC, then the task is also private. In this case, DataSync creates four network interfaces for each task in your subnet. For a data transfer to work, the agent must be able to route to all these four network interfaces.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type SecurityGroupArns: list

    :param Ec2Config: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The subnet and security group that the Amazon EFS file system uses. The security group that you provide needs to be able to communicate with the security group on the mount target in the subnet specified.

       

      The exact relationship between security group M (of the mount target) and security group S (which you provide for DataSync to use at this stage) is as follows: 

       

       
      * Security group M (which you associate with the mount target) must allow inbound access for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) on the NFS port (2049) from security group S. You can enable inbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group.  
       
      * Security group S (provided to DataSync to access EFS) should have a rule that enables outbound connections to the NFS port on one of the file system’s mount targets. You can enable outbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group. For information about security groups and mount targets, see Security Groups for Amazon EC2 Instances and Mount Targets in the *Amazon EFS User Guide.*   
       

      

    
      - **SubnetArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

    :type Subdirectory: string
    :param Subdirectory: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The subdirectory in the NFS file system that is used to read data from the NFS source location or write data to the NFS destination. The NFS path should be a path that's exported by the NFS server, or a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be mounted by other NFS clients in your network. 

       

      To see all the paths exported by your NFS server, run "``showmount -e nfs-server-name`` " from an NFS client that has access to your server. You can specify any directory that appears in the results, and any subdirectory of that directory. Ensure that the NFS export is accessible without Kerberos authentication. 

       

      To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs to have permissions to read all the data. To ensure this, either configure the NFS export with ``no_root_squash,`` or ensure that the permissions for all of the files that you want DataSync allow read access for all users. Doing either enables the agent to read the files. For the agent to access directories, you must additionally enable all execute access.

       

      If you are copying data to or from your AWS Snowcone device, see `NFS Server on AWS Snowcone <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-nfs-location.html#nfs-on-snowcone>`__ for more information.

       

      For information about NFS export configuration, see 18.7. The /etc/exports Configuration File in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation.

         ``Subdirectory`` must be specified with forward slashes. For example, ``/path/to/folder`` .

         

       

      To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs to have permissions to mount the SMB share, as well as to access all the data in that share. To ensure this, either ensure that the user/password specified belongs to the user who can mount the share, and who has the appropriate permissions for all of the files and directories that you want DataSync to access, or use credentials of a member of the Backup Operators group to mount the share. Doing either enables the agent to access the data. For the agent to access directories, you must additionally enable all execute access.

      

    
    :type ServerHostname: string
    :param ServerHostname: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the SMB server. This value is the IP address or Domain Name Service (DNS) name of the SMB server. An agent that is installed on-premises uses this hostname to mount the SMB server in a network.

       

      .. note::

  .. py:method:: create_task(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a task.

     

    A task includes a source location and a destination location, and a configuration that specifies how data is transferred. A task always transfers data from the source location to the destination location. The configuration specifies options such as task scheduling, bandwidth limits, etc. A task is the complete definition of a data transfer.

     

    When you create a task that transfers data between AWS services in different AWS Regions, one of the two locations that you specify must reside in the Region where DataSync is being used. The other location must be specified in a different Region.

     

    You can transfer data between commercial AWS Regions except for China, or between AWS GovCloud (US-East and US-West) Regions.

     

    .. warning::

       

      When you use DataSync to copy files or objects between AWS Regions, you pay for data transfer between Regions. This is billed as data transfer OUT from your source Region to your destination Region. For more information, see `Data Transfer pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Data_Transfer>`__ .

    :type SourceLocationArn: string
    :param SourceLocationArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source location for the task.

      

    
    :type DestinationLocationArn: string
    :param DestinationLocationArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS storage resource's location. 

      

    
    :type CloudWatchLogGroupArn: string
    :param CloudWatchLogGroupArn: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon CloudWatch log group that is used to monitor and log events in the task. 

      

    
    :type Name: string
    :param Name: 

      The name of a task. This value is a text reference that is used to identify the task in the console. 

      

    
    :type Options: dict
    :param Options: 

      The set of configuration options that control the behavior of a single execution of the task that occurs when you call ``StartTaskExecution`` . You can configure these options to preserve metadata such as user ID (UID) and group ID (GID), file permissions, data integrity verification, and so on.

       

      For each individual task execution, you can override these options by specifying the ``OverrideOptions`` before starting the task execution. For more information, see the `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ operation. 

      

    
      - **VerifyMode** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred. For more information, see `Configure task settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-task.html>`__ . 

         

        Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

         

        ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): Perform verification only on files that were transferred. 

         

        POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire destination at the end of the transfer to verify that source and destination are fully synchronized. This option isn't supported when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.

         

        NONE: No additional verification is done at the end of the transfer, but all data transmissions are integrity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.

        

      
      - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting those changes. 

         

        Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__ in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

        

      
      - **Atime** *(string) --* 

        A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis. 

         

        Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

         

        BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

         

        .. note::

           

          If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE. 

           

          If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE. 

           

        

      
      - **Mtime** *(string) --* 

        A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was written to) before the PREPARING phase. This option is required for cases when you need to run the same task more than one time. 

         

        Default value: PRESERVE. 

         

        PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

         

        NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` . 

         

        .. note::

           

          If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

           

          If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE. 

           

        

      
      - **Uid** *(string) --* 

        The POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. To learn more about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ .

         

        Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

         

        INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore UID and GID. 

        

      
      - **Gid** *(string) --* 

        The POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ . 

         

        Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

         

        INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore UID and GID. 

        

      
      - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --* 

        A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__ in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

         

        Default value: PRESERVE.

         

        PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended). 

         

        REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.

        

      
      - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and character devices in the source file system, and re-create the files with that device name and metadata on the destination. DataSync does not copy the contents of such devices, only the name and metadata. 

         

        .. note::

           

          AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

           

         

        Default value: NONE.

         

        NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended). 

         

        PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS. 

        

      
      - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ . 

         

        Default value: PRESERVE.

         

        PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore permissions. 

         

        .. note::

           

          AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

           

        

      
      - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --* 

        A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

        

      
      - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

         

        If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable the tasks to run in series. For more information, see `Queueing task executions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#queue-task-execution>`__ .

        

      
      - **LogLevel** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines the type of logs that DataSync publishes to a log stream in the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you provide. For more information about providing a log group for DataSync, see `CloudWatchLogGroupArn <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateTask.html#DataSync-CreateTask-request-CloudWatchLogGroupArn>`__ . If set to ``OFF`` , no logs are published. ``BASIC`` publishes logs on errors for individual files transferred, and ``TRANSFER`` publishes logs for every file or object that is transferred and integrity checked.

        

      
      - **TransferMode** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata that differ between the source and the destination location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the source, without comparing to the destination location. 

         

        CHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new or different content from the source location to the destination location.

         

        ALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destination, without comparing to existing content on the destination.

        

      
      - **SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied from source to destination objects. 

         

        This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information about how DataSync handles metadata, see `How DataSync Handles Metadata and Special Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html>`__ . 

         

        Default value: OWNER_DACL.

         

         **OWNER_DACL** : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

         

         
        * Object owner. 
         
        * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. 
         

         

        When choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.

         

         **OWNER_DACL_SACL** : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

         

         
        * Object owner. 
         
        * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. 
         
        * NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object. 
         

         

        Copying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information about choosing a user that ensures sufficient permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see `user <create-smb-location.html#SMBuser>`__ .

         

         **NONE** : None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied. Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for accessing the destination location. DACLs and SACLs are set based on the destination server’s configuration. 

        

      
    
    :type Excludes: list
    :param Excludes: 

      A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a task. The list should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example, ``"/folder1|/folder2"`` . 

       

       

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Specifies which files, folders, and objects to include or exclude when transferring files from source to destination.

        

      
        - **FilterType** *(string) --* 

          The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* 

          A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``/folder1|/folder2``  

           

           

          

        
      
  
    :type Schedule: dict
    :param Schedule: 

      Specifies a schedule used to periodically transfer files from a source to a destination location. The schedule should be specified in UTC time. For more information, see `Scheduling your task <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/task-scheduling.html>`__ .

      

    
      - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A cron expression that specifies when AWS DataSync initiates a scheduled transfer from a source to a destination location. 

        

      
    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags:

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source ENIs (Elastic Network Interface) that was created for your subnet.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **DestinationNetworkInterfaceArns** *(list) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination ENIs (Elastic Network Interface) that was created for your subnet.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **Options** *(dict) --* 

          The set of configuration options that control the behavior of a single execution of the task that occurs when you call ``StartTaskExecution`` . You can configure these options to preserve metadata such as user ID (UID) and group (GID), file permissions, data integrity verification, and so on.

           

          For each individual task execution, you can override these options by specifying the overriding ``OverrideOptions`` value to `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ operation. 

          
          

          - **VerifyMode** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred. For more information, see `Configure task settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-task.html>`__ . 

             

            Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

             

            ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): Perform verification only on files that were transferred. 

             

            POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire destination at the end of the transfer to verify that source and destination are fully synchronized. This option isn't supported when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.

             

            NONE: No additional verification is done at the end of the transfer, but all data transmissions are integrity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.

            
          

          - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting those changes. 

             

            Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__ in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

            
          

          - **Atime** *(string) --* 

            A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis. 

             

            Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

             

            BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

             

            NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

             

            .. note::

               

              If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE. 

               

              If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE. 

               

            
          

          - **Mtime** *(string) --* 

            A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was written to) before the PREPARING phase. This option is required for cases when you need to run the same task more than one time. 

             

            Default value: PRESERVE. 

             

            PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

             

            NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` . 

             

            .. note::

               

              If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

               

              If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE. 

               

            
          

          - **Uid** *(string) --* 

            The POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. To learn more about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ .

             

            Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

             

            INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

             

            NONE: Ignore UID and GID. 

            
          

          - **Gid** *(string) --* 

            The POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ . 

             

            Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

             

            INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

             

            NONE: Ignore UID and GID. 

            
          

          - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --* 

            A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__ in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

             

            Default value: PRESERVE.

             

            PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended). 

             

            REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.

            
          

          - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and character devices in the source file system, and re-create the files with that device name and metadata on the destination. DataSync does not copy the contents of such devices, only the name and metadata. 

             

            .. note::

               

              AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

               

             

            Default value: NONE.

             

            NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended). 

             

            PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS. 

            
          

          - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ . 

             

            Default value: PRESERVE.

             

            PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

             

            NONE: Ignore permissions. 

             

            .. note::

               

              AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

               

            
          

          - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --* 

            A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

            
          

          - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

             

            If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable the tasks to run in series. For more information, see `Queueing task executions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#queue-task-execution>`__ .

            
          

          - **LogLevel** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines the type of logs that DataSync publishes to a log stream in the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you provide. For more information about providing a log group for DataSync, see `CloudWatchLogGroupArn <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateTask.html#DataSync-CreateTask-request-CloudWatchLogGroupArn>`__ . If set to ``OFF`` , no logs are published. ``BASIC`` publishes logs on errors for individual files transferred, and ``TRANSFER`` publishes logs for every file or object that is transferred and integrity checked.

            
          

          - **TransferMode** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata that differ between the source and the destination location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the source, without comparing to the destination location. 

             

            CHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new or different content from the source location to the destination location.

             

            ALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destination, without comparing to existing content on the destination.

            
          

          - **SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied from source to destination objects. 

             

            This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information about how DataSync handles metadata, see `How DataSync Handles Metadata and Special Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html>`__ . 

             

            Default value: OWNER_DACL.

             

             **OWNER_DACL** : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

             

             
            * Object owner. 
             
            * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. 
             

             

            When choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.

             

             **OWNER_DACL_SACL** : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

             

             
            * Object owner. 
             
            * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. 
             
            * NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object. 
             

             

            Copying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information about choosing a user that ensures sufficient permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see `user <create-smb-location.html#SMBuser>`__ .

             

             **NONE** : None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied. Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for accessing the destination location. DACLs and SACLs are set based on the destination server’s configuration. 

            
      
        

        - **Excludes** *(list) --* 

          A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a task. The list should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``"/folder1|/folder2"``  

           

           

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Specifies which files, folders, and objects to include or exclude when transferring files from source to destination.

            
            

            - **FilterType** *(string) --* 

              The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``/folder1|/folder2``  

               

               

              
        
      
        

        - **Schedule** *(dict) --* 

          The schedule used to periodically transfer files from a source to a destination location.

          
          

          - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --* 

            A cron expression that specifies when AWS DataSync initiates a scheduled transfer from a source to a destination location. 

            
      
        

        - **ErrorCode** *(string) --* 

          Errors that AWS DataSync encountered during execution of the task. You can use this error code to help troubleshoot issues.

          
        

        - **ErrorDetail** *(string) --* 

          Detailed description of an error that was encountered during the task execution. You can use this information to help troubleshoot issues. 

          
        

        - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The time that the task was created.

          
    
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`DataSync.Client.exceptions.InvalidRequestException`

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        DescribeTaskExecutionResponse

        
        

        - **TaskExecutionArn** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution that was described. ``TaskExecutionArn`` is hierarchical and includes ``TaskArn`` for the task that was executed. 

           

          For example, a ``TaskExecution`` value with the ARN ``arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2/execution/exec-08ef1e88ec491019b`` executed the task with the ARN ``arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2`` . 

          
        

        - **Status** *(string) --* 

          The status of the task execution. 

           

          For detailed information about task execution statuses, see Understanding Task Statuses in the *AWS DataSync User Guide.*  

          
        

        - **Options** *(dict) --* 

          Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of a `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ operation. Behavior includes preserving metadata such as user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and file permissions, and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity verification, and so on.

           

          A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option in `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ , the default value is used. You can override the defaults options on each task execution by specifying an overriding ``Options`` value to `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ .

          
          

          - **VerifyMode** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred. For more information, see `Configure task settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-task.html>`__ . 

             

            Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

             

            ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): Perform verification only on files that were transferred. 

             

            POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire destination at the end of the transfer to verify that source and destination are fully synchronized. This option isn't supported when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.

             

            NONE: No additional verification is done at the end of the transfer, but all data transmissions are integrity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.

            
          

          - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting those changes. 

             

            Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__ in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

            
          

          - **Atime** *(string) --* 

            A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis. 

             

            Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

             

            BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

             

            NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

             

            .. note::

               

              If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE. 

               

              If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE. 

               

            
          

          - **Mtime** *(string) --* 

            A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was written to) before the PREPARING phase. This option is required for cases when you need to run the same task more than one time. 

             

            Default value: PRESERVE. 

             

            PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

             

            NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` . 

             

            .. note::

               

              If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

               

              If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE. 

               

            
          

          - **Uid** *(string) --* 

            The POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. To learn more about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ .

             

            Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

             

            INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

             

            NONE: Ignore UID and GID. 

            
          

          - **Gid** *(string) --* 

            The POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ . 

             

            Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

             

            INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

             

            NONE: Ignore UID and GID. 

            
          

          - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --* 

            A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__ in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

             

            Default value: PRESERVE.

             

            PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended). 

             

            REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.

            
          

          - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and character devices in the source file system, and re-create the files with that device name and metadata on the destination. DataSync does not copy the contents of such devices, only the name and metadata. 

             

            .. note::

               

              AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

               

             

            Default value: NONE.

             

            NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended). 

             

            PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS. 

            
          

          - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ . 

             

            Default value: PRESERVE.

             

            PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

             

            NONE: Ignore permissions. 

             

            .. note::

               

              AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

               

            
          

          - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --* 

            A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

            
          

          - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

             

            If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable the tasks to run in series. For more information, see `Queueing task executions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#queue-task-execution>`__ .

            
          

          - **LogLevel** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines the type of logs that DataSync publishes to a log stream in the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you provide. For more information about providing a log group for DataSync, see `CloudWatchLogGroupArn <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateTask.html#DataSync-CreateTask-request-CloudWatchLogGroupArn>`__ . If set to ``OFF`` , no logs are published. ``BASIC`` publishes logs on errors for individual files transferred, and ``TRANSFER`` publishes logs for every file or object that is transferred and integrity checked.

            
          

          - **TransferMode** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata that differ between the source and the destination location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the source, without comparing to the destination location. 

             

            CHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new or different content from the source location to the destination location.

             

            ALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destination, without comparing to existing content on the destination.

            
          

          - **SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags** *(string) --* 

            A value that determines which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied from source to destination objects. 

             

            This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information about how DataSync handles metadata, see `How DataSync Handles Metadata and Special Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html>`__ . 

             

            Default value: OWNER_DACL.

             

             **OWNER_DACL** : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

             

             
            * Object owner. 
             
            * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. 
             

             

            When choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.

             

             **OWNER_DACL_SACL** : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

             

             
            * Object owner. 
             
            * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. 
             
            * NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object. 
             

             

            Copying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information about choosing a user that ensures sufficient permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see `user <create-smb-location.html#SMBuser>`__ .

             

             **NONE** : None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied. Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for accessing the destination location. DACLs and SACLs are set based on the destination server’s configuration. 

            
      
        

        - **Excludes** *(list) --* 

          A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a task. The list should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``"/folder1|/folder2"``  

           

           

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Specifies which files, folders, and objects to include or exclude when transferring files from source to destination.

            
            

            - **FilterType** *(string) --* 

              The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``/folder1|/folder2``  

               

               

              
        
      
        

        - **Includes** *(list) --* 

          A list of filter rules that determines which files to include when running a task. The list should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to include. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``"/folder1|/folder2"``  

           

           

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Specifies which files, folders, and objects to include or exclude when transferring files from source to destination.

            
            

            - **FilterType** *(string) --* 

              The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``/folder1|/folder2``  

               

               

              
        
      
        

        - **StartTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The time that the task execution was started.

          
        

        - **EstimatedFilesToTransfer** *(integer) --* 

          The expected number of files that is to be transferred over the network. This value is calculated during the PREPARING phase, before the TRANSFERRING phase. This value is the expected number of files to be transferred. It's calculated based on comparing the content of the source and destination locations and finding the delta that needs to be transferred. 

          
        

        - **EstimatedBytesToTransfer** *(integer) --* 

          The estimated physical number of bytes that is to be transferred over the network.

          
        

        - **FilesTransferred** *(integer) --* 

          The actual number of files that was transferred over the network. This value is calculated and updated on an ongoing basis during the TRANSFERRING phase. It's updated periodically when each file is read from the source and sent over the network. 

           

          If failures occur during a transfer, this value can be less than ``EstimatedFilesToTransfer`` . This value can also be greater than ``EstimatedFilesTransferred`` in some cases. This element is implementation-specific for some location types, so don't use it as an indicator for a correct file number or to monitor your task execution.

          
        

        - **BytesWritten** *(integer) --* 

          The number of logical bytes written to the destination AWS storage resource.

          
        

        - **BytesTransferred** *(integer) --* 

          The physical number of bytes transferred over the network.

  .. py:method:: generate_presigned_url(ClientMethod, Params=None, ExpiresIn=3600, HttpMethod=None)

        
    Generate a presigned url given a client, its method, and arguments
    
    :type ClientMethod: string
    :param ClientMethod: The client method to presign for
    
    :type Params: dict
    :param Params: The parameters normally passed to
        ``ClientMethod``.
    
    :type ExpiresIn: int
    :param ExpiresIn: The number of seconds the presigned url is valid
        for. By default it expires in an hour (3600 seconds)
    
    :type HttpMethod: string
    :param HttpMethod: The http method to use on the generated url. By
        default, the http method is whatever is used in the method's model.
    
    :returns: The presigned url


  .. py:method:: get_paginator(operation_name)

        
    Create a paginator for an operation.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :raise OperationNotPageableError: Raised if the operation is not
        pageable.  You can use the ``client.can_paginate`` method to
        check if an operation is pageable.
    
    :rtype: L{botocore.paginate.Paginator}
    :return: A paginator object.


  .. py:method:: get_waiter(waiter_name)

        
    Returns an object that can wait for some condition.
    
    :type waiter_name: str
    :param waiter_name: The name of the waiter to get. See the waiters
        section of the service docs for a list of available waiters.
    
    :returns: The specified waiter object.
    :rtype: botocore.waiter.Waiter


  .. py:method:: list_agents(**kwargs)

    

    Returns a list of agents owned by an AWS account in the AWS Region specified in the request. The returned list is ordered by agent Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

     

    By default, this operation returns a maximum of 100 agents. This operation supports pagination that enables you to optionally reduce the number of agents returned in a response.

     

    If you have more agents than are returned in a response (that is, the response returns only a truncated list of your agents), the response contains a marker that you can specify in your next request to fetch the next page of agents.

              TYPE designates the type of location. Valid values: NFS | EFS | S3.

               

              GLOBAL_ID is the globally unique identifier of the resource that backs the location. An example for EFS is ``us-east-2.fs-abcd1234`` . An example for Amazon S3 is the bucket name, such as ``myBucket`` . An example for NFS is a valid IPv4 address or a host name compliant with Domain Name Service (DNS).

               

              SUBDIR is a valid file system path, delimited by forward slashes as is the *nix convention. For NFS and Amazon EFS, it's the export path to mount the location. For Amazon S3, it's the prefix path that you mount to and treat as the root of the location.

      )
    :type TaskArn: string
    :param TaskArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task to start.

      

    
    :type OverrideOptions: dict
    :param OverrideOptions: 

      Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of a `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ operation. Behavior includes preserving metadata such as user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and file permissions, and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity verification, and so on.

       

      A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option in `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ , the default value is used. You can override the defaults options on each task execution by specifying an overriding ``Options`` value to `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ .

      

    
      - **VerifyMode** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred. For more information, see `Configure task settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-task.html>`__ . 

         

        Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

         

        ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): Perform verification only on files that were transferred. 

         

        POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire destination at the end of the transfer to verify that source and destination are fully synchronized. This option isn't supported when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.

         

        NONE: No additional verification is done at the end of the transfer, but all data transmissions are integrity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.

        

      
      - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting those changes. 

         

        Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__ in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

        

      
      - **Atime** *(string) --* 

        A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis. 

         

        Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

         

        BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

         

        .. note::

           

          If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE. 

           

          If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE. 

           

        

      
      - **Mtime** *(string) --* 

        A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was written to) before the PREPARING phase. This option is required for cases when you need to run the same task more than one time. 

         

        Default value: PRESERVE. 

         

        PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

         

        NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` . 

         

        .. note::

           

          If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

           

          If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE. 

           

        

      
      - **Uid** *(string) --* 

        The POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. To learn more about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ .

         

        Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

         

        INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore UID and GID. 

        

      
      - **Gid** *(string) --* 

        The POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ . 

         

        Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

         

        INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore UID and GID. 

        

      
      - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --* 

        A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__ in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

         

        Default value: PRESERVE.

         

        PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended). 

         

        REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.

        

      
      - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and character devices in the source file system, and re-create the files with that device name and metadata on the destination. DataSync does not copy the contents of such devices, only the name and metadata. 

         

        .. note::

           

          AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

           

         

        Default value: NONE.

         

        NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended). 

         

        PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS. 

        

      
      - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ . 

         

        Default value: PRESERVE.

         

        PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore permissions. 

         

        .. note::

           

          AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

           

        

      
      - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --* 

        A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

        

      
      - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

         

        If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable the tasks to run in series. For more information, see `Queueing task executions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#queue-task-execution>`__ .

        

      
      - **LogLevel** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines the type of logs that DataSync publishes to a log stream in the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you provide. For more information about providing a log group for DataSync, see `CloudWatchLogGroupArn <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateTask.html#DataSync-CreateTask-request-CloudWatchLogGroupArn>`__ . If set to ``OFF`` , no logs are published. ``BASIC`` publishes logs on errors for individual files transferred, and ``TRANSFER`` publishes logs for every file or object that is transferred and integrity checked.

        

      
      - **TransferMode** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata that differ between the source and the destination location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the source, without comparing to the destination location. 

         

        CHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new or different content from the source location to the destination location.

         

        ALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destination, without comparing to existing content on the destination.

        

      
      - **SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied from source to destination objects. 

         

        This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information about how DataSync handles metadata, see `How DataSync Handles Metadata and Special Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html>`__ . 

         

        Default value: OWNER_DACL.

         

         **OWNER_DACL** : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

         

         
        * Object owner. 
         
        * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. 
         

         

        When choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.

         

         **OWNER_DACL_SACL** : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

         

         
        * Object owner. 
         
        * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. 
         
        * NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object. 
         

         

        Copying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information about choosing a user that ensures sufficient permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see `user <create-smb-location.html#SMBuser>`__ .

         

         **NONE** : None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied. Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for accessing the destination location. DACLs and SACLs are set based on the destination server’s configuration. 

        

      
    
    :type Includes: list
    :param Includes: 

      A list of filter rules that determines which files to include when running a task. The pattern should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to include. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe). For example: ``"/folder1|/folder2"``

    :type LocationArn: string
    :param LocationArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the NFS location to update.

      

    
    :type Subdirectory: string
    :param Subdirectory: 

      The subdirectory in the NFS file system that is used to read data from the NFS source location or write data to the NFS destination. The NFS path should be a path that's exported by the NFS server, or a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be mounted by other NFS clients in your network.

       

      To see all the paths exported by your NFS server, run "``showmount -e nfs-server-name`` " from an NFS client that has access to your server. You can specify any directory that appears in the results, and any subdirectory of that directory. Ensure that the NFS export is accessible without Kerberos authentication. 

       

      To transfer all the data in the folder that you specified, DataSync must have permissions to read all the data. To ensure this, either configure the NFS export with ``no_root_squash`` , or ensure that the files you want DataSync to access have permissions that allow read access for all users. Doing either option enables the agent to read the files. For the agent to access directories, you must additionally enable all execute access.

       

      If you are copying data to or from your AWS Snowcone device, see `NFS Server on AWS Snowcone <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-nfs-location.html#nfs-on-snowcone>`__ for more information.

       

      For information about NFS export configuration, see 18.7. The /etc/exports Configuration File in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation.

    :param MountOptions: 

      Represents the mount options that are available for DataSync to access an NFS location.

      

    
      - **Version** *(string) --* 

        The specific NFS version that you want DataSync to use to mount your NFS share. If the server refuses to use the version specified, the sync will fail. If you don't specify a version, DataSync defaults to ``AUTOMATIC`` . That is, DataSync automatically selects a version based on negotiation with the NFS server.

         

        You can specify the following NFS versions:

         

         
        * **`NFSv3 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1813>`__ ** - stateless protocol version that allows for asynchronous writes on the server. 
         
        * **`NFSv4.0 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3530>`__ ** - stateful, firewall-friendly protocol version that supports delegations and pseudo filesystems. 
         
        * **`NFSv4.1 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5661>`__ ** - stateful protocol version that supports sessions, directory delegations, and parallel data processing. Version 4.1 also includes all features available in version 4.0.

         ``Subdirectory`` must be specified with forward slashes. For example, ``/path/to/folder`` .

         

       

      To transfer all the data in the folder that you specified, DataSync must have permissions to mount the SMB share and to access all the data in that share. To ensure this, do either of the following:

       

       
      * Ensure that the user/password specified belongs to the user who can mount the share and who has the appropriate permissions for all of the files and directories that you want DataSync to access. 
       
      * Use credentials of a member of the Backup Operators group to mount the share.

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource name of the task to update.

      

    
    :type Options: dict
    :param Options: 

      Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of a `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ operation. Behavior includes preserving metadata such as user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and file permissions, and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity verification, and so on.

       

      A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option in `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ , the default value is used. You can override the defaults options on each task execution by specifying an overriding ``Options`` value to `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ .

      

    
      - **VerifyMode** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred. For more information, see `Configure task settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-task.html>`__ . 

         

        Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

         

        ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): Perform verification only on files that were transferred. 

         

        POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire destination at the end of the transfer to verify that source and destination are fully synchronized. This option isn't supported when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.

         

        NONE: No additional verification is done at the end of the transfer, but all data transmissions are integrity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.

        

      
      - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting those changes. 

         

        Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__ in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

        

      
      - **Atime** *(string) --* 

        A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis. 

         

        Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

         

        BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

         

        .. note::

           

          If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE. 

           

          If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE. 

           

        

      
      - **Mtime** *(string) --* 

        A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was written to) before the PREPARING phase. This option is required for cases when you need to run the same task more than one time. 

         

        Default value: PRESERVE. 

         

        PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

         

        NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` . 

         

        .. note::

           

          If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

           

          If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE. 

           

        

      
      - **Uid** *(string) --* 

        The POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. To learn more about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ .

         

        Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

         

        INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore UID and GID. 

        

      
      - **Gid** *(string) --* 

        The POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ . 

         

        Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

         

        INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore UID and GID. 

        

      
      - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --* 

        A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__ in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

         

        Default value: PRESERVE.

         

        PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended). 

         

        REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.

        

      
      - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and character devices in the source file system, and re-create the files with that device name and metadata on the destination. DataSync does not copy the contents of such devices, only the name and metadata. 

         

        .. note::

           

          AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

           

         

        Default value: NONE.

         

        NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended). 

         

        PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS. 

        

      
      - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ . 

         

        Default value: PRESERVE.

         

        PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore permissions. 

         

        .. note::

           

          AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

           

        

      
      - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --* 

        A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

        

      
      - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

         

        If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable the tasks to run in series. For more information, see `Queueing task executions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#queue-task-execution>`__ .

        

      
      - **LogLevel** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines the type of logs that DataSync publishes to a log stream in the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you provide. For more information about providing a log group for DataSync, see `CloudWatchLogGroupArn <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateTask.html#DataSync-CreateTask-request-CloudWatchLogGroupArn>`__ . If set to ``OFF`` , no logs are published. ``BASIC`` publishes logs on errors for individual files transferred, and ``TRANSFER`` publishes logs for every file or object that is transferred and integrity checked.

        

      
      - **TransferMode** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata that differ between the source and the destination location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the source, without comparing to the destination location. 

         

        CHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new or different content from the source location to the destination location.

         

        ALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destination, without comparing to existing content on the destination.

        

      
      - **SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied from source to destination objects. 

         

        This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information about how DataSync handles metadata, see `How DataSync Handles Metadata and Special Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html>`__ . 

         

        Default value: OWNER_DACL.

         

         **OWNER_DACL** : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

         

         
        * Object owner. 
         
        * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. 
         

         

        When choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.

         

         **OWNER_DACL_SACL** : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

         

         
        * Object owner. 
         
        * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. 
         
        * NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object. 
         

         

        Copying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information about choosing a user that ensures sufficient permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see `user <create-smb-location.html#SMBuser>`__ .

         

         **NONE** : None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied. Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for accessing the destination location. DACLs and SACLs are set based on the destination server’s configuration. 

        

      
    
    :type Excludes: list
    :param Excludes: 

      A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a task. The list should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``"/folder1|/folder2"``  

       

       

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Specifies which files, folders, and objects to include or exclude when transferring files from source to destination.

        

      
        - **FilterType** *(string) --* 

          The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* 

          A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``/folder1|/folder2``  

           

           

          

        
      
  
    :type Schedule: dict
    :param Schedule: 

      Specifies a schedule used to periodically transfer files from a source to a destination location. You can configure your task to execute hourly, daily, weekly or on specific days of the week. You control when in the day or hour you want the task to execute. The time you specify is UTC time. For more information, see `Scheduling your task <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/task-scheduling.html>`__ .

      

    
      - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A cron expression that specifies when AWS DataSync initiates a scheduled transfer from a source to a destination location.

    :type TaskExecutionArn: string
    :param TaskExecutionArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the specific task execution that is being updated. 

      

    
    :type Options: dict
    :param Options: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of a `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ operation. Behavior includes preserving metadata such as user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and file permissions, and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity verification, and so on.

       

      A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option in `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ , the default value is used. You can override the defaults options on each task execution by specifying an overriding ``Options`` value to `StartTaskExecution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html>`__ .

      

    
      - **VerifyMode** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred. For more information, see `Configure task settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-task.html>`__ . 

         

        Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

         

        ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): Perform verification only on files that were transferred. 

         

        POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire destination at the end of the transfer to verify that source and destination are fully synchronized. This option isn't supported when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.

         

        NONE: No additional verification is done at the end of the transfer, but all data transmissions are integrity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.

        

      
      - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting those changes. 

         

        Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__ in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

        

      
      - **Atime** *(string) --* 

        A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis. 

         

        Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

         

        BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

         

        .. note::

           

          If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE. 

           

          If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE. 

           

        

      
      - **Mtime** *(string) --* 

        A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was written to) before the PREPARING phase. This option is required for cases when you need to run the same task more than one time. 

         

        Default value: PRESERVE. 

         

        PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

         

        NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` . 

         

        .. note::

           

          If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

           

          If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE. 

           

        

      
      - **Uid** *(string) --* 

        The POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. To learn more about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ .

         

        Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

         

        INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore UID and GID. 

        

      
      - **Gid** *(string) --* 

        The POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ . 

         

        Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

         

        INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore UID and GID. 

        

      
      - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --* 

        A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__ in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

         

        Default value: PRESERVE.

         

        PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended). 

         

        REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.

        

      
      - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and character devices in the source file system, and re-create the files with that device name and metadata on the destination. DataSync does not copy the contents of such devices, only the name and metadata. 

         

        .. note::

           

          AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

           

         

        Default value: NONE.

         

        NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended). 

         

        PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS. 

        

      
      - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see `Metadata Copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__ . 

         

        Default value: PRESERVE.

         

        PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

         

        NONE: Ignore permissions. 

         

        .. note::

           

          AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

           

        

      
      - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --* 

        A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

        

      
      - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

         

        If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable the tasks to run in series. For more information, see `Queueing task executions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#queue-task-execution>`__ .

        

      
      - **LogLevel** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines the type of logs that DataSync publishes to a log stream in the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you provide. For more information about providing a log group for DataSync, see `CloudWatchLogGroupArn <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateTask.html#DataSync-CreateTask-request-CloudWatchLogGroupArn>`__ . If set to ``OFF`` , no logs are published. ``BASIC`` publishes logs on errors for individual files transferred, and ``TRANSFER`` publishes logs for every file or object that is transferred and integrity checked.

        

      
      - **TransferMode** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata that differ between the source and the destination location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the source, without comparing to the destination location. 

         

        CHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new or different content from the source location to the destination location.

         

        ALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destination, without comparing to existing content on the destination.

        

      
      - **SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags** *(string) --* 

        A value that determines which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied from source to destination objects. 

         

        This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information about how DataSync handles metadata, see `How DataSync Handles Metadata and Special Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html>`__ . 

         

        Default value: OWNER_DACL.

         

         **OWNER_DACL** : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

         

         
        * Object owner. 
         
        * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. 
         

         

        When choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.

         

         **OWNER_DACL_SACL** : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

         

         
        * Object owner. 
         
        * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. 
         
        * NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object. 
         

         

        Copying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information about choosing a user that ensures sufficient permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see `user <create-smb-location.html#SMBuser>`__ .

         

         **NONE** : None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied. Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for accessing the destination location. DACLs and SACLs are set based on the destination server’s configuration.

        ListLocationsResponse

        
        

        - **Locations** *(list) --* 

          An array that contains a list of locations.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Represents a single entry in a list of locations. ``LocationListEntry`` returns an array that contains a list of locations when the `ListLocations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_ListLocations.html>`__ operation is called.

            
            

            - **LocationArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the location. For Network File System (NFS) or Amazon EFS, the location is the export path. For Amazon S3, the location is the prefix path that you want to mount and use as the root of the location.

              
            

            - **LocationUri** *(string) --* 

              Represents a list of URLs of a location. ``LocationUri`` returns an array that contains a list of locations when the `ListLocations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_ListLocations.html>`__ operation is called.

               

              Format: ``TYPE://GLOBAL_ID/SUBDIR`` .

               

              TYPE designates the type of location. Valid values: NFS | EFS | S3.

               

              GLOBAL_ID is the globally unique identifier of the resource that backs the location. An example for EFS is ``us-east-2.fs-abcd1234`` . An example for Amazon S3 is the bucket name, such as ``myBucket`` . An example for NFS is a valid IPv4 address or a host name compliant with Domain Name Service (DNS).

               

              SUBDIR is a valid file system path, delimited by forward slashes as is the *nix convention. For NFS and Amazon EFS, it's the export path to mount the location. For Amazon S3, it's the prefix path that you mount to and treat as the root of the location.
