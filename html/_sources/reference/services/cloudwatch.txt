.. py:class:: CloudWatch.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon CloudWatch
  

  Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources and applications.

   

  CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.

   

  In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: delete_alarms(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the specified alarms. You can delete up to 100 alarms in one operation. However, this total can include no more than one composite alarm. For example, you could delete 99 metric alarms and one composite alarms with one operation, but you can't delete two composite alarms with one operation.

     

    In the event of an error, no alarms are deleted.

     

    .. note::

       

      It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.

       

      To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the ``AlarmRule`` of one of the alarms to ``False`` . 

       

      Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a cycle in the evaluation path.

To get complete information about these alarms, perform another ``DescribeAlarms`` operation and specify the parent alarm names in the ``AlarmNames`` parameter.

         

      

    
    :type ParentsOfAlarmName: string
    :param ParentsOfAlarmName: 

      If you use this parameter and specify the name of a metric or composite alarm, the operation returns information about the "parent" alarms of the alarm you specify. These are the composite alarms that have ``AlarmRule`` parameters that reference the alarm named in ``ParentsOfAlarmName`` . Information about the alarm that you specify in ``ParentsOfAlarmName`` is not returned.

       

      If you specify ``ParentsOfAlarmName`` , you cannot specify any other parameters in the request except for ``MaxRecords`` and ``NextToken`` . If you do so, you receive a validation error.

       

      .. note::

         

        Only the Alarm Name and ARN are returned by this operation when you use this parameter. To get complete information about these alarms, perform another ``DescribeAlarms`` operation and specify the parent alarm names in the ``AlarmNames`` parameter.

         

      

    
    :type StateValue: string
    :param StateValue: 

      Specify this parameter to receive information only about alarms that are currently in the state that you specify.

      

    
    :type ActionPrefix: string
    :param ActionPrefix: 

      Use this parameter to filter the results of the operation to only those alarms that use a certain alarm action. For example, you could specify the ARN of an SNS topic to find all alarms that send notifications to that topic.

      

    
    :type MaxRecords: integer
    :param MaxRecords: 

      The maximum number of alarm descriptions to retrieve.

      

    
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      The token returned by a previous call to indicate that there is more data available.

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                
                

                - **Name** *(string) --*

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  
            
          
            

            - **Period** *(integer) --* 

              The period, in seconds, over which the statistic is applied.

              
            

            - **Unit** *(string) --* 

              The unit of the metric associated with the alarm.

              
            

            - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --* 

              The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold.

              
            

            - **DatapointsToAlarm** *(integer) --* 

              The number of data points that must be breaching to trigger the alarm.

              
            

            - **Threshold** *(float) --* 

              The value to compare with the specified statistic.

              
            

            - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* 

              The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.

              
            

            - **TreatMissingData** *(string) --* 

              Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If this parameter is omitted, the default behavior of ``missing`` is used.

              
            

            - **EvaluateLowSampleCountPercentile** *(string) --* 

              Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If ``ignore`` , the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If ``evaluate`` or this parameter is not used, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available.

              
            

            - **Metrics** *(list) --* 

              An array of MetricDataQuery structures, used in an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each structure either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression. One item in the Metrics array is the math expression that the alarm watches. This expression by designated by having ``ReturnData`` set to true.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                This structure is used in both ``GetMetricData`` and ``PutMetricAlarm`` . The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.

                 

                When used in ``GetMetricData`` , it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math expression on metric data. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include up to 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures.

                 

                When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each ``MetricDataQuery`` in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single ``PutMetricAlarm`` call can include up to 20 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a ``MetricStat`` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the ``Expression`` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those ``Expression`` structures, one must have ``True`` as the value for ``ReturnData`` . The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.

                 

                Any expression used in a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

                 

                Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a ``GetMetricData`` operation or a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.

                
                

                - **Id** *(string) --* 

                  A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData`` . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.

                  
                

                - **MetricStat** *(dict) --* 

                  The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data.

                   

                  Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

                  
                  

                  - **Metric** *(dict) --* 

                    The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

                    
                    

                    - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

                      The namespace of the metric.

                      
                    

                    - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

                      The name of the metric. This is a required field.

                      
                    

                    - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

                      The dimensions for the metric.

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                        
                        

                        - **Name** *(string) --* 

                          The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                          
                        

                        - **Value** *(string) --* 

                          The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                          
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **Period** *(integer) --* 

                    The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.

                     

                    If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

                     

                     
                    * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). 
                     
                    * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). 
                     
                    * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
                     

                    
                  

                  - **Stat** *(string) --* 

                    The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.

                    
                  

                  - **Unit** *(string) --* 

                    When you are using a ``Put`` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

                     

                    In a ``Get`` operation, if you omit ``Unit`` then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

                    
              
                

                - **Expression** *(string) --* 

                  The math expression to be performed on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression. This expression can use the ``Id`` of the other metrics to refer to those metrics, and can also use the ``Id`` of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

                   

                  Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

                  
                

                - **Label** *(string) --* 

                  A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.

                   

                  You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see `Using Dynamic Labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`__ .

                  
                

                - **ReturnData** *(boolean) --* 

                  When used in ``GetMetricData`` , this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify ``False`` . If you omit this, the default of ``True`` is used.

                   

                  When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , specify ``True`` for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, specify ``ReturnData`` as False.

                  
                

                - **Period** *(integer) --* 

                  The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` operation that includes a ``StorageResolution of 1 second`` .

                  
            
          
            

            - **ThresholdMetricId** *(string) --* 

              In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is the ID of the ``ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND`` function used as the threshold for the alarm.

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          The token that marks the start of the next batch of returned results.

          
    
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`CloudWatch.Client.exceptions.InvalidNextToken`

    

  .. py:method:: describe_alarms_for_metric(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves the alarms for the specified metric. To filter the results, specify a statistic, period, or unit.

     

    This operation retrieves only standard alarms that are based on the specified metric. It does not return alarms based on math expressions that use the specified metric, or composite alarms that use the specified metric.

              An explanation for the alarm state, in text format.

              
            

            - **StateReasonData** *(string) --* 

              An explanation for the alarm state, in JSON format.

              
            

            - **StateUpdatedTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

              The time stamp of the last update to the alarm state.

              
            

            - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the metric associated with the alarm, if this is an alarm based on a single metric.

              
            

            - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

              The namespace of the metric associated with the alarm.

              
            

            - **Statistic** *(string) --* 

              The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ``ExtendedStatistic`` .

              
            

            - **ExtendedStatistic** *(string) --* 

              The percentile statistic for the metric associated with the alarm. Specify a value between p0.0 and p100.

              
            

            - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

              The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                
                

                - **Name** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  
            
          
            

            - **Period** *(integer) --* 

              The period, in seconds, over which the statistic is applied.

              
            

            - **Unit** *(string) --* 

              The unit of the metric associated with the alarm.

              
            

            - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --* 

              The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold.

              
            

            - **DatapointsToAlarm** *(integer) --* 

              The number of data points that must be breaching to trigger the alarm.

              
            

            - **Threshold** *(float) --* 

              The value to compare with the specified statistic.

              
            

            - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* 

              The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.

              
            

            - **TreatMissingData** *(string) --* 

              Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If this parameter is omitted, the default behavior of ``missing`` is used.

              
            

            - **EvaluateLowSampleCountPercentile** *(string) --* 

              Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If ``ignore`` , the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If ``evaluate`` or this parameter is not used, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available.

              
            

            - **Metrics** *(list) --* 

              An array of MetricDataQuery structures, used in an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each structure either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression. One item in the Metrics array is the math expression that the alarm watches. This expression by designated by having ``ReturnData`` set to true.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                This structure is used in both ``GetMetricData`` and ``PutMetricAlarm`` . The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.

                 

                When used in ``GetMetricData`` , it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math expression on metric data. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include up to 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures.

                 

                When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each ``MetricDataQuery`` in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single ``PutMetricAlarm`` call can include up to 20 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a ``MetricStat`` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the ``Expression`` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those ``Expression`` structures, one must have ``True`` as the value for ``ReturnData`` . The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.

                 

                Any expression used in a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

                 

                Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a ``GetMetricData`` operation or a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.

                
                

                - **Id** *(string) --* 

                  A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData`` . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.

                  
                

                - **MetricStat** *(dict) --* 

                  The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data.

                   

                  Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

                  
                  

                  - **Metric** *(dict) --* 

                    The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

                    
                    

                    - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

                      The namespace of the metric.

                      
                    

                    - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

                      The name of the metric. This is a required field.

                      
                    

                    - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

                      The dimensions for the metric.

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                        
                        

                        - **Name** *(string) --* 

                          The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                          
                        

                        - **Value** *(string) --* 

                          The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                          
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **Period** *(integer) --* 

                    The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.

                     

                    If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

                     

                     
                    * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). 
                     
                    * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). 
                     
                    * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
                     

                    
                  

                  - **Stat** *(string) --* 

                    The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.

                    
                  

                  - **Unit** *(string) --* 

                    When you are using a ``Put`` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

                     

                    In a ``Get`` operation, if you omit ``Unit`` then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

                    
              
                

                - **Expression** *(string) --* 

                  The math expression to be performed on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression. This expression can use the ``Id`` of the other metrics to refer to those metrics, and can also use the ``Id`` of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

                   

                  Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

                  
                

                - **Label** *(string) --* 

                  A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.

                   

                  You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see `Using Dynamic Labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`__ .

                  
                

                - **ReturnData** *(boolean) --* 

                  When used in ``GetMetricData`` , this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify ``False`` . If you omit this, the default of ``True`` is used.

                   

                  When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , specify ``True`` for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, specify ``ReturnData`` as False.

                  
                

                - **Period** *(integer) --* 

                  The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` operation that includes a ``StorageResolution of 1 second`` .

                  
            
          
            

            - **ThresholdMetricId** *(string) --* 

              In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is the ID of the ``ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND`` function used as the threshold for the alarm.

              
        
      
    

  .. py:method:: describe_anomaly_detectors(**kwargs)

    

    Lists the anomaly detection models that you have created in your account. You can list all models in your account or filter the results to only the models that are related to a certain namespace, metric name, or metric dimension.

              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                
                

                - **Name** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  
            
          
            

            - **Stat** *(string) --* 

              The statistic associated with the anomaly detection model.

              
            

            - **Configuration** *(dict) --* 

              The configuration specifies details about how the anomaly detection model is to be trained, including time ranges to exclude from use for training the model, and the time zone to use for the metric.

              
              

              - **ExcludedTimeRanges** *(list) --* 

                An array of time ranges to exclude from use when the anomaly detection model is trained. Use this to make sure that events that could cause unusual values for the metric, such as deployments, aren't used when CloudWatch creates the model.

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  Specifies one range of days or times to exclude from use for training an anomaly detection model.

                  
                  

                  - **StartTime** *(datetime) --* 

                    The start time of the range to exclude. The format is ``yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`` . For example, ``2019-07-01T23:59:59`` .

                    
                  

                  - **EndTime** *(datetime) --* 

                    The end time of the range to exclude. The format is ``yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`` . For example, ``2019-07-01T23:59:59`` .

                    
              
            
              

              - **MetricTimezone** *(string) --* 

                The time zone to use for the metric. This is useful to enable the model to automatically account for daylight savings time changes if the metric is sensitive to such time changes.

                 

                To specify a time zone, use the name of the time zone as specified in the standard tz database. For more information, see `tz database <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database>`__ .

                
          
            

            - **StateValue** *(string) --* 

              The current status of the anomaly detector's training. The possible values are ``TRAINED | PENDING_TRAINING | TRAINED_INSUFFICIENT_DATA``  

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token that you can use in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.

    This operation returns the time series data collected by a Contributor Insights rule. The data includes the identity and number of contributors to the log group.

     

    You can also optionally return one or more statistics about each data point in the time series. These statistics can include the following:

     

     
    * ``UniqueContributors`` -- the number of unique contributors for each data point. 
     
    * ``MaxContributorValue`` -- the value of the top contributor for each data point. The identity of the contributor might change for each data point in the graph. If this rule aggregates by COUNT, the top contributor for each data point is the contributor with the most occurrences in that period. If the rule aggregates by SUM, the top contributor is the contributor with the highest sum in the log field specified by the rule's ``Value`` , during that period. 
     
    * ``SampleCount`` -- the number of data points matched by the rule. 
     
    * ``Sum`` -- the sum of the values from all contributors during the time period represented by that data point. 
     
    * ``Minimum`` -- the minimum value from a single observation during the time period represented by that data point. 
     
    * ``Maximum`` -- the maximum value from a single observation during the time period represented by that data point. 
     
    * ``Average`` -- the average value from all contributors during the time period represented by that data point.

      Specifies which metrics to use for aggregation of contributor values for the report. You can specify one or more of the following metrics:

       

       
      * ``UniqueContributors`` -- the number of unique contributors for each data point. 
       
      * ``MaxContributorValue`` -- the value of the top contributor for each data point. The identity of the contributor might change for each data point in the graph. If this rule aggregates by COUNT, the top contributor for each data point is the contributor with the most occurrences in that period. If the rule aggregates by SUM, the top contributor is the contributor with the highest sum in the log field specified by the rule's ``Value`` , during that period. 
       
      * ``SampleCount`` -- the number of data points matched by the rule. 
       
      * ``Sum`` -- the sum of the values from all contributors during the time period represented by that data point. 
       
      * ``Minimum`` -- the minimum value from a single observation during the time period represented by that data point. 
       
      * ``Maximum`` -- the maximum value from a single observation during the time period represented by that data point. 
       
      * ``Average`` -- the average value from all contributors during the time period represented by that data point.

  .. py:method:: get_metric_data(**kwargs)

    

    You can use the ``GetMetricData`` API to retrieve as many as 500 different metrics in a single request, with a total of as many as 100,800 data points. You can also optionally perform math expressions on the values of the returned statistics, to create new time series that represent new insights into your data. For example, using Lambda metrics, you could divide the Errors metric by the Invocations metric to get an error rate time series. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

     

    Calls to the ``GetMetricData`` API have a different pricing structure than calls to ``GetMetricStatistics`` . For more information about pricing, see `Amazon CloudWatch Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/>`__ .

     

    Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:

     

     
    * Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a ``StorageResolution`` of 1. 
     
    * Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days. 
     
    * Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days. 
     
    * Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months). 
     

     

    Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.

     

    If you omit ``Unit`` in your request, all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

    :type MetricDataQueries: list
    :param MetricDataQueries: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The metric queries to be returned. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include as many as 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures. Each of these structures can specify either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to perform on retrieved data. 

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        This structure is used in both ``GetMetricData`` and ``PutMetricAlarm`` . The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.

         

        When used in ``GetMetricData`` , it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math expression on metric data. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include up to 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures.

         

        When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each ``MetricDataQuery`` in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single ``PutMetricAlarm`` call can include up to 20 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a ``MetricStat`` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the ``Expression`` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those ``Expression`` structures, one must have ``True`` as the value for ``ReturnData`` . The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.

         

        Any expression used in a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

         

        Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a ``GetMetricData`` operation or a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.

        

      
        - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData`` . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.

          

        
        - **MetricStat** *(dict) --* 

          The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data.

           

          Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          

        
          - **Metric** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

            

          
            - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

              The namespace of the metric.

              

            
            - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the metric. This is a required field.

              

            
            - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

              The dimensions for the metric.

              

            
              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                

              
                - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  

                
                - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  

                
              
          
          
          - **Period** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.

             

            If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

             

             
            * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). 
             
            * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). 
             
            * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
             

            

          
          - **Stat** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.

            

          
          - **Unit** *(string) --* 

            When you are using a ``Put`` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

             

            In a ``Get`` operation, if you omit ``Unit`` then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

            

          
        
        - **Expression** *(string) --* 

          The math expression to be performed on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression. This expression can use the ``Id`` of the other metrics to refer to those metrics, and can also use the ``Id`` of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

           

          Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          

        
        - **Label** *(string) --* 

          A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.

           

          You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see `Using Dynamic Labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`__ .

          

        
        - **ReturnData** *(boolean) --* 

          When used in ``GetMetricData`` , this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify ``False`` . If you omit this, the default of ``True`` is used.

           

          When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , specify ``True`` for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, specify ``ReturnData`` as False.

          

        
        - **Period** *(integer) --* 

          The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` operation that includes a ``StorageResolution of 1 second`` .

          

        
      
  
    :type StartTime: datetime
    :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The time stamp indicating the earliest data to be returned.

       

      The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp. 

       

      CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:

       

       
      * Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00. 
       
      * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00. 
       
      * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00. 
       

       

      If you set ``Period`` to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or 30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15. 

       

      For better performance, specify ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` values that align with the value of the metric's ``Period`` and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the ``Period`` of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as ``StartTime`` can get a faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the ``StartTime`` .

      

    
    :type EndTime: datetime
    :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The time stamp indicating the latest data to be returned.

       

      The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to the specified time stamp.

       

      For better performance, specify ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` values that align with the value of the metric's ``Period`` and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the ``Period`` of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as ``EndTime`` can get a faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the ``EndTime`` .

      

    
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      Include this value, if it was returned by the previous ``GetMetricData`` operation, to get the next set of data points.

      

    
    :type ScanBy: string
    :param ScanBy: 

      The order in which data points should be returned. ``TimestampDescending`` returns the newest data first and paginates when the ``MaxDatapoints`` limit is reached. ``TimestampAscending`` returns the oldest data first and paginates when the ``MaxDatapoints`` limit is reached.

      

    
    :type MaxDatapoints: integer
    :param MaxDatapoints: 

      The maximum number of data points the request should return before paginating. If you omit this, the default of 100,800 is used.

      

    
    :type LabelOptions: dict
    :param LabelOptions: 

      This structure includes the ``Timezone`` parameter, which you can use to specify your time zone so that the labels of returned data display the correct time for your time zone. 

      

    
      - **Timezone** *(string) --* 

        The time zone to use for metric data return in this operation. The format is ``+`` or ``-`` followed by four digits. The first two digits indicate the number of hours ahead or behind of UTC, and the final two digits are the number of minutes. For example, +0130 indicates a time zone that is 1 hour and 30 minutes ahead of UTC. The default is +0000.

            - **Timestamps** *(list) --* 

              The timestamps for the data points, formatted in Unix timestamp format. The number of timestamps always matches the number of values and the value for Timestamps[x] is Values[x].

              
              

              - *(datetime) --* 
          
            

            - **Values** *(list) --* 

              The data points for the metric corresponding to ``Timestamps`` . The number of values always matches the number of timestamps and the timestamp for Values[x] is Timestamps[x].

            - **StatusCode** *(string) --* 

              The status of the returned data. ``Complete`` indicates that all data points in the requested time range were returned. ``PartialData`` means that an incomplete set of data points were returned. You can use the ``NextToken`` value that was returned and repeat your request to get more data points. ``NextToken`` is not returned if you are performing a math expression. ``InternalError`` indicates that an error occurred. Retry your request using ``NextToken`` , if present.

              
            

            - **Messages** *(list) --* 

              A list of messages with additional information about the data returned.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A message returned by the ``GetMetricData`` API, including a code and a description.

                
                

                - **Code** *(string) --* 

                  The error code or status code associated with the message.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The message text.

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token that marks the next batch of returned results.

          
        

        - **Messages** *(list) --* 

          Contains a message about this ``GetMetricData`` operation, if the operation results in such a message. An example of a message that might be returned is ``Maximum number of allowed metrics exceeded`` . If there is a message, as much of the operation as possible is still executed.

           

          A message appears here only if it is related to the global ``GetMetricData`` operation. Any message about a specific metric returned by the operation appears in the ``MetricDataResult`` object returned for that metric.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A message returned by the ``GetMetricData`` API, including a code and a description.

            
            

            - **Code** *(string) --* 

              The error code or status code associated with the message.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The message text.

              
        
      
    
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`CloudWatch.Client.exceptions.InvalidNextToken`

    

  .. py:method:: get_metric_statistics(**kwargs)

    

    Gets statistics for the specified metric.

     

    The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are not returned in chronological order.

     

    CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned.

     

    CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:

     

     
    * The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1. 
     
    * The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal. 
     

     

    Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.

     

    Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:

     

     
    * Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a ``StorageResolution`` of 1. 
     
    * Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days. 
     
    * Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days. 
     
    * Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months). 
     

     

    Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.

     

    CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of July 9, 2016.

      The namespace of the metric, with or without spaces.

      

    
    :type MetricName: string
    :param MetricName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the metric, with or without spaces.

      

    
    :type Dimensions: list
    :param Dimensions: 

      The dimensions. If the metric contains multiple dimensions, you must include a value for each dimension. CloudWatch treats each unique combination of dimensions as a separate metric. If a specific combination of dimensions was not published, you can't retrieve statistics for it. You must specify the same dimensions that were used when the metrics were created. For an example, see `Dimension Combinations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#dimension-combinations>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* . For more information about specifying dimensions, see `Publishing Metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

          

        
      
  
    :type StartTime: datetime
    :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The time stamp that determines the first data point to return. Start times are evaluated relative to the time that CloudWatch receives the request.

       

      The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-03T23:00:00Z).

       

      CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:

       

       
      * Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00. 
       
      * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00. 
       
      * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00. 
       

       

      If you set ``Period`` to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or 30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15. 

      

    
    :type EndTime: datetime
    :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The time stamp that determines the last data point to return.

       

      The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to the specified time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-10T23:00:00Z).

      

    
    :type Period: integer
    :param Period: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.

       

      If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

       

       
      * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). 
       
      * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). 
       
      * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
       

      

    
    :type Statistics: list
    :param Statistics: 

      The metric statistics, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ``ExtendedStatistics`` . When calling ``GetMetricStatistics`` , you must specify either ``Statistics`` or ``ExtendedStatistics`` , but not both.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ExtendedStatistics: list
    :param ExtendedStatistics: 

      The percentile statistics. Specify values between p0.0 and p100. When calling ``GetMetricStatistics`` , you must specify either ``Statistics`` or ``ExtendedStatistics`` , but not both. Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Unit: string
    :param Unit: 

      The unit for a given metric. If you omit ``Unit`` , all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

  .. py:method:: get_metric_widget_image(**kwargs)

    

    You can use the ``GetMetricWidgetImage`` API to retrieve a snapshot graph of one or more Amazon CloudWatch metrics as a bitmap image. You can then embed this image into your services and products, such as wiki pages, reports, and documents. You could also retrieve images regularly, such as every minute, and create your own custom live dashboard.

     

    The graph you retrieve can include all CloudWatch metric graph features, including metric math and horizontal and vertical annotations.

     

    There is a limit of 20 transactions per second for this API. Each ``GetMetricWidgetImage`` action has the following limits:

     

     
    * As many as 100 metrics in the graph. 
     
    * Up to 100 KB uncompressed payload.

          MetricWidget='string',
          OutputFormat='string'
      )
    :type MetricWidget: string
    :param MetricWidget: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A JSON string that defines the bitmap graph to be retrieved. The string includes the metrics to include in the graph, statistics, annotations, title, axis limits, and so on. You can include only one ``MetricWidget`` parameter in each ``GetMetricWidgetImage`` call.

       

      For more information about the syntax of ``MetricWidget`` see `GetMetricWidgetImage\: Metric Widget Structure and Syntax <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/CloudWatch-Metric-Widget-Structure.html>`__ .

       

      If any metric on the graph could not load all the requested data points, an orange triangle with an exclamation point appears next to the graph legend.

      

    
    :type OutputFormat: string
    :param OutputFormat: 

      The format of the resulting image. Only PNG images are supported.

       

      The default is ``png`` . If you specify ``png`` , the API returns an HTTP response with the content-type set to ``text/xml`` . The image data is in a ``MetricWidgetImage`` field. For example:

       

       ``<GetMetricWidgetImageResponse xmlns=<URLstring>>``  

       

       ``<GetMetricWidgetImageResult>``  

       

       ``<MetricWidgetImage>``  

       

       ``iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAlgAAAGQEAYAAAAip...``  

       

       ``</MetricWidgetImage>``  

       

       ``</GetMetricWidgetImageResult>``  

       

       ``<ResponseMetadata>``  

       

       ``<RequestId>6f0d4192-4d42-11e8-82c1-f539a07e0e3b</RequestId>``  

       

       ``</ResponseMetadata>``  

       

       ``</GetMetricWidgetImageResponse>``  

       

      The ``image/png`` setting is intended only for custom HTTP requests. For most use cases, and all actions using an AWS SDK, you should use ``png`` . If you specify ``image/png`` , the HTTP response has a content-type set to ``image/png`` , and the body of the response is a PNG image.

     ``ListDashboards`` returns up to 1000 results on one page. If there are more than 1000 dashboards, you can call ``ListDashboards`` again and include the value you received for ``NextToken`` in the first call, to receive the next 1000 results.

    After you create a metric, allow up to 15 minutes before the metric appears. You can see statistics about the metric sooner by using `GetMetricData <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html>`__ or `GetMetricStatistics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html>`__ .

     

     ``ListMetrics`` doesn't return information about metrics if those metrics haven't reported data in the past two weeks. To retrieve those metrics, use `GetMetricData <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html>`__ or `GetMetricStatistics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html>`__ .

  .. py:method:: put_composite_alarm(**kwargs)

    

    Creates or updates a *composite alarm* . When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule are met.

     

    The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include metric alarms and other composite alarms.

     

    Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state.

     

    Currently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite alarms are notifying SNS topics.

     

    .. note::

       

      It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.

       

      To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the ``AlarmRule`` of one of the alarms to ``False`` . 

       

      Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a cycle in the evaluation path. 

       

     

    When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` . The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. For a composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the only time that the alarm can be in ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` state.

     

    When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

     

    If you are an IAM user, you must have ``iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`` to create a composite alarm that has Systems Manager OpsItem actions.

      The name for the composite alarm. This name must be unique within the Region.

      

    
    :type AlarmRule: string
    :param AlarmRule: **[REQUIRED]** 

      An expression that specifies which other alarms are to be evaluated to determine this composite alarm's state. For each alarm that you reference, you designate a function that specifies whether that alarm needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. You can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple functions in a single expression. You can use parenthesis to logically group the functions in your expression.

       

      You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms that are to be evaluated.

       

      Functions can include the following:

       

       
      * ``ALARM("*alarm-name* or *alarm-ARN* ")`` is TRUE if the named alarm is in ALARM state. 
       
      * ``OK("*alarm-name* or *alarm-ARN* ")`` is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK state. 
       
      * ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA("*alarm-name* or *alarm-ARN* ")`` is TRUE if the named alarm is in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. 
       
      * ``TRUE`` always evaluates to TRUE. 
       
      * ``FALSE`` always evaluates to FALSE. 
       

       

      TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex ``AlarmRule`` structure, and for testing your alarm actions.

       

      Alarm names specified in ``AlarmRule`` can be surrounded with double-quotes ("), but do not have to be.

       

      The following are some examples of ``AlarmRule`` :

       

       
      * ``ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)`` specifies that the composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if both CPUUtilizationTooHigh and DiskReadOpsTooHigh alarms are in ALARM state. 
       
      * ``ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND NOT ALARM(DeploymentInProgress)`` specifies that the alarm goes to ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh is in ALARM state and DeploymentInProgress is not in ALARM state. This example reduces alarm noise during a known deployment window. 
       
      * ``(ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) OR ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)) AND OK(NetworkOutTooHigh)`` goes into ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh OR DiskReadOpsTooHigh is in ALARM state, and if NetworkOutTooHigh is in OK state. This provides another example of using a composite alarm to prevent noise. This rule ensures that you are not notified with an alarm action on high CPU or disk usage if a known network problem is also occurring. 
       

       

      The ``AlarmRule`` can specify as many as 100 "children" alarms. The ``AlarmRule`` expression can have as many as 500 elements. Elements are child alarms, TRUE or FALSE statements, and parentheses.

      

    
    :type InsufficientDataActions: list

      The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

  .. py:method:: put_dashboard(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an existing dashboard. If you update a dashboard, the entire contents are replaced with what you specify here.

     

    All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.

     

    A simple way to create a dashboard using ``PutDashboard`` is to copy an existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use ``GetDashboard`` , and then use the data returned within ``DashboardBody`` as the template for the new dashboard when you call ``PutDashboard`` .

     

    When you create a dashboard with ``PutDashboard`` , a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console. This message could also point console users to the location of the ``DashboardBody`` script or the CloudFormation template used to create the dashboard.

    Creates a Contributor Insights rule. Rules evaluate log events in a CloudWatch Logs log group, enabling you to find contributor data for the log events in that log group. For more information, see `Using Contributor Insights to Analyze High-Cardinality Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContributorInsights.html>`__ .

     

    If you create a rule, delete it, and then re-create it with the same name, historical data from the first time the rule was created might not be available.

    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      A list of key-value pairs to associate with the Contributor Insights rule. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a rule.

       

      Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only the resources that have certain tag values.

       

      To be able to associate tags with a rule, you must have the ``cloudwatch:TagResource`` permission in addition to the ``cloudwatch:PutInsightRule`` permission.

       

      If you are using this operation to update an existing Contributor Insights rule, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored.

  .. py:method:: put_metric_alarm(**kwargs)

    

    Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified metric, metric math expression, or anomaly detection model.

     

    Alarms based on anomaly detection models cannot have Auto Scaling actions.

     

    When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` . The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed.

     

    When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

     

    If you are an IAM user, you must have Amazon EC2 permissions for some alarm operations:

     

     
    * The ``iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`` for all alarms with EC2 actions 
     
    * The ``iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`` to create an alarm with Systems Manager OpsItem actions. 
     

     

    The first time you create an alarm in the AWS Management Console, the CLI, or by using the PutMetricAlarm API, CloudWatch creates the necessary service-linked role for you. The service-linked roles are called ``AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents`` and ``AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchAlarms_ActionSSM`` . For more information, see `AWS service-linked role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role>`__ .

      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type MetricName: string
    :param MetricName: 

      The name for the metric associated with the alarm. For each ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, you must specify either ``MetricName`` or a ``Metrics`` array.

       

      If you are creating an alarm based on a math expression, you cannot specify this parameter, or any of the ``Dimensions`` , ``Period`` , ``Namespace`` , ``Statistic`` , or ``ExtendedStatistic`` parameters. Instead, you specify all this information in the ``Metrics`` array.

      

    
    :type Namespace: string
    :param Namespace: 

      The namespace for the metric associated specified in ``MetricName`` .

      

    
    :type Statistic: string
    :param Statistic: 

      The statistic for the metric specified in ``MetricName`` , other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ``ExtendedStatistic`` . When you call ``PutMetricAlarm`` and specify a ``MetricName`` , you must specify either ``Statistic`` or ``ExtendedStatistic,`` but not both.

      

    
    :type ExtendedStatistic: string
    :param ExtendedStatistic: 

      The percentile statistic for the metric specified in ``MetricName`` . Specify a value between p0.0 and p100. When you call ``PutMetricAlarm`` and specify a ``MetricName`` , you must specify either ``Statistic`` or ``ExtendedStatistic,`` but not both.

      

    
    :type Dimensions: list
    :param Dimensions: 

      The dimensions for the metric specified in ``MetricName`` .

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

          

        
      
  
    :type Period: integer
    :param Period: 

      The length, in seconds, used each time the metric specified in ``MetricName`` is evaluated. Valid values are 10, 30, and any multiple of 60.

       

       ``Period`` is required for alarms based on static thresholds. If you are creating an alarm based on a metric math expression, you specify the period for each metric within the objects in the ``Metrics`` array.

       

      Be sure to specify 10 or 30 only for metrics that are stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call with a ``StorageResolution`` of 1. If you specify a period of 10 or 30 for a metric that does not have sub-minute resolution, the alarm still attempts to gather data at the period rate that you specify. In this case, it does not receive data for the attempts that do not correspond to a one-minute data resolution, and the alarm might often lapse into INSUFFICENT_DATA status. Specifying 10 or 30 also sets this alarm as a high-resolution alarm, which has a higher charge than other alarms. For more information about pricing, see `Amazon CloudWatch Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/>`__ .

       

      An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one day, so ``Period`` multiplied by ``EvaluationPeriods`` cannot be more than 86,400 seconds.

      

    
    :type Unit: string
    :param Unit: 

      The unit of measure for the statistic. For example, the units for the Amazon EC2 NetworkIn metric are Bytes because NetworkIn tracks the number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces. You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units help provide conceptual meaning to your data. Metric data points that specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately.

       

      If you don't specify ``Unit`` , CloudWatch retrieves all unit types that have been published for the metric and attempts to evaluate the alarm. Usually, metrics are published with only one unit, so the alarm works as intended.

       

      However, if the metric is published with multiple types of units and you don't specify a unit, the alarm's behavior is not defined and it behaves predictably.

       

      We recommend omitting ``Unit`` so that you don't inadvertently specify an incorrect unit that is not published for this metric. Doing so causes the alarm to be stuck in the ``INSUFFICIENT DATA`` state.

      

    
    :type EvaluationPeriods: integer
    :param EvaluationPeriods: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold. If you are setting an alarm that requires that a number of consecutive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this value specifies that number. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm, this value is the N.

       

      An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one day, so this number multiplied by ``Period`` cannot be more than 86,400 seconds.

      

    
    :type DatapointsToAlarm: integer
    :param DatapointsToAlarm: 

      The number of data points that must be breaching to trigger the alarm. This is used only if you are setting an "M out of N" alarm. In that case, this value is the M. For more information, see `Evaluating an Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarm-evaluation>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

      

    
    :type Threshold: float
    :param Threshold: 

      The value against which the specified statistic is compared.

       

      This parameter is required for alarms based on static thresholds, but should not be used for alarms based on anomaly detection models.

      

    
    :type ComparisonOperator: string
    :param ComparisonOperator: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.

       

      The values ``LessThanLowerOrGreaterThanUpperThreshold`` , ``LessThanLowerThreshold`` , and ``GreaterThanUpperThreshold`` are used only for alarms based on anomaly detection models.

      

    
    :type TreatMissingData: string
    :param TreatMissingData: 

      Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If ``TreatMissingData`` is omitted, the default behavior of ``missing`` is used. For more information, see `Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms Treats Missing Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-missing-data>`__ .

       

      Valid Values: ``breaching | notBreaching | ignore | missing``  

      

    
    :type EvaluateLowSampleCountPercentile: string
    :param EvaluateLowSampleCountPercentile: 

      Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If you specify ``ignore`` , the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If you specify ``evaluate`` or omit this parameter, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available. For more information, see `Percentile-Based CloudWatch Alarms and Low Data Samples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#percentiles-with-low-samples>`__ .

       

      Valid Values: ``evaluate | ignore``  

      

    
    :type Metrics: list
    :param Metrics: 

      An array of ``MetricDataQuery`` structures that enable you to create an alarm based on the result of a metric math expression. For each ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, you must specify either ``MetricName`` or a ``Metrics`` array.

       

      Each item in the ``Metrics`` array either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression.

       

      One item in the ``Metrics`` array is the expression that the alarm watches. You designate this expression by setting ``ReturnData`` to true for this object in the array. For more information, see `MetricDataQuery <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_MetricDataQuery.html>`__ .

       

      If you use the ``Metrics`` parameter, you cannot include the ``MetricName`` , ``Dimensions`` , ``Period`` , ``Namespace`` , ``Statistic`` , or ``ExtendedStatistic`` parameters of ``PutMetricAlarm`` in the same operation. Instead, you retrieve the metrics you are using in your math expression as part of the ``Metrics`` array.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        This structure is used in both ``GetMetricData`` and ``PutMetricAlarm`` . The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.

         

        When used in ``GetMetricData`` , it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math expression on metric data. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include up to 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures.

         

        When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each ``MetricDataQuery`` in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single ``PutMetricAlarm`` call can include up to 20 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a ``MetricStat`` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the ``Expression`` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those ``Expression`` structures, one must have ``True`` as the value for ``ReturnData`` . The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.

         

        Any expression used in a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

         

        Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a ``GetMetricData`` operation or a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.

        

      
        - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData`` . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.

          

        
        - **MetricStat** *(dict) --* 

          The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data.

           

          Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          

        
          - **Metric** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

            

          
            - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

              The namespace of the metric.

              

            
            - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the metric. This is a required field.

              

            
            - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

              The dimensions for the metric.

              

            
              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                

              
                - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  

                
                - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  

                
              
          
          
          - **Period** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.

             

            If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

             

             
            * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). 
             
            * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). 
             
            * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
             

            

          
          - **Stat** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.

            

          
          - **Unit** *(string) --* 

            When you are using a ``Put`` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

             

            In a ``Get`` operation, if you omit ``Unit`` then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

            

          
        
        - **Expression** *(string) --* 

          The math expression to be performed on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression. This expression can use the ``Id`` of the other metrics to refer to those metrics, and can also use the ``Id`` of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

           

          Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          

        
        - **Label** *(string) --* 

          A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.

           

          You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see `Using Dynamic Labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`__ .

          

        
        - **ReturnData** *(boolean) --* 

          When used in ``GetMetricData`` , this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify ``False`` . If you omit this, the default of ``True`` is used.

           

          When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , specify ``True`` for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, specify ``ReturnData`` as False.

          

        
        - **Period** *(integer) --* 

          The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` operation that includes a ``StorageResolution of 1 second`` .

          

        
      
  
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      A list of key-value pairs to associate with the alarm. You can associate as many as 50 tags with an alarm.

       

      Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

       

      If you are using this operation to update an existing alarm, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing alarm, use `TagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html>`__ or `UntagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html>`__ .

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A key-value pair associated with a CloudWatch resource.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A string that you can use to assign a value. The combination of tag keys and values can help you organize and categorize your resources.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value for the specified tag key.

          

        
      
  
    :type ThresholdMetricId: string
    :param ThresholdMetricId: 

      If this is an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, make this value match the ID of the ``ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND`` function.

       

      For an example of how to use this parameter, see the **Anomaly Detection Model Alarm** example on this page.

       

      If your alarm uses this parameter, it cannot have Auto Scaling actions.

      

    
    
    :returns: None
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`CloudWatch.Client.exceptions.LimitExceededFault`

    

  .. py:method:: put_metric_data(**kwargs)

    

    Publishes metric data points to Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch associates the data points with the specified metric. If the specified metric does not exist, CloudWatch creates the metric. When CloudWatch creates a metric, it can take up to fifteen minutes for the metric to appear in calls to `ListMetrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_ListMetrics.html>`__ .

     

    You can publish either individual data points in the ``Value`` field, or arrays of values and the number of times each value occurred during the period by using the ``Values`` and ``Counts`` fields in the ``MetricDatum`` structure. Using the ``Values`` and ``Counts`` method enables you to publish up to 150 values per metric with one ``PutMetricData`` request, and supports retrieving percentile statistics on this data.

     

    Each ``PutMetricData`` request is limited to 40 KB in size for HTTP POST requests. You can send a payload compressed by gzip. Each request is also limited to no more than 20 different metrics.

     

    Although the ``Value`` parameter accepts numbers of type ``Double`` , CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of -2^360 to 2^360. In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.

     

    You can use up to 10 dimensions per metric to further clarify what data the metric collects. Each dimension consists of a Name and Value pair. For more information about specifying dimensions, see `Publishing Metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

     

    You specify the time stamp to be associated with each data point. You can specify time stamps that are as much as two weeks before the current date, and as much as 2 hours after the current day and time.

     

    Data points with time stamps from 24 hours ago or longer can take at least 48 hours to become available for `GetMetricData <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html>`__ or `GetMetricStatistics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html>`__ from the time they are submitted. Data points with time stamps between 3 and 24 hours ago can take as much as 2 hours to become available for for `GetMetricData <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html>`__ or `GetMetricStatistics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html>`__ .

     

    CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:

     

     
    * The ``SampleCount`` value of the statistic set is 1 and ``Min`` , ``Max`` , and ``Sum`` are all equal. 
     
    * The ``Min`` and ``Max`` are equal, and ``Sum`` is equal to ``Min`` multiplied by ``SampleCount`` .

    :type Namespace: string
    :param Namespace: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The namespace for the metric data.

      The data for the metric. The array can include no more than 20 metrics per call.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Encapsulates the information sent to either create a metric or add new values to be aggregated into an existing metric.

        

      
        - **MetricName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the metric.

          

        
        - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

          The dimensions associated with the metric.

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

            

          
            - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

              

            
            - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

              

            
          
      
        - **Timestamp** *(datetime) --* 

          The time the metric data was received, expressed as the number of milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

          

        
        - **Value** *(float) --* 

          The value for the metric.

           

          Although the parameter accepts numbers of type Double, CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of -2^360 to 2^360. In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.

          

        
        - **StatisticValues** *(dict) --* 

          The statistical values for the metric.

          

        
          - **SampleCount** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The number of samples used for the statistic set.

            

          
          - **Sum** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The sum of values for the sample set.

            

          
          - **Minimum** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The minimum value of the sample set.

            

          
          - **Maximum** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The maximum value of the sample set.

            

          
        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          Array of numbers representing the values for the metric during the period. Each unique value is listed just once in this array, and the corresponding number in the ``Counts`` array specifies the number of times that value occurred during the period. You can include up to 150 unique values in each ``PutMetricData`` action that specifies a ``Values`` array.

           

          Although the ``Values`` array accepts numbers of type ``Double`` , CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of -2^360 to 2^360. In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.

          

        
          - *(float) --* 

          
      
        - **Counts** *(list) --* 

          Array of numbers that is used along with the ``Values`` array. Each number in the ``Count`` array is the number of times the corresponding value in the ``Values`` array occurred during the period. 

           

          If you omit the ``Counts`` array, the default of 1 is used as the value for each count. If you include a ``Counts`` array, it must include the same amount of values as the ``Values`` array.

          

        
          - *(float) --* 

          
      
        - **Unit** *(string) --* 

          When you are using a ``Put`` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

           

          In a ``Get`` operation, this displays the unit that is used for the metric.

          

        
        - **StorageResolution** *(integer) --* 

          Valid values are 1 and 60. Setting this to 1 specifies this metric as a high-resolution metric, so that CloudWatch stores the metric with sub-minute resolution down to one second. Setting this to 60 specifies this metric as a regular-resolution metric, which CloudWatch stores at 1-minute resolution. Currently, high resolution is available only for custom metrics. For more information about high-resolution metrics, see `High-Resolution Metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* . 

           

          This field is optional, if you do not specify it the default of 60 is used.

  .. py:method:: put_metric_stream(**kwargs)

    

    Creates or updates a metric stream. Metric streams can automatically stream CloudWatch metrics to AWS destinations including Amazon S3 and to many third-party solutions.

     

    For more information, see `Using Metric Streams <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Metric-Streams.html>`__ .

     

    To create a metric stream, you must be logged on to an account that has the ``iam:PassRole`` permission and either the ``CloudWatchFullAccess`` policy or the ``cloudwatch:PutMetricStream`` permission.

     

    When you create or update a metric stream, you choose one of the following:

     

     
    * Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account. 
     
    * Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account, except for the namespaces that you list in ``ExcludeFilters`` . 
     
    * Stream metrics from only the metric namespaces that you list in ``IncludeFilters`` . 
     

     

    When you use ``PutMetricStream`` to create a new metric stream, the stream is created in the ``running`` state. If you use it to update an existing stream, the state of the stream is not changed.

  .. py:method:: set_alarm_state(**kwargs)

    

    Temporarily sets the state of an alarm for testing purposes. When the updated state differs from the previous value, the action configured for the appropriate state is invoked. For example, if your alarm is configured to send an Amazon SNS message when an alarm is triggered, temporarily changing the alarm state to ``ALARM`` sends an SNS message.

     

    Metric alarms returns to their actual state quickly, often within seconds. Because the metric alarm state change happens quickly, it is typically only visible in the alarm's **History** tab in the Amazon CloudWatch console or through `DescribeAlarmHistory <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAlarmHistory.html>`__ .

     

    If you use ``SetAlarmState`` on a composite alarm, the composite alarm is not guaranteed to return to its actual state. It returns to its actual state only once any of its children alarms change state. It is also reevaluated if you update its configuration.

     

    If an alarm triggers EC2 Auto Scaling policies or application Auto Scaling policies, you must include information in the ``StateReasonData`` parameter to enable the policy to take the correct action.

  .. py:method:: tag_resource(**kwargs)

    

    Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch resource. Currently, the only CloudWatch resources that can be tagged are alarms and Contributor Insights rules.

     

    Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

     

    Tags don't have any semantic meaning to AWS and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

     

    You can use the ``TagResource`` action with an alarm that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

     

    You can associate as many as 50 tags with a CloudWatch resource.

      )
    :type AlarmNames: list
    :param AlarmNames: 

      The names of the alarms to retrieve information about.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type AlarmNamePrefix: string
    :param AlarmNamePrefix: 

      An alarm name prefix. If you specify this parameter, you receive information about all alarms that have names that start with this prefix.

       

      If this parameter is specified, you cannot specify ``AlarmNames`` .

      

    
    :type AlarmTypes: list
    :param AlarmTypes: 

      Use this parameter to specify whether you want the operation to return metric alarms or composite alarms. If you omit this parameter, only metric alarms are returned.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ChildrenOfAlarmName: string
    :param ChildrenOfAlarmName: 

      If you use this parameter and specify the name of a composite alarm, the operation returns information about the "children" alarms of the alarm you specify. These are the metric alarms and composite alarms referenced in the ``AlarmRule`` field of the composite alarm that you specify in ``ChildrenOfAlarmName`` . Information about the composite alarm that you name in ``ChildrenOfAlarmName`` is not returned.

       

      If you specify ``ChildrenOfAlarmName`` , you cannot specify any other parameters in the request except for ``MaxRecords`` and ``NextToken`` . If you do so, you receive a validation error.

       

      .. note::

         

        Only the ``Alarm Name`` , ``ARN`` , ``StateValue`` (OK/ALARM/INSUFFICIENT_DATA), and ``StateUpdatedTimestamp`` information are returned by this operation when you use this parameter. To get complete information about these alarms, perform another ``DescribeAlarms`` operation and specify the parent alarm names in the ``AlarmNames`` parameter.

         

      

    
    :type ParentsOfAlarmName: string
    :param ParentsOfAlarmName: 

      If you use this parameter and specify the name of a metric or composite alarm, the operation returns information about the "parent" alarms of the alarm you specify. These are the composite alarms that have ``AlarmRule`` parameters that reference the alarm named in ``ParentsOfAlarmName`` . Information about the alarm that you specify in ``ParentsOfAlarmName`` is not returned.

       

      If you specify ``ParentsOfAlarmName`` , you cannot specify any other parameters in the request except for ``MaxRecords`` and ``NextToken`` . If you do so, you receive a validation error.

       

      .. note::

         

        Only the Alarm Name and ARN are returned by this operation when you use this parameter. To get complete information about these alarms, perform another ``DescribeAlarms`` operation and specify the parent alarm names in the ``AlarmNames`` parameter.

         

      

    
    :type StateValue: string
    :param StateValue: 

      Specify this parameter to receive information only about alarms that are currently in the state that you specify.

      

    
    :type ActionPrefix: string
    :param ActionPrefix: 

      Use this parameter to filter the results of the operation to only those alarms that use a certain alarm action. For example, you could specify the ARN of an SNS topic to find all alarms that send notifications to that topic.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

        

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

              The percentile statistic for the metric associated with the alarm. Specify a value between p0.0 and p100.

              
            

            - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

              The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                
                

                - **Name** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  
            
          
            

            - **Period** *(integer) --* 

              The period, in seconds, over which the statistic is applied.

              
            

            - **Unit** *(string) --* 

              The unit of the metric associated with the alarm.

              
            

            - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --* 

              The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold.

              
            

            - **DatapointsToAlarm** *(integer) --* 

              The number of data points that must be breaching to trigger the alarm.

              
            

            - **Threshold** *(float) --* 

              The value to compare with the specified statistic.

              
            

            - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* 

              The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.

              
            

            - **TreatMissingData** *(string) --* 

              Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If this parameter is omitted, the default behavior of ``missing`` is used.

              
            

            - **EvaluateLowSampleCountPercentile** *(string) --* 

              Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If ``ignore`` , the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If ``evaluate`` or this parameter is not used, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available.

              
            

            - **Metrics** *(list) --* 

              An array of MetricDataQuery structures, used in an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each structure either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression. One item in the Metrics array is the math expression that the alarm watches. This expression by designated by having ``ReturnData`` set to true.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                This structure is used in both ``GetMetricData`` and ``PutMetricAlarm`` . The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.

                 

                When used in ``GetMetricData`` , it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math expression on metric data. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include up to 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures.

                 

                When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each ``MetricDataQuery`` in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single ``PutMetricAlarm`` call can include up to 20 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a ``MetricStat`` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the ``Expression`` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those ``Expression`` structures, one must have ``True`` as the value for ``ReturnData`` . The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.

                 

                Any expression used in a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

                 

                Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a ``GetMetricData`` operation or a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.

                
                

                - **Id** *(string) --* 

                  A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData`` . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.

                  
                

                - **MetricStat** *(dict) --* 

                  The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data.

                   

                  Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

                  
                  

                  - **Metric** *(dict) --* 

                    The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

                    
                    

                    - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

                      The namespace of the metric.

                      
                    

                    - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

                      The name of the metric. This is a required field.

                      
                    

                    - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

                      The dimensions for the metric.

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                        
                        

                        - **Name** *(string) --* 

                          The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                          
                        

                        - **Value** *(string) --* 

                          The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                          
                    
                  
                
                  

                  - **Period** *(integer) --* 

                    The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.

                     

                    If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

                     

                     
                    * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). 
                     
                    * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). 
                     
                    * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
                     

                    
                  

                  - **Stat** *(string) --* 

                    The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.

                    
                  

                  - **Unit** *(string) --* 

                    When you are using a ``Put`` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

                     

                    In a ``Get`` operation, if you omit ``Unit`` then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

                    
              
                

                - **Expression** *(string) --* 

                  The math expression to be performed on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression. This expression can use the ``Id`` of the other metrics to refer to those metrics, and can also use the ``Id`` of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

                   

                  Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

                  
                

                - **Label** *(string) --* 

                  A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.

                   

                  You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see `Using Dynamic Labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`__ .

                  
                

                - **ReturnData** *(boolean) --* 

                  When used in ``GetMetricData`` , this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify ``False`` . If you omit this, the default of ``True`` is used.

                   

                  When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , specify ``True`` for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, specify ``ReturnData`` as False.

                  
                

                - **Period** *(integer) --* 

                  The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` operation that includes a ``StorageResolution of 1 second`` .

                  
            
          
            

            - **ThresholdMetricId** *(string) --* 

              In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is the ID of the ``ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND`` function used as the threshold for the alarm.

    :type MetricDataQueries: list
    :param MetricDataQueries: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The metric queries to be returned. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include as many as 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures. Each of these structures can specify either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to perform on retrieved data. 

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        This structure is used in both ``GetMetricData`` and ``PutMetricAlarm`` . The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.

         

        When used in ``GetMetricData`` , it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math expression on metric data. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include up to 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures.

         

        When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each ``MetricDataQuery`` in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single ``PutMetricAlarm`` call can include up to 20 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a ``MetricStat`` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the ``Expression`` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those ``Expression`` structures, one must have ``True`` as the value for ``ReturnData`` . The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.

         

        Any expression used in a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

         

        Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a ``GetMetricData`` operation or a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.

        

      
        - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData`` . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.

          

        
        - **MetricStat** *(dict) --* 

          The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data.

           

          Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          

        
          - **Metric** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

            

          
            - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

              The namespace of the metric.

              

            
            - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the metric. This is a required field.

              

            
            - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

              The dimensions for the metric.

              

            
              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                

              
                - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  

                
                - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  

                
              
          
          
          - **Period** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.

             

            If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

             

             
            * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). 
             
            * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). 
             
            * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
             

            

          
          - **Stat** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.

            

          
          - **Unit** *(string) --* 

            When you are using a ``Put`` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

             

            In a ``Get`` operation, if you omit ``Unit`` then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

            

          
        
        - **Expression** *(string) --* 

          The math expression to be performed on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression. This expression can use the ``Id`` of the other metrics to refer to those metrics, and can also use the ``Id`` of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

           

          Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          

        
        - **Label** *(string) --* 

          A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.

           

          You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see `Using Dynamic Labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`__ .

          

        
        - **ReturnData** *(boolean) --* 

          When used in ``GetMetricData`` , this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify ``False`` . If you omit this, the default of ``True`` is used.

           

          When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , specify ``True`` for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, specify ``ReturnData`` as False.

          

        
        - **Period** *(integer) --* 

          The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` operation that includes a ``StorageResolution of 1 second`` .

          

        
      
  
    :type StartTime: datetime
    :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The time stamp indicating the earliest data to be returned.

       

      The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp. 

       

      CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:

       

       
      * Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00. 
       
      * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00. 
       
      * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00. 
       

       

      If you set ``Period`` to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or 30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15. 

       

      For better performance, specify ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` values that align with the value of the metric's ``Period`` and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the ``Period`` of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as ``StartTime`` can get a faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the ``StartTime`` .

      

    
    :type EndTime: datetime
    :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The time stamp indicating the latest data to be returned.

       

      The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to the specified time stamp.

       

      For better performance, specify ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` values that align with the value of the metric's ``Period`` and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the ``Period`` of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as ``EndTime`` can get a faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the ``EndTime`` .

      

    
    :type ScanBy: string
    :param ScanBy: 

      The order in which data points should be returned. ``TimestampDescending`` returns the newest data first and paginates when the ``MaxDatapoints`` limit is reached. ``TimestampAscending`` returns the oldest data first and paginates when the ``MaxDatapoints`` limit is reached.

      

    
    :type LabelOptions: dict
    :param LabelOptions: 

      This structure includes the ``Timezone`` parameter, which you can use to specify your time zone so that the labels of returned data display the correct time for your time zone. 

      

    
      - **Timezone** *(string) --* 

        The time zone to use for metric data return in this operation. The format is ``+`` or ``-`` followed by four digits. The first two digits indicate the number of hours ahead or behind of UTC, and the final two digits are the number of minutes. For example, +0130 indicates a time zone that is 1 hour and 30 minutes ahead of UTC. The default is +0000. 

        

      
    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

        

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

          - *(dict) --* 

            Represents a specific metric.

            
            

            - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

              The namespace of the metric.

              
            

            - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the metric. This is a required field.

              
            

            - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

              The dimensions for the metric.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                
                

                - **Name** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

.. py:class:: CloudWatch.ServiceResource()

  A resource representing Amazon CloudWatch::

    
    import boto3
    
    cloudwatch = boto3.resource('cloudwatch')

  
  These are the resource's available sub-resources:
  
  *   :py:meth:`Alarm()`

  
  *   :py:meth:`Metric()`

  
  These are the resource's available collections:
  
  *   :py:attr:`alarms`

  
  *   :py:attr:`metrics`

  
  .. rst-class:: admonition-title
  
  Sub-resources
  
  Sub-resources are methods that create a new instance of a child resource. This resource's identifiers get passed along to the child.
  For more information about sub-resources refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<subresources_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: Alarm(name)

    Creates a Alarm resource.::

      alarm = cloudwatch.Alarm('name')

    :type name: string
    :param name: The Alarm's name identifier. This **must** be set.
    
    :rtype: :py:class:`CloudWatch.Alarm`
    :returns: A Alarm resource
    

  .. py:method:: Metric(namespace,name)

    Creates a Metric resource.::

      metric = cloudwatch.Metric('namespace','name')

    :type namespace: string
    :param namespace: The Metric's namespace identifier. This **must** be set.
    :type name: string
    :param name: The Metric's name identifier. This **must** be set.
    
    :rtype: :py:class:`CloudWatch.Metric`
    :returns: A Metric resource
    
  .. rst-class:: admonition-title
  
  Collections
  
  Collections provide an interface to iterate over and manipulate groups of resources. 
  For more information about collections refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<guide_collections>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: alarms

    A collection of Alarm resources.A Alarm Collection will include all resources by default, and extreme caution should be taken when performing actions on all resources.

    .. py:method:: all()

      Creates an iterable of all Alarm resources in the collection.

      :rtype: list(:py:class:`cloudwatch.Alarm`)
      :returns: A list of Alarm resources
      

    .. py:method:: delete()

      

      Deletes the specified alarms. You can delete up to 100 alarms in one operation. However, this total can include no more than one composite alarm. For example, you could delete 99 metric alarms and one composite alarms with one operation, but you can't delete two composite alarms with one operation.

       

      In the event of an error, no alarms are deleted.

       

      .. note::

         

        It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.

         

        To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the ``AlarmRule`` of one of the alarms to ``False`` . 

         

        Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a cycle in the evaluation path.

  .. py:attribute:: alarm_name

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The name of the alarm.

      

  .. py:attribute:: comparison_operator

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.

      

  .. py:attribute:: datapoints_to_alarm

    

    - *(integer) --* 

      The number of data points that must be breaching to trigger the alarm.

      

  .. py:attribute:: dimensions

    

    - *(list) --* 

      The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm.

      
      

      - *(dict) --* 

        A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

        
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

          
        

        - **Value** *(string) --* 

          The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

          
    
  

  .. py:attribute:: evaluate_low_sample_count_percentile

    

    - *(string) --* 

      Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If ``ignore`` , the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If ``evaluate`` or this parameter is not used, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available.

      

  .. py:attribute:: evaluation_periods

    

    - *(integer) --* 

      The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold.

      

  .. py:attribute:: extended_statistic

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The percentile statistic for the metric associated with the alarm. Specify a value between p0.0 and p100.

      

  .. py:attribute:: insufficient_data_actions

    

    - *(list) --* 

      The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

      
      

      - *(string) --* 
  

  .. py:attribute:: metric_name

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The name of the metric associated with the alarm, if this is an alarm based on a single metric.

      

  .. py:attribute:: metrics

    

    - *(list) --* 

      An array of MetricDataQuery structures, used in an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each structure either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression. One item in the Metrics array is the math expression that the alarm watches. This expression by designated by having ``ReturnData`` set to true.

      
      

      - *(dict) --* 

        This structure is used in both ``GetMetricData`` and ``PutMetricAlarm`` . The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.

         

        When used in ``GetMetricData`` , it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math expression on metric data. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include up to 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures.

         

        When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each ``MetricDataQuery`` in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single ``PutMetricAlarm`` call can include up to 20 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a ``MetricStat`` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the ``Expression`` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those ``Expression`` structures, one must have ``True`` as the value for ``ReturnData`` . The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.

         

        Any expression used in a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

         

        Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a ``GetMetricData`` operation or a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.

        
        

        - **Id** *(string) --* 

          A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData`` . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.

          
        

        - **MetricStat** *(dict) --* 

          The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data.

           

          Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          
          

          - **Metric** *(dict) --* 

            The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

            
            

            - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

              The namespace of the metric.

              
            

            - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the metric. This is a required field.

              
            

            - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

              The dimensions for the metric.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                
                

                - **Name** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  
            
          
        
          

          - **Period** *(integer) --* 

            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.

             

            If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

             

             
            * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). 
             
            * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). 
             
            * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
             

            
          

          - **Stat** *(string) --* 

            The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.

            
          

          - **Unit** *(string) --* 

            When you are using a ``Put`` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

             

            In a ``Get`` operation, if you omit ``Unit`` then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

            
      
        

        - **Expression** *(string) --* 

          The math expression to be performed on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression. This expression can use the ``Id`` of the other metrics to refer to those metrics, and can also use the ``Id`` of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

           

          Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          
        

        - **Label** *(string) --* 

          A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.

           

          You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see `Using Dynamic Labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`__ .

          
        

        - **ReturnData** *(boolean) --* 

          When used in ``GetMetricData`` , this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify ``False`` . If you omit this, the default of ``True`` is used.

           

          When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , specify ``True`` for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, specify ``ReturnData`` as False.

          
        

        - **Period** *(integer) --* 

          The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` operation that includes a ``StorageResolution of 1 second`` .

  .. py:method:: delete()

    

    Deletes the specified alarms. You can delete up to 100 alarms in one operation. However, this total can include no more than one composite alarm. For example, you could delete 99 metric alarms and one composite alarms with one operation, but you can't delete two composite alarms with one operation.

     

    In the event of an error, no alarms are deleted.

     

    .. note::

       

      It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.

       

      To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the ``AlarmRule`` of one of the alarms to ``False`` . 

       

      Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a cycle in the evaluation path.

    **Request Syntax** 

    ::

      alarm.reload()
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: set_state(**kwargs)

    

    Temporarily sets the state of an alarm for testing purposes. When the updated state differs from the previous value, the action configured for the appropriate state is invoked. For example, if your alarm is configured to send an Amazon SNS message when an alarm is triggered, temporarily changing the alarm state to ``ALARM`` sends an SNS message.

     

    Metric alarms returns to their actual state quickly, often within seconds. Because the metric alarm state change happens quickly, it is typically only visible in the alarm's **History** tab in the Amazon CloudWatch console or through `DescribeAlarmHistory <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAlarmHistory.html>`__ .

     

    If you use ``SetAlarmState`` on a composite alarm, the composite alarm is not guaranteed to return to its actual state. It returns to its actual state only once any of its children alarms change state. It is also reevaluated if you update its configuration.

     

    If an alarm triggers EC2 Auto Scaling policies or application Auto Scaling policies, you must include information in the ``StateReasonData`` parameter to enable the policy to take the correct action.

  Identifiers
  
  Identifiers are properties of a resource that are set upon instantation of the resource.
  For more information about identifiers refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: namespace

    *(string)* The Metric's namespace identifier. This **must** be set.

  .. py:attribute:: name

    *(string)* The Metric's name identifier. This **must** be set.
  .. rst-class:: admonition-title
  
  Attributes
  
  Attributes provide access to the properties of a resource. Attributes are lazy-loaded the first time one is accessed via the :py:meth:`load` method.
  For more information about attributes refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: dimensions

    

    - *(list) --* 

      The dimensions for the metric.

      
      

      - *(dict) --* 

        A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

        
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

          
        

        - **Value** *(string) --* 

          The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

          
    
  

  .. py:attribute:: metric_name

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The name of the metric. This is a required field.

      
  .. rst-class:: admonition-title
  
  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: get_available_subresources()

        
    Returns a list of all the available sub-resources for this
    Resource.
    
    :returns: A list containing the name of each sub-resource for this
        resource
    :rtype: list of str


  .. py:method:: get_statistics(**kwargs)

    

    Gets statistics for the specified metric.

     

    The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are not returned in chronological order.

     

    CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned.

     

    CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:

     

     
    * The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1. 
     
    * The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal. 
     

     

    Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.

     

    Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:

     

     
    * Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a ``StorageResolution`` of 1. 
     
    * Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days. 
     
    * Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days. 
     
    * Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months). 
     

     

    Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.

     

    CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of July 9, 2016.

    :type Dimensions: list
    :param Dimensions: 

      The dimensions. If the metric contains multiple dimensions, you must include a value for each dimension. CloudWatch treats each unique combination of dimensions as a separate metric. If a specific combination of dimensions was not published, you can't retrieve statistics for it. You must specify the same dimensions that were used when the metrics were created. For an example, see `Dimension Combinations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#dimension-combinations>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* . For more information about specifying dimensions, see `Publishing Metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

          The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

    :type StartTime: datetime
    :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The time stamp that determines the first data point to return. Start times are evaluated relative to the time that CloudWatch receives the request.

       

      The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-03T23:00:00Z).

       

      CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:

       

       
      * Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00. 
       
      * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00. 
       
      * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00. 
       

       

      If you set ``Period`` to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or 30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15. 

      

    
    :type EndTime: datetime
    :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The time stamp that determines the last data point to return.

       

      The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to the specified time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-10T23:00:00Z).

      

    
    :type Period: integer
    :param Period: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.

       

      If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

       

       
      * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). 
       
      * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). 
       
      * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
       

      

    
    :type Statistics: list
    :param Statistics: 

      The metric statistics, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ``ExtendedStatistics`` . When calling ``GetMetricStatistics`` , you must specify either ``Statistics`` or ``ExtendedStatistics`` , but not both.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ExtendedStatistics: list
    :param ExtendedStatistics: 

      The percentile statistics. Specify values between p0.0 and p100. When calling ``GetMetricStatistics`` , you must specify either ``Statistics`` or ``ExtendedStatistics`` , but not both. Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Unit: string
    :param Unit: 

      The unit for a given metric. If you omit ``Unit`` , all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

    ::

      metric.load()
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: put_alarm(**kwargs)

    

    Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified metric, metric math expression, or anomaly detection model.

     

    Alarms based on anomaly detection models cannot have Auto Scaling actions.

     

    When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` . The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed.

     

    When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

     

    If you are an IAM user, you must have Amazon EC2 permissions for some alarm operations:

     

     
    * The ``iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`` for all alarms with EC2 actions 
     
    * The ``iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`` to create an alarm with Systems Manager OpsItem actions. 
     

     

    The first time you create an alarm in the AWS Management Console, the CLI, or by using the PutMetricAlarm API, CloudWatch creates the necessary service-linked role for you. The service-linked roles are called ``AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents`` and ``AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchAlarms_ActionSSM`` . For more information, see `AWS service-linked role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role>`__ .

      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Statistic: string
    :param Statistic: 

      The statistic for the metric specified in ``MetricName`` , other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ``ExtendedStatistic`` . When you call ``PutMetricAlarm`` and specify a ``MetricName`` , you must specify either ``Statistic`` or ``ExtendedStatistic,`` but not both.

      

    
    :type ExtendedStatistic: string
    :param ExtendedStatistic: 

      The percentile statistic for the metric specified in ``MetricName`` . Specify a value between p0.0 and p100. When you call ``PutMetricAlarm`` and specify a ``MetricName`` , you must specify either ``Statistic`` or ``ExtendedStatistic,`` but not both.

      

    
    :type Dimensions: list
    :param Dimensions: 

      The dimensions for the metric specified in ``MetricName`` .

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

          

        
      
  
    :type Period: integer
    :param Period: 

      The length, in seconds, used each time the metric specified in ``MetricName`` is evaluated. Valid values are 10, 30, and any multiple of 60.

       

       ``Period`` is required for alarms based on static thresholds. If you are creating an alarm based on a metric math expression, you specify the period for each metric within the objects in the ``Metrics`` array.

       

      Be sure to specify 10 or 30 only for metrics that are stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call with a ``StorageResolution`` of 1. If you specify a period of 10 or 30 for a metric that does not have sub-minute resolution, the alarm still attempts to gather data at the period rate that you specify. In this case, it does not receive data for the attempts that do not correspond to a one-minute data resolution, and the alarm might often lapse into INSUFFICENT_DATA status. Specifying 10 or 30 also sets this alarm as a high-resolution alarm, which has a higher charge than other alarms. For more information about pricing, see `Amazon CloudWatch Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/>`__ .

       

      An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one day, so ``Period`` multiplied by ``EvaluationPeriods`` cannot be more than 86,400 seconds.

      

    
    :type Unit: string
    :param Unit: 

      The unit of measure for the statistic. For example, the units for the Amazon EC2 NetworkIn metric are Bytes because NetworkIn tracks the number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces. You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units help provide conceptual meaning to your data. Metric data points that specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately.

       

      If you don't specify ``Unit`` , CloudWatch retrieves all unit types that have been published for the metric and attempts to evaluate the alarm. Usually, metrics are published with only one unit, so the alarm works as intended.

       

      However, if the metric is published with multiple types of units and you don't specify a unit, the alarm's behavior is not defined and it behaves predictably.

       

      We recommend omitting ``Unit`` so that you don't inadvertently specify an incorrect unit that is not published for this metric. Doing so causes the alarm to be stuck in the ``INSUFFICIENT DATA`` state.

      

    
    :type EvaluationPeriods: integer
    :param EvaluationPeriods: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold. If you are setting an alarm that requires that a number of consecutive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this value specifies that number. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm, this value is the N.

       

      An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one day, so this number multiplied by ``Period`` cannot be more than 86,400 seconds.

      

    
    :type DatapointsToAlarm: integer
    :param DatapointsToAlarm: 

      The number of data points that must be breaching to trigger the alarm. This is used only if you are setting an "M out of N" alarm. In that case, this value is the M. For more information, see `Evaluating an Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarm-evaluation>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

      

    
    :type Threshold: float
    :param Threshold: 

      The value against which the specified statistic is compared.

       

      This parameter is required for alarms based on static thresholds, but should not be used for alarms based on anomaly detection models.

      

    
    :type ComparisonOperator: string
    :param ComparisonOperator: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.

       

      The values ``LessThanLowerOrGreaterThanUpperThreshold`` , ``LessThanLowerThreshold`` , and ``GreaterThanUpperThreshold`` are used only for alarms based on anomaly detection models.

      

    
    :type TreatMissingData: string
    :param TreatMissingData: 

      Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If ``TreatMissingData`` is omitted, the default behavior of ``missing`` is used. For more information, see `Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms Treats Missing Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-missing-data>`__ .

       

      Valid Values: ``breaching | notBreaching | ignore | missing``  

      

    
    :type EvaluateLowSampleCountPercentile: string
    :param EvaluateLowSampleCountPercentile: 

      Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If you specify ``ignore`` , the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If you specify ``evaluate`` or omit this parameter, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available. For more information, see `Percentile-Based CloudWatch Alarms and Low Data Samples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#percentiles-with-low-samples>`__ .

       

      Valid Values: ``evaluate | ignore``  

      

    
    :type Metrics: list
    :param Metrics: 

      An array of ``MetricDataQuery`` structures that enable you to create an alarm based on the result of a metric math expression. For each ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, you must specify either ``MetricName`` or a ``Metrics`` array.

       

      Each item in the ``Metrics`` array either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression.

       

      One item in the ``Metrics`` array is the expression that the alarm watches. You designate this expression by setting ``ReturnData`` to true for this object in the array. For more information, see `MetricDataQuery <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_MetricDataQuery.html>`__ .

       

      If you use the ``Metrics`` parameter, you cannot include the ``MetricName`` , ``Dimensions`` , ``Period`` , ``Namespace`` , ``Statistic`` , or ``ExtendedStatistic`` parameters of ``PutMetricAlarm`` in the same operation. Instead, you retrieve the metrics you are using in your math expression as part of the ``Metrics`` array.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        This structure is used in both ``GetMetricData`` and ``PutMetricAlarm`` . The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.

         

        When used in ``GetMetricData`` , it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math expression on metric data. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include up to 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures.

         

        When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each ``MetricDataQuery`` in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single ``PutMetricAlarm`` call can include up to 20 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a ``MetricStat`` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the ``Expression`` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those ``Expression`` structures, one must have ``True`` as the value for ``ReturnData`` . The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.

         

        Any expression used in a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

         

        Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a ``GetMetricData`` operation or a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.

        

      
        - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData`` . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.

          

        
        - **MetricStat** *(dict) --* 

          The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data.

           

          Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          

        
          - **Metric** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

            

          
            - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

              The namespace of the metric.

              

            
            - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the metric. This is a required field.

              

            
            - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

              The dimensions for the metric.

              

            
              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. 

                

              
                - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  

                
                - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non-ASCII characters.

                  

                
              
          
          
          - **Period** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.

             

            If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

             

             
            * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). 
             
            * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). 
             
            * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
             

            

          
          - **Stat** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.

            

          
          - **Unit** *(string) --* 

            When you are using a ``Put`` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

             

            In a ``Get`` operation, if you omit ``Unit`` then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

            

          
        
        - **Expression** *(string) --* 

          The math expression to be performed on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression. This expression can use the ``Id`` of the other metrics to refer to those metrics, and can also use the ``Id`` of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

           

          Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          

        
        - **Label** *(string) --* 

          A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.

           

          You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see `Using Dynamic Labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`__ .

          

        
        - **ReturnData** *(boolean) --* 

          When used in ``GetMetricData`` , this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify ``False`` . If you omit this, the default of ``True`` is used.

           

          When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , specify ``True`` for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, specify ``ReturnData`` as False.

          

        
        - **Period** *(integer) --* 

          The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` operation that includes a ``StorageResolution of 1 second`` .

          

        
      
  
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      A list of key-value pairs to associate with the alarm. You can associate as many as 50 tags with an alarm.

       

      Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

       

      If you are using this operation to update an existing alarm, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing alarm, use `TagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html>`__ or `UntagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html>`__ .

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A key-value pair associated with a CloudWatch resource.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A string that you can use to assign a value. The combination of tag keys and values can help you organize and categorize your resources.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value for the specified tag key.

          

        
      
  
    :type ThresholdMetricId: string
    :param ThresholdMetricId: 

      If this is an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, make this value match the ID of the ``ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND`` function.

       

      For an example of how to use this parameter, see the **Anomaly Detection Model Alarm** example on this page.

       

      If your alarm uses this parameter, it cannot have Auto Scaling actions.

      

    
    
    :rtype: :py:class:`cloudwatch.Alarm`
    :returns: Alarm resource
    

  .. py:method:: put_data()

    

    Publishes metric data points to Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch associates the data points with the specified metric. If the specified metric does not exist, CloudWatch creates the metric. When CloudWatch creates a metric, it can take up to fifteen minutes for the metric to appear in calls to `ListMetrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_ListMetrics.html>`__ .

     

    You can publish either individual data points in the ``Value`` field, or arrays of values and the number of times each value occurred during the period by using the ``Values`` and ``Counts`` fields in the ``MetricDatum`` structure. Using the ``Values`` and ``Counts`` method enables you to publish up to 150 values per metric with one ``PutMetricData`` request, and supports retrieving percentile statistics on this data.

     

    Each ``PutMetricData`` request is limited to 40 KB in size for HTTP POST requests. You can send a payload compressed by gzip. Each request is also limited to no more than 20 different metrics.

     

    Although the ``Value`` parameter accepts numbers of type ``Double`` , CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of -2^360 to 2^360. In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.

     

    You can use up to 10 dimensions per metric to further clarify what data the metric collects. Each dimension consists of a Name and Value pair. For more information about specifying dimensions, see `Publishing Metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

     

    You specify the time stamp to be associated with each data point. You can specify time stamps that are as much as two weeks before the current date, and as much as 2 hours after the current day and time.

     

    Data points with time stamps from 24 hours ago or longer can take at least 48 hours to become available for `GetMetricData <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html>`__ or `GetMetricStatistics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html>`__ from the time they are submitted. Data points with time stamps between 3 and 24 hours ago can take as much as 2 hours to become available for for `GetMetricData <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html>`__ or `GetMetricStatistics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html>`__ .

     

    CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:

     

     
    * The ``SampleCount`` value of the statistic set is 1 and ``Min`` , ``Max`` , and ``Sum`` are all equal. 
     
    * The ``Min`` and ``Max`` are equal, and ``Sum`` is equal to ``Min`` multiplied by ``SampleCount`` .

      :returns: A list of Alarm resources
      

    .. py:method:: delete()

      

      Deletes the specified alarms. You can delete up to 100 alarms in one operation. However, this total can include no more than one composite alarm. For example, you could delete 99 metric alarms and one composite alarms with one operation, but you can't delete two composite alarms with one operation.

       

      In the event of an error, no alarms are deleted.

       

      .. note::

         

        It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.

         

        To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the ``AlarmRule`` of one of the alarms to ``False`` . 

         

        Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a cycle in the evaluation path.
