  A low-level client representing AWS Global Accelerator
   

  This is the *AWS Global Accelerator API Reference* . This guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the `AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/Welcome.html>`__ .

   

  AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create *accelerators* to improve the performance of your applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits. 

   

   
  * By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network.  
   
  * For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you can use application logic to directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints. 
   

   

  .. warning::

     

    Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple AWS Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create or update accelerators.

     

   

  By default, Global Accelerator provides you with two static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. With a standard accelerator, instead of using the IP addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge network. For a standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple AWS Regions, which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one AWS Region or multiple Regions. For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.

   

  .. warning::

     

    The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you *delete* an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see `Tag-based policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html>`__ .

     

   

  For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is always directed to healthy endpoints.

   

  For a list of the AWS Regions where Global Accelerator and other services are currently supported, see the `AWS Region Table <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/>`__ .

   

  AWS Global Accelerator includes the following components:

    Static IP addresses  

  Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses that are anycast from the AWS edge network. If you bring your own IP address range to AWS (BYOIP) to use with a standard accelerator, you can instead assign IP addresses from your own pool to use with your accelerator. For more information, see `Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in AWS Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/using-byoip.html>`__ .

   

  The IP addresses serve as single fixed entry points for your clients. If you already have Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP address resources set up for your applications, you can easily add those to a standard accelerator in Global Accelerator. This allows Global Accelerator to use static IP addresses to access the resources.

   

  The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you *delete* an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to delete an accelerator. For more information, see `Tag-based policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html>`__ .

    Accelerator  

  An accelerator directs traffic to endpoints over the AWS global network to improve the performance of your internet applications. Each accelerator includes one or more listeners.

   

  There are two types of accelerators:

   

   
  * A *standard* accelerator directs traffic to the optimal AWS endpoint based on several factors, including the user’s location, the health of the endpoint, and the endpoint weights that you configure. This improves the availability and performance of your applications. Endpoints can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses. 
   
  * A *custom routing* accelerator directs traffic to one of possibly thousands of Amazon EC2 instances running in a single or multiple virtual private clouds (VPCs). With custom routing, listener ports are mapped to statically associate port ranges with VPC subnets, which allows Global Accelerator to determine an EC2 instance IP address at the time of connection. By default, all port mapping destinations in a VPC subnet can't receive traffic. You can choose to configure all destinations in the subnet to receive traffic, or to specify individual port mappings that can receive traffic. 
   

   

  For more information, see `Types of accelerators <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/introduction-accelerator-types.html>`__ .

    DNS name  

  Global Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default Domain Name System (DNS) name, similar to ``a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com`` , that points to the static IP addresses that Global Accelerator assigns to you or that you choose from your own IP address range. Depending on the use case, you can use your accelerator's static IP addresses or DNS name to route traffic to your accelerator, or set up DNS records to route traffic using your own custom domain name.

    Network zone  

  A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network zone is an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP address from a network zone becomes unavailable due to IP address blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, then client applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated network zone.

    Listener  

  A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator, based on the port (or port range) and protocol (or protocols) that you configure. A listener can be configured for TCP, UDP, or both TCP and UDP protocols. Each listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded to endpoints in one of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you want to distribute traffic to. With a standard accelerator, traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints within the endpoint groups associated with a listener.

    Endpoint group  

  Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups include one or more endpoints in the Region. With a standard accelerator, you can increase or reduce the percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group by adjusting a setting called a *traffic dial* . The traffic dial lets you easily do performance testing or blue/green deployment testing, for example, for new releases across different AWS Regions. 

    Endpoint  

  An endpoint is a resource that Global Accelerator directs traffic to.

   

  Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses. An Application Load Balancer endpoint can be internet-facing or internal. Traffic for standard accelerators is routed to endpoints based on the health of the endpoint along with configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers that you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for example, to do performance testing within a Region.

   

  Endpoints for custom routing accelerators are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets with one or many EC2 instances.

  .. py:method:: add_custom_routing_endpoints(**kwargs)

    

    Associate a virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet endpoint with your custom routing accelerator.

     

    The listener port range must be large enough to support the number of IP addresses that can be specified in your subnet. The number of ports required is: subnet size times the number of ports per destination EC2 instances. For example, a subnet defined as /24 requires a listener port range of at least 255 ports. 

     

    Note: You must have enough remaining listener ports available to map to the subnet ports, or the call will fail with a LimitExceededException.

     

    By default, all destinations in a subnet in a custom routing accelerator cannot receive traffic. To enable all destinations to receive traffic, or to specify individual port mappings that can receive traffic, see the `AllowCustomRoutingTraffic <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_AllowCustomRoutingTraffic.html>`__ operation.

        - **EndpointId** *(string) --* 

          An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID. A resource must be valid and active when you add it as an endpoint.

           

          An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or internet-facing.

          

        
        - **Weight** *(integer) --* 

          The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see `Endpoint Weights <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoints-endpoint-weights.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

          Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application Load Balancer endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for new accelerators. 

           

          If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the ``X-Forwarded-For`` request header as traffic travels to applications on the Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.

           

          For more information, see `Preserve Client IP Addresses in AWS Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/preserve-client-ip-address.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

          

        
      
  
    :type TrafficDialPercentage: float
    :param TrafficDialPercentage:

      Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been routed to the Region based on optimal routing.

       

      The default value is 100.

      

    
    :type HealthCheckPort: integer
    :param HealthCheckPort: 

      The port that AWS Global Accelerator uses to check the health of endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default port is the listener port that this endpoint group is associated with. If listener port is a list of ports, Global Accelerator uses the first port in the list.

      

    
    :type HealthCheckProtocol: string
    :param HealthCheckProtocol: 

      The protocol that AWS Global Accelerator uses to check the health of endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.

      

    
    :type HealthCheckPath: string
    :param HealthCheckPath: 

      If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this specifies the path that is the destination for health check targets. The default value is slash (/).

      

    
    :type HealthCheckIntervalSeconds: integer
    :param HealthCheckIntervalSeconds: 

      The time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between each health check for an endpoint. The default value is 30.

      

    
    :type ThresholdCount: integer
    :param ThresholdCount: 

      The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.

      

    
    :type IdempotencyToken: string
    :param IdempotencyToken: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency—that is, the uniqueness—of the request.

    :type PortOverrides: list
    :param PortOverrides: 

      Override specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. For example, you can create a port override in which the listener receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.

       

      For more information, see `Port overrides <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoint-groups-port-override.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

        - **ListenerPort** *(integer) --* 

          The listener port that you want to map to a specific endpoint port. This is the port that user traffic arrives to the Global Accelerator on.

          

        
        - **EndpointPort** *(integer) --* 

          The endpoint port that you want a listener port to be mapped to. This is the port on the endpoint, such as the Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.

                For more information, see `Viewing Client IP Addresses in AWS Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/introduction-how-it-works-client-ip.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

                
          
        
          

          - **TrafficDialPercentage** *(float) --* 

            The percentage of traffic to send to an AWS Region. Additional traffic is distributed to other endpoint groups for this listener. 

             

            Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been routed to the Region based on optimal routing.

             

            The default value is 100.

            
          

          - **HealthCheckPort** *(integer) --* 

            The port that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. 

             

            The default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint group is associated with. If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified port in the list of ports.

            
          

          - **HealthCheckProtocol** *(string) --* 

            The protocol that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.

            
          

          - **HealthCheckPath** *(string) --* 

            If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping path that Global Accelerator uses for the destination on the endpoints for health checks. The default is slash (/).

            
          

          - **HealthCheckIntervalSeconds** *(integer) --* 

            The time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between health checks for each endpoint. The default value is 30.

            
          

          - **ThresholdCount** *(integer) --* 

            The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.

            
          

          - **PortOverrides** *(list) --* 

            Allows you to override the destination ports used to route traffic to an endpoint. Using a port override lets you to map a list of external destination ports (that your users send traffic to) to a list of internal destination ports that you want an application endpoint to receive traffic on. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Override specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints that are part of an endpoint group. For example, you can create a port override in which the listener receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.

               

              For more information, see `Port overrides <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoint-groups-port-override.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

              
              

              - **ListenerPort** *(integer) --* 

                The listener port that you want to map to a specific endpoint port. This is the port that user traffic arrives to the Global Accelerator on.

                
              

              - **EndpointPort** *(integer) --* 

                The endpoint port that you want a listener port to be mapped to. This is the port on the endpoint, such as the Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.

    :type ClientAffinity: string
    :param ClientAffinity: 

      Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client request. Client affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific endpoint.

       

      AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is ``NONE`` , Global Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes. 

       

      If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to ``SOURCE_IP`` instead. When you use the ``SOURCE_IP`` setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address and destination IP address—to select the hash value.

       

      The default value is ``NONE`` .

  .. py:method:: delete_accelerator(**kwargs)

    

    Delete an accelerator. Before you can delete an accelerator, you must disable it and remove all dependent resources (listeners and endpoint groups). To disable the accelerator, update the accelerator to set ``Enabled`` to false.

     

    .. warning::

       

      When you create an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses. Alternatively, you can bring your own IP address ranges to Global Accelerator and assign IP addresses from those ranges. 

       

      The IP addresses are assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you *delete* an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to the accelerator, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. As a best practice, ensure that you have permissions in place to avoid inadvertently deleting accelerators. You can use IAM policies with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator.

  .. py:method:: deprovision_byoip_cidr(**kwargs)

    

    Releases the specified address range that you provisioned to use with your AWS resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) and deletes the corresponding address pool. 

     

    Before you can release an address range, you must stop advertising it by using `WithdrawByoipCidr <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/WithdrawByoipCidr.html>`__ and you must not have any accelerators that are using static IP addresses allocated from its address range. 

     

    For more information, see `Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/using-byoip.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

          The description of an endpoint group.

          
          

          - **EndpointGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

            - *(dict) --* 

              A complex type for an endpoint. Each endpoint group can include one or more endpoints, such as load balancers.

              
              

              - **EndpointId** *(string) --* 

                An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID. 

                 

                An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or internet-facing.

                
              

              - **Weight** *(integer) --* 

                The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see `Endpoint Weights <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoints-endpoint-weights.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* . 

                
              

              - **HealthState** *(string) --* 

                The health status of the endpoint.

                
              

              - **HealthReason** *(string) --* 

                Returns a null result.

                
              

              - **ClientIPPreservationEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

                Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application Load Balancer endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for new accelerators. 

                 

                If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the ``X-Forwarded-For`` request header as traffic travels to applications on the Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.

                 

                For more information, see `Viewing Client IP Addresses in AWS Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/introduction-how-it-works-client-ip.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

                
          
        
          

          - **TrafficDialPercentage** *(float) --* 

            The percentage of traffic to send to an AWS Region. Additional traffic is distributed to other endpoint groups for this listener. 

             

            Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been routed to the Region based on optimal routing.

             

            The default value is 100.

            
          

          - **HealthCheckPort** *(integer) --* 

            The port that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. 

             

            The default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint group is associated with. If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified port in the list of ports.

            
          

          - **HealthCheckProtocol** *(string) --* 

            The protocol that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.

            
          

          - **HealthCheckPath** *(string) --* 

            If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping path that Global Accelerator uses for the destination on the endpoints for health checks. The default is slash (/).

            
          

          - **HealthCheckIntervalSeconds** *(integer) --* 

            The time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between health checks for each endpoint. The default value is 30.

            
          

          - **ThresholdCount** *(integer) --* 

            The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.

            
          

          - **PortOverrides** *(list) --* 

            Allows you to override the destination ports used to route traffic to an endpoint. Using a port override lets you to map a list of external destination ports (that your users send traffic to) to a list of internal destination ports that you want an application endpoint to receive traffic on. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Override specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints that are part of an endpoint group. For example, you can create a port override in which the listener receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.

               

              For more information, see `Port overrides <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoint-groups-port-override.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

              
              

              - **ListenerPort** *(integer) --* 

                The listener port that you want to map to a specific endpoint port. This is the port that user traffic arrives to the Global Accelerator on.

                
              

              - **EndpointPort** *(integer) --* 

                The endpoint port that you want a listener port to be mapped to. This is the port on the endpoint, such as the Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.

          - **ClientAffinity** *(string) --* 

            Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client request. Client affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific endpoint.

             

            AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is ``NONE`` , Global Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes. 

             

            If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to ``SOURCE_IP`` instead. When you use the ``SOURCE_IP`` setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address and destination IP address—to select the hash value.

             

            The default value is ``NONE`` .

  .. py:method:: list_custom_routing_port_mappings(**kwargs)

    

    Provides a complete mapping from the public accelerator IP address and port to destination EC2 instance IP addresses and ports in the virtual public cloud (VPC) subnet endpoint for a custom routing accelerator. For each subnet endpoint that you add, Global Accelerator creates a new static port mapping for the accelerator. The port mappings don't change after Global Accelerator generates them, so you can retrieve and cache the full mapping on your servers. 

     

    If you remove a subnet from your accelerator, Global Accelerator removes (reclaims) the port mappings. If you add a subnet to your accelerator, Global Accelerator creates new port mappings (the existing ones don't change). If you add or remove EC2 instances in your subnet, the port mappings don't change, because the mappings are created when you add the subnet to Global Accelerator.

     

    The mappings also include a flag for each destination denoting which destination IP addresses and ports are allowed or denied traffic.

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **EndpointGroups** *(list) --* 

          The list of the endpoint groups associated with a listener.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A complex type for the endpoint group. An AWS Region can have only one endpoint group for a specific listener. 

            
            

            - **EndpointGroupArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

              
            

            - **EndpointGroupRegion** *(string) --* 

              The AWS Region where the endpoint group is located.

              
            

            - **EndpointDescriptions** *(list) --* 

              The list of endpoint objects.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A complex type for an endpoint. Each endpoint group can include one or more endpoints, such as load balancers.

                
                

                - **EndpointId** *(string) --* 

                  An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID. 

                   

                  An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or internet-facing.

                  
                

                - **Weight** *(integer) --* 

                  The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see `Endpoint Weights <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoints-endpoint-weights.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* . 

                  
                

                - **HealthState** *(string) --* 

                  The health status of the endpoint.

                  
                

                - **HealthReason** *(string) --* 

                  Returns a null result.

                  
                

                - **ClientIPPreservationEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

                  Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application Load Balancer endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for new accelerators. 

                   

                  If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the ``X-Forwarded-For`` request header as traffic travels to applications on the Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.

                   

                  For more information, see `Viewing Client IP Addresses in AWS Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/introduction-how-it-works-client-ip.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

                  
            
          
            

            - **TrafficDialPercentage** *(float) --* 

              The percentage of traffic to send to an AWS Region. Additional traffic is distributed to other endpoint groups for this listener. 

               

              Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been routed to the Region based on optimal routing.

               

              The default value is 100.

              
            

            - **HealthCheckPort** *(integer) --* 

              The port that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. 

               

              The default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint group is associated with. If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified port in the list of ports.

              
            

            - **HealthCheckProtocol** *(string) --* 

              The protocol that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.

              
            

            - **HealthCheckPath** *(string) --* 

              If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping path that Global Accelerator uses for the destination on the endpoints for health checks. The default is slash (/).

              
            

            - **HealthCheckIntervalSeconds** *(integer) --* 

              The time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between health checks for each endpoint. The default value is 30.

              
            

            - **ThresholdCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.

              
            

            - **PortOverrides** *(list) --* 

              Allows you to override the destination ports used to route traffic to an endpoint. Using a port override lets you to map a list of external destination ports (that your users send traffic to) to a list of internal destination ports that you want an application endpoint to receive traffic on. 

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Override specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints that are part of an endpoint group. For example, you can create a port override in which the listener receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.

                 

                For more information, see `Port overrides <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoint-groups-port-override.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

                
                

                - **ListenerPort** *(integer) --* 

                  The listener port that you want to map to a specific endpoint port. This is the port that user traffic arrives to the Global Accelerator on.

                  
                

                - **EndpointPort** *(integer) --* 

                  The endpoint port that you want a listener port to be mapped to. This is the port on the endpoint, such as the Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.

            - **ClientAffinity** *(string) --* 

              Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client request. Client affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific endpoint.

               

              AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is ``NONE`` , Global Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes. 

               

              If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to ``SOURCE_IP`` instead. When you use the ``SOURCE_IP`` setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address and destination IP address—to select the hash value.

               

              The default value is ``NONE`` .

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a previous call.

For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see `Endpoint Weights <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoints-endpoint-weights.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

          

        
        - **ClientIPPreservationEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application Load Balancer endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for new accelerators. 

           

          If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the ``X-Forwarded-For`` request header as traffic travels to applications on the Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.

      Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been routed to the Region based on optimal routing.

       

      The default value is 100.

      

    
    :type HealthCheckPort: integer
    :param HealthCheckPort:

    :type ThresholdCount: integer
    :param ThresholdCount: 

      The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.

      

    
    :type PortOverrides: list

      Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client request. Client affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific endpoint.

       

      AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is ``NONE`` , Global Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes. 

       

      If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to ``SOURCE_IP`` instead. When you use the ``SOURCE_IP`` setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address and destination IP address—to select the hash value.

       

      The default value is ``NONE`` .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **EndpointGroups** *(list) --* 

          The list of the endpoint groups associated with a listener.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A complex type for the endpoint group. An AWS Region can have only one endpoint group for a specific listener. 

            
            

            - **EndpointGroupArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

              
            

            - **EndpointGroupRegion** *(string) --* 

              The AWS Region where the endpoint group is located.

              
            

            - **EndpointDescriptions** *(list) --* 

              The list of endpoint objects.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A complex type for an endpoint. Each endpoint group can include one or more endpoints, such as load balancers.

                
                

                - **EndpointId** *(string) --* 

                  An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID. 

                   

                  An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or internet-facing.

                  
                

                - **Weight** *(integer) --* 

                  The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see `Endpoint Weights <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoints-endpoint-weights.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* . 

                  
                

                - **HealthState** *(string) --* 

                  The health status of the endpoint.

                  
                

                - **HealthReason** *(string) --* 

                  Returns a null result.

                  
                

                - **ClientIPPreservationEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

                  Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application Load Balancer endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for new accelerators. 

                   

                  If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the ``X-Forwarded-For`` request header as traffic travels to applications on the Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.

                   

                  For more information, see `Viewing Client IP Addresses in AWS Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/introduction-how-it-works-client-ip.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

                  
            
          
            

            - **TrafficDialPercentage** *(float) --* 

              The percentage of traffic to send to an AWS Region. Additional traffic is distributed to other endpoint groups for this listener. 

               

              Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been routed to the Region based on optimal routing.

               

              The default value is 100.

              
            

            - **HealthCheckPort** *(integer) --* 

              The port that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. 

               

              The default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint group is associated with. If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified port in the list of ports.

              
            

            - **HealthCheckProtocol** *(string) --* 

              The protocol that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.

              
            

            - **HealthCheckPath** *(string) --* 

              If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping path that Global Accelerator uses for the destination on the endpoints for health checks. The default is slash (/).

              
            

            - **HealthCheckIntervalSeconds** *(integer) --* 

              The time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between health checks for each endpoint. The default value is 30.

              
            

            - **ThresholdCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.

              
            

            - **PortOverrides** *(list) --* 

              Allows you to override the destination ports used to route traffic to an endpoint. Using a port override lets you to map a list of external destination ports (that your users send traffic to) to a list of internal destination ports that you want an application endpoint to receive traffic on. 

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Override specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints that are part of an endpoint group. For example, you can create a port override in which the listener receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.

                 

                For more information, see `Port overrides <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoint-groups-port-override.html>`__ in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

                
                

                - **ListenerPort** *(integer) --* 

                  The listener port that you want to map to a specific endpoint port. This is the port that user traffic arrives to the Global Accelerator on.

                  
                

                - **EndpointPort** *(integer) --* 

                  The endpoint port that you want a listener port to be mapped to. This is the port on the endpoint, such as the Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.

                A complex type for a range of ports for a listener.

                
                

                - **FromPort** *(integer) --*

            - **Protocol** *(string) --* 

              The protocol for the connections from clients to the accelerator.

              
            

            - **ClientAffinity** *(string) --* 

              Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client request. Client affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific endpoint.

               

              AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is ``NONE`` , Global Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes. 

               

              If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to ``SOURCE_IP`` instead. When you use the ``SOURCE_IP`` setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address and destination IP address—to select the hash value.

               

              The default value is ``NONE`` .
