.. py:class:: Glacier.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon Glacier
  

  Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) is a storage solution for "cold data."

   

  Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Glacier also enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.

   

  Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount and your data is rarely retrieved. If your application requires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, see `Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) <http://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`__ .

   

  You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data you can store in Glacier.

   

  If you are a first-time user of Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections in the *Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide* :

   

   
  * `What is Amazon S3 Glacier <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html>`__ - This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying data model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with the service. 
   
  * `Getting Started with Amazon S3 Glacier <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html>`__ - The Getting Started section walks you through the process of creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download archives, retrieving the job output, and deleting archives.

  .. py:method:: abort_multipart_upload(**kwargs)

    

    This operation aborts a multipart upload identified by the upload ID.

     

    After the Abort Multipart Upload request succeeds, you cannot upload any more parts to the multipart upload or complete the multipart upload. Aborting a completed upload fails. However, aborting an already-aborted upload will succeed, for a short time. For more information about uploading a part and completing a multipart upload, see  UploadMultipartPart and  CompleteMultipartUpload .

     

    This operation is idempotent.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html>`__ .

     

    For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see `Working with Archives in Amazon S3 Glacier <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/working-with-archives.html>`__ and `Abort Multipart Upload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-multipart-abort-upload.html>`__ in the *Amazon Glacier Developer Guide* . 

    

    See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/glacier-2012-06-01/AbortMultipartUpload>`_    


    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.abort_multipart_upload(
          vaultName='string',
          uploadId='string'
      )
    :type accountId: string
    :param accountId: 

      The ``AccountId`` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '``-`` ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

            Note: this parameter is set to "-" bydefault if no value is not specified.


    
    :type vaultName: string
    :param vaultName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the vault.

      

    
    :type uploadId: string
    :param uploadId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The upload ID of the multipart upload to delete.

      

    
    
    :returns: None
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`Glacier.Client.exceptions.ResourceNotFoundException`

    
    *     :py:class:`Glacier.Client.exceptions.InvalidParameterValueException`

    
    *     :py:class:`Glacier.Client.exceptions.MissingParameterValueException`

    
    *     :py:class:`Glacier.Client.exceptions.ServiceUnavailableException`

    

    **Examples** 

    The example deletes an in-progress multipart upload to a vault named my-vault:
    ::

      response = client.abort_multipart_upload(
          accountId='-',
          uploadId='19gaRezEXAMPLES6Ry5YYdqthHOC_kGRCT03L9yetr220UmPtBYKk-OssZtLqyFu7sY1_lR7vgFuJV6NtcV5zpsJ',
          vaultName='my-vault',
      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

      {
          'ResponseMetadata': {
              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: abort_vault_lock(**kwargs)

    

    This operation aborts the vault locking process if the vault lock is not in the ``Locked`` state. If the vault lock is in the ``Locked`` state when this operation is requested, the operation returns an ``AccessDeniedException`` error. Aborting the vault locking process removes the vault lock policy from the specified vault. 

     

    A vault lock is put into the ``InProgress`` state by calling  InitiateVaultLock . A vault lock is put into the ``Locked`` state by calling  CompleteVaultLock . You can get the state of a vault lock by calling  GetVaultLock . For more information about the vault locking process, see `Amazon Glacier Vault Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock.html>`__ . For more information about vault lock policies, see `Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock-policy.html>`__ . 

     

    This operation is idempotent. You can successfully invoke this operation multiple times, if the vault lock is in the ``InProgress`` state or if there is no policy associated with the vault.

      response = client.abort_vault_lock(
          vaultName='string'
      )
    :type accountId: string
    :param accountId: 

      The ``AccountId`` value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '``-`` ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

            Note: this parameter is set to "-" bydefault if no value is not specified.

    **Examples** 

    The example aborts the vault locking process if the vault lock is not in the Locked state for the vault named examplevault.
    ::

      response = client.abort_vault_lock(
          accountId='-',
          vaultName='examplevault',
      )

          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: add_tags_to_vault(**kwargs)

    

    This operation adds the specified tags to a vault. Each tag is composed of a key and a value. Each vault can have up to 10 tags. If your request would cause the tag limit for the vault to be exceeded, the operation throws the ``LimitExceededException`` error. If a tag already exists on the vault under a specified key, the existing key value will be overwritten. For more information about tags, see `Tagging Amazon S3 Glacier Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/tagging.html>`__ .

    **Examples** 

    The example adds two tags to a my-vault.
    ::

      response = client.add_tags_to_vault(
          Tags={
              'examplekey1': 'examplevalue1',
              'examplekey2': 'examplevalue2',
          },
          accountId='-',
          vaultName='my-vault',
      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: complete_multipart_upload(**kwargs)

    

    You call this operation to inform Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) that all the archive parts have been uploaded and that Glacier can now assemble the archive from the uploaded parts. After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see  InitiateJob .

     

    In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see `Computing Checksums <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`__ . On the server side, Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Glacier saves the archive to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The  ListParts operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue.

     

    Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Glacier returns an error and the operation fails.

     

    Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

          archiveSize='string',
          checksum='string'
      )
    :type accountId: string
    :param accountId: 

      The ``AccountId`` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '``-`` ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

            Note: this parameter is set to "-" bydefault if no value is not specified.


    
    :type vaultName: string
    :param vaultName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the vault.

      

    
    :type uploadId: string
    :param uploadId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The upload ID of the multipart upload.

      

    
    :type archiveSize: string
    :param archiveSize: 

      The total size, in bytes, of the entire archive. This value should be the sum of all the sizes of the individual parts that you uploaded.

      

    
    :type checksum: string
    :param checksum: 

      The SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive. It is the tree hash of SHA256 tree hash of the individual parts. If the value you specify in the request does not match the SHA256 tree hash of the final assembled archive as computed by Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier), Glacier returns an error and the request fails.

            
        This is a required field.

        Ideally you will want to compute this value with checksums from
        previous uploaded parts, using the algorithm described in
        `Glacier documentation <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`_.

        But if you prefer, you can also use botocore.utils.calculate_tree_hash()
        to compute it from raw file by::

            checksum = calculate_tree_hash(open('your_file.txt', 'rb'))

  .. py:method:: complete_vault_lock(**kwargs)

    

    This operation completes the vault locking process by transitioning the vault lock from the ``InProgress`` state to the ``Locked`` state, which causes the vault lock policy to become unchangeable. A vault lock is put into the ``InProgress`` state by calling  InitiateVaultLock . You can obtain the state of the vault lock by calling  GetVaultLock . For more information about the vault locking process, `Amazon Glacier Vault Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock.html>`__ . 

     

    This operation is idempotent. This request is always successful if the vault lock is in the ``Locked`` state and the provided lock ID matches the lock ID originally used to lock the vault.

     

    If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the ``Locked`` state, the operation returns an ``AccessDeniedException`` error. If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the ``InProgress`` state, the operation throws an ``InvalidParameter`` error.

          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: create_vault(**kwargs)

    

    This operation creates a new vault with the specified name. The name of the vault must be unique within a region for an AWS account. You can create up to 1,000 vaults per account. If you need to create more vaults, contact Amazon S3 Glacier.

     

    You must use the following guidelines when naming a vault.

     

     
    * Names can be between 1 and 255 characters long. 
     
    * Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), and '.' (period). 
     

     

    This operation is idempotent.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: delete_archive(**kwargs)

    

    This operation deletes an archive from a vault. Subsequent requests to initiate a retrieval of this archive will fail. Archive retrievals that are in progress for this archive ID may or may not succeed according to the following scenarios:

     

     
    * If the archive retrieval job is actively preparing the data for download when Amazon S3 Glacier receives the delete archive request, the archival retrieval operation might fail. 
     
    * If the archive retrieval job has successfully prepared the archive for download when Amazon S3 Glacier receives the delete archive request, you will be able to download the output. 
     

     

    This operation is idempotent. Attempting to delete an already-deleted archive does not result in an error.

  .. py:method:: delete_vault(**kwargs)

    

    This operation deletes a vault. Amazon S3 Glacier will delete a vault only if there are no archives in the vault as of the last inventory and there have been no writes to the vault since the last inventory. If either of these conditions is not satisfied, the vault deletion fails (that is, the vault is not removed) and Amazon S3 Glacier returns an error. You can use  DescribeVault to return the number of archives in a vault, and you can use `Initiate a Job (POST jobs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-initiate-job-post.html>`__ to initiate a new inventory retrieval for a vault. The inventory contains the archive IDs you use to delete archives using `Delete Archive (DELETE archive) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-delete.html>`__ .

      This operation enables you to check the status of your job. However, it is strongly recommended that you set up an Amazon SNS topic and specify it in your initiate job request so that Glacier can notify the topic after it completes the job.

  .. py:method:: describe_vault(**kwargs)

    

    This operation returns information about a vault, including the vault's Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the date the vault was created, the number of archives it contains, and the total size of all the archives in the vault. The number of archives and their total size are as of the last inventory generation. This means that if you add or remove an archive from a vault, and then immediately use Describe Vault, the change in contents will not be immediately reflected. If you want to retrieve the latest inventory of the vault, use  InitiateJob . Amazon S3 Glacier generates vault inventories approximately daily. For more information, see `Downloading a Vault Inventory in Amazon S3 Glacier <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-inventory.html>`__ . 

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default.

  .. py:method:: get_job_output(**kwargs)

    

    This operation downloads the output of the job you initiated using  InitiateJob . Depending on the job type you specified when you initiated the job, the output will be either the content of an archive or a vault inventory.

     

    You can download all the job output or download a portion of the output by specifying a byte range. In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) returns the checksum for the portion of the data. You can compute the checksum on the client and verify that the values match to ensure the portion you downloaded is the correct data.

     

    A job ID will not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier completes the job. That a byte range. For both archive and inventory retrieval jobs, you should verify the downloaded size against the size returned in the headers from the **Get Job Output** response.

     

    For archive retrieval jobs, you should also verify that the size is what you expected. If you download a portion of the output, the expected size is based on the range of bytes you specified. For example, if you specify a range of ``bytes=0-1048575`` , you should verify your download size is 1,048,576 bytes. If you download an entire archive, the expected size is the size of the archive when you uploaded it to Amazon S3 Glacier The expected size is also returned in the headers from the **Get Job Output** response.

     

    In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify, Glacier returns the checksum for the portion of the data. To ensure the portion you downloaded is the correct data, compute the checksum on the client, verify that the values match, and verify that the size is what you expected.

     

    A job ID does not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier completes the job. That is, you can download the job output within the 24 hours period after Amazon Glacier completes the job.

      The ``AccountId`` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '``-`` ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.

            Note: this parameter is set to "-" bydefault if no value is not specified.


    
    :type vaultName: string
    :param vaultName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the vault.

      

    
    :type jobId: string
    :param jobId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The job ID whose data is downloaded.

      

    
    :type range: string
    :param range: 

      The range of bytes to retrieve from the output. For example, if you want to download the first 1,048,576 bytes, specify the range as ``bytes=0-1048575`` . By default, this operation downloads the entire output.

       

      If the job output is large, then you can use a range to retrieve a portion of the output. This allows you to download the entire output in smaller chunks of bytes. For example, suppose you have 1 GB of job output you want to download and you decide to download 128 MB chunks of data at a time, which is a total of eight Get Job Output requests. You use the following process to download the job output:

       

       
      * Download a 128 MB chunk of output by specifying the appropriate byte range. Verify that all 128 MB of data was received. 
       
      * Along with the data, the response includes a SHA256 tree hash of the payload. You compute the checksum of the payload on the client and compare it with the checksum you received in the response to ensure you received all the expected data. 
       
      * Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all the eight 128 MB chunks of output data, each time specifying the appropriate byte range. 
       
      * After downloading all the parts of the job output, you have a list of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these values to find the checksum of the entire output. Using the  DescribeJob API, obtain job information of the job that provided you the output. The response includes the checksum of the entire archive stored in Amazon S3 Glacier. You compare this value with the checksum you computed to ensure you have downloaded the entire archive content with no errors.

        - **checksum** *(string) --* 

          The checksum of the data in the response. This header is returned only when retrieving the output for an archive retrieval job. Furthermore, this header appears only under the following conditions:

           

           
          * You get the entire range of the archive. 
           
          * You request a range to return of the archive that starts and ends on a multiple of 1 MB. For example, if you have an 3.1 MB archive and you specify a range to return that starts at 1 MB and ends at 2 MB, then the x-amz-sha256-tree-hash is returned as a response header. 
           
          * You request a range of the archive to return that starts on a multiple of 1 MB and goes to the end of the archive. For example, if you have a 3.1 MB archive and you specify a range that starts at 2 MB and ends at 3.1 MB (the end of the archive), then the x-amz-sha256-tree-hash is returned as a response header.

        - **contentRange** *(string) --* 

          The range of bytes returned by Amazon S3 Glacier. If only partial output is downloaded, the response provides the range of bytes Amazon S3 Glacier returned. For example, bytes 0-1048575/8388608 returns the first 1 MB from 8 MB.

          
        

        - **acceptRanges** *(string) --* 

          Indicates the range units accepted. For more information, see `RFC2616 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html>`__ . 

          
        

        - **contentType** *(string) --* 

          The Content-Type depends on whether the job output is an archive or a vault inventory. For archive data, the Content-Type is application/octet-stream. For vault inventory, if you requested CSV format when you initiated the job, the Content-Type is text/csv. Otherwise, by default, vault inventory is returned as JSON, and the Content-Type is application/json.

          
        

        - **archiveDescription** *(string) --* 

          The description of an archive.

  .. py:method:: get_vault_lock(**kwargs)

    

    This operation retrieves the following attributes from the ``lock-policy`` subresource set on the specified vault: 

     

     
    * The vault lock policy set on the vault. 
     
    * The state of the vault lock, which is either ``InProgess`` or ``Locked`` . 
     
    * When the lock ID expires. The lock ID is used to complete the vault locking process. 
     
    * When the vault lock was initiated and put into the ``InProgress`` state. 
     

     

    A vault lock is put into the ``InProgress`` state by calling  InitiateVaultLock . A vault lock is put into the ``Locked`` state by calling  CompleteVaultLock . You can abort the vault locking process by calling  AbortVaultLock . For more information about the vault locking process, `Amazon Glacier Vault Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock.html>`__ . 

     

    If there is no vault lock policy set on the vault, the operation returns a ``404 Not found`` error. For more information about vault lock policies, `Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock-policy.html>`__ .

      - **Format** *(string) --* 

        When initiating a job to retrieve a vault inventory, you can optionally add this parameter to your request to specify the output format. If you are initiating an inventory job and do not specify a Format field, JSON is the default format. Valid values are "CSV" and "JSON".

        

      
      - **Type** *(string) --* 

        The job type. You can initiate a job to perform a select query on an archive, retrieve an archive, or get an inventory of a vault. Valid values are "select", "archive-retrieval" and "inventory-retrieval".

        

      
      - **ArchiveId** *(string) --* 

        The ID of the archive that you want to retrieve. This field is required only if ``Type`` is set to ``select`` or ``archive-retrieval`` code>. An error occurs if you specify this request parameter for an inventory retrieval job request. 

        

      
      - **Description** *(string) --* 

        The optional description for the job. The description must be less than or equal to 1,024 bytes. The allowable characters are 7-bit ASCII without control codes-specifically, ASCII values 32-126 decimal or 0x20-0x7E hexadecimal.

        

      
      - **SNSTopic** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon SNS topic ARN to which Amazon S3 Glacier sends a notification when the job is completed and the output is ready for you to download. The specified topic publishes the notification to its subscribers. The SNS topic must exist.

        

      
      - **RetrievalByteRange** *(string) --* 

        The byte range to retrieve for an archive retrieval. in the form "*StartByteValue* -*EndByteValue* " If not specified, the whole archive is retrieved. If specified, the byte range must be megabyte (1024*1024) aligned which means that *StartByteValue* must be divisible by 1 MB and *EndByteValue* plus 1 must be divisible by 1 MB or be the end of the archive specified as the archive byte size value minus 1. If RetrievalByteRange is not megabyte aligned, this operation returns a 400 response. 

         

        An error occurs if you specify this field for an inventory retrieval job request.

        

      
      - **Tier** *(string) --*

  .. py:method:: initiate_multipart_upload(**kwargs)

    

    This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon S3 Glacier creates a multipart upload resource and returns its ID in the response. The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of an archive (see  UploadMultipartPart ).

     

    When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB.

     

    Every part you upload to this resource (see  UploadMultipartPart ), except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB. 

     

    .. note::

       

      You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because Amazon S3 Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size.

       

     

    After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Glacier also removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart upload or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24 hours.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

  .. py:method:: initiate_vault_lock(**kwargs)

    

    This operation initiates the vault locking process by doing the following:

     

     
    * Installing a vault lock policy on the specified vault. 
     
    * Setting the lock state of vault lock to ``InProgress`` . 
     
    * Returning a lock ID, which is used to complete the vault locking process. 
     

     

    You can set one vault lock policy for each vault and this policy can be up to 20 KB in size. For more information about vault lock policies, see `Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock-policy.html>`__ . 

     

    You must complete the vault locking process within 24 hours after the vault lock enters the ``InProgress`` state. After the 24 hour window ends, the lock ID expires, the vault automatically exits the ``InProgress`` state, and the vault lock policy is removed from the vault. You call  CompleteVaultLock to complete the vault locking process by setting the state of the vault lock to ``Locked`` . 

     

    After a vault lock is in the ``Locked`` state, you cannot initiate a new vault lock for the vault.

     

    You can abort the vault locking process by calling  AbortVaultLock . You can get the state of the vault lock by calling  GetVaultLock . For more information about the vault locking process, `Amazon Glacier Vault Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock.html>`__ .

     

    If this operation is called when the vault lock is in the ``InProgress`` state, the operation returns an ``AccessDeniedException`` error. When the vault lock is in the ``InProgress`` state you must call  AbortVaultLock before you can initiate a new vault lock policy.

  .. py:method:: list_jobs(**kwargs)

    

    This operation lists jobs for a vault, including jobs that are in-progress and jobs that have recently finished. The List Job operation returns a list of these jobs sorted by job initiation time.

     

    .. note::

       

      Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before deleting them; however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The output of completed jobs can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs for a period of time after they have completed enables you to get a job output in the event you miss the job completion notification or your first attempt to download it fails. For example, suppose you start an archive retrieval job to download an archive. After the job completes, you start to download the archive but encounter a network error. In this scenario, you can retry and download the archive while the job exists.

       

     

    The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the response ``Marker`` field. If there are no more jobs to list, the ``Marker`` field is set to ``null`` . If there are more jobs to list, the ``Marker`` field is set to a non-null value, which you can use to continue the pagination of the list. To return a list of jobs that begins at a specific job, set the marker request parameter to the ``Marker`` value for that job that you obtained from a previous List Jobs request.

     

    You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the response by specifying the ``limit`` parameter in the request. The default limit is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the limit, but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit.

     

    Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the optional ``statuscode`` parameter or ``completed`` parameter, or both. Using the ``statuscode`` parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that match either the ``InProgress`` , ``Succeeded`` , or ``Failed`` status. Using the ``completed`` parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that were completed (``true`` ) or jobs that were not completed (``false`` ).

     

    For more information about using this operation, see the documentation for the underlying REST API `List Jobs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-jobs-get.html>`__ .

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.list_jobs(
          vaultName='string',
          limit='string',
          marker='string',
          statuscode='string',
          completed='string'
      )
    :type accountId: string
    :param accountId: 

      The ``AccountId`` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '``-`` ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID. 

            Note: this parameter is set to "-" bydefault if no value is not specified.


    
    :type vaultName: string
    :param vaultName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the vault.

      

    
    :type limit: string
    :param limit: 

      The maximum number of jobs to be returned. The default limit is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the specified limit, but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit.

      

    
    :type marker: string
    :param marker: 

      An opaque string used for pagination. This value specifies the job at which the listing of jobs should begin. Get the marker value from a previous List Jobs response. You only need to include the marker if you are continuing the pagination of results started in a previous List Jobs request.

      

    
    :type statuscode: string
    :param statuscode: 

      The type of job status to return. You can specify the following values: ``InProgress`` , ``Succeeded`` , or ``Failed`` .

      

    
    :type completed: string
    :param completed: 

      The state of the jobs to return. You can specify ``true`` or ``false`` .

  .. py:method:: list_multipart_uploads(**kwargs)

    

    This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads for the specified vault. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated by an  InitiateMultipartUpload request, but has not yet been completed or aborted. The list returned in the List Multipart Upload response has no guaranteed order. 

     

    The List Multipart Uploads operation supports pagination. By default, this operation returns up to 50 multipart uploads in the response. You should always check the response for a ``marker`` at which to continue the list; if there are no more items the ``marker`` is ``null`` . To return a list of multipart uploads that begins at a specific upload, set the ``marker`` request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous List Multipart Upload request. You can also limit the number of uploads returned in the response by specifying the ``limit`` parameter in the request.

     

    Note the difference between this operation and listing parts ( ListParts ). The List Multipart Uploads operation lists all multipart uploads for a vault and does not require a multipart upload ID. The List Parts operation requires a multipart upload ID since parts are associated with a single upload.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html>`__ .

     

    For conceptual information and the underlying REST API, see `Working with Archives in Amazon S3 Glacier <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/working-with-archives.html>`__ and `List Multipart Uploads <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-multipart-list-uploads.html>`__ in the *Amazon Glacier Developer Guide* .

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.list_multipart_uploads(
          vaultName='string',
          marker='string',
          limit='string'
      )
    :type accountId: string
    :param accountId: 

      The ``AccountId`` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '``-`` ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID. 

            Note: this parameter is set to "-" bydefault if no value is not specified.


    
    :type vaultName: string
    :param vaultName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the vault.

      

    
    :type marker: string
    :param marker: 

      An opaque string used for pagination. This value specifies the upload at which the listing of uploads should begin. Get the marker value from a previous List Uploads response. You need only include the marker if you are continuing the pagination of results started in a previous List Uploads request.

      

    
    :type limit: string
    :param limit: 

      Specifies the maximum number of uploads returned in the response body. If this value is not specified, the List Uploads operation returns up to 50 uploads.

  .. py:method:: list_parts(**kwargs)

    

    This operation lists the parts of an archive that have been uploaded in a specific multipart upload. You can make this request at any time during an in-progress multipart upload before you complete the upload (see  CompleteMultipartUpload . List Parts returns an error for completed uploads. The list returned in the List Parts response is sorted by part range. 

     

    The List Parts operation supports pagination. By default, this operation returns up to 50 uploaded parts in the response. You should always check the response for a ``marker`` at which to continue the list; if there are no more items the ``marker`` is ``null`` . To return a list of parts that begins at a specific part, set the ``marker`` request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous List Parts request. You can also limit the number of parts returned in the response by specifying the ``limit`` parameter in the request. 

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

  .. py:method:: set_vault_notifications(**kwargs)

    

    This operation configures notifications that will be sent when specific events happen to a vault. By default, you don't get any notifications.

     

    To configure vault notifications, send a PUT request to the ``notification-configuration`` subresource of the vault. The request should include a JSON document that provides an Amazon SNS topic and specific events for which you want Amazon S3 Glacier to send notifications to the topic.

     

    Amazon SNS topics must grant permission to the vault to be allowed to publish notifications to the topic. You can configure a vault to publish a notification for the following vault events:

     

     
    * **ArchiveRetrievalCompleted** This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an archive retrieval is completed ( InitiateJob ). The status of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from  DescribeJob .  
     
    * **InventoryRetrievalCompleted** This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an inventory retrieval is completed ( InitiateJob ). The status of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from  DescribeJob .  
     

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html>`__ .

  .. py:method:: upload_archive(**kwargs)

    

    This operation adds an archive to a vault. This is a synchronous operation, and for a successful upload, your data is durably persisted. Amazon S3 Glacier returns the archive ID in the ``x-amz-archive-id`` header of the response. 

     

    You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon S3 Glacier. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for better searching. You can also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see  InitiateJob . 

     

    You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see `Computing Checksums <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`__ . 

     

    You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII characters. You can get the archive description when you either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. For more information, see  InitiateJob . Amazon Glacier does not interpret the description in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive list. 

     

    Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the archive or its description.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

  .. py:method:: upload_multipart_part(**kwargs)

    

    This operation uploads a part of an archive. You can upload archive parts in any order. You can also upload them in parallel. You can upload up to 10,000 parts for a multipart upload.

     

    Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following conditions is true:

     

     
    * **SHA256 tree hash does not match** To ensure that part data is not corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon S3 Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don't match, the operation fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see `Computing Checksums <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`__ . 
     
    * **Part size does not match** The size of each part except the last must match the size specified in the corresponding  InitiateMultipartUpload request. The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size. 

    .. note::

       If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail. 

     
     
    * **Range does not align** The byte range value in the request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail.  
     

     

    This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites the previously uploaded data.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html>`__ .

  These are the resource's available actions:
  
  *   :py:meth:`create_vault()`

  
  *   :py:meth:`get_available_subresources()`

  
  These are the resource's available sub-resources:

  *   :py:meth:`Archive()`

  
  *   :py:meth:`Job()`

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: create_vault(**kwargs)

    

    This operation creates a new vault with the specified name. The name of the vault must be unique within a region for an AWS account. You can create up to 1,000 vaults per account. If you need to create more vaults, contact Amazon S3 Glacier.

     

    You must use the following guidelines when naming a vault.

     

     
    * Names can be between 1 and 255 characters long. 
     
    * Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), and '.' (period). 
     

     

    This operation is idempotent.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html>`__ .

     

    For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see `Creating a Vault in Amazon Glacier <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/creating-vaults.html>`__ and `Create Vault <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-vault-put.html>`__ in the *Amazon Glacier Developer Guide* .

    This operation creates a new vault with the specified name. The name of the vault must be unique within a region for an AWS account. You can create up to 1,000 vaults per account. If you need to create more vaults, contact Amazon S3 Glacier.

     

    You must use the following guidelines when naming a vault.

     

     
    * Names can be between 1 and 255 characters long. 
     
    * Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), and '.' (period). 
     

     

    This operation is idempotent.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: delete()

    

    This operation deletes an archive from a vault. Subsequent requests to initiate a retrieval of this archive will fail. Archive retrievals that are in progress for this archive ID may or may not succeed according to the following scenarios:

     

     
    * If the archive retrieval job is actively preparing the data for download when Amazon S3 Glacier receives the delete archive request, the archival retrieval operation might fail. 
     
    * If the archive retrieval job has successfully prepared the archive for download when Amazon S3 Glacier receives the delete archive request, you will be able to download the output. 
     

     

    This operation is idempotent. Attempting to delete an already-deleted archive does not result in an error.

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: get_available_subresources()

        
    Returns a list of all the available sub-resources for this
    Resource.
    
    :returns: A list containing the name of each sub-resource for this
        resource
    :rtype: list of str


  .. py:method:: get_output(**kwargs)

    

    This operation downloads the output of the job you initiated using  InitiateJob . Depending on the job type you specified when you initiated the job, the output will be either the content of an archive or a vault inventory.

     

    You can download all the job output or download a portion of the output by specifying a byte range. In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) returns the checksum for the portion of the data. You can compute the checksum on the client and verify that the values match to ensure the portion you downloaded is the correct data.

     

    A job ID will not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier completes the job. That a byte range. For both archive and inventory retrieval jobs, you should verify the downloaded size against the size returned in the headers from the **Get Job Output** response.

     

    For archive retrieval jobs, you should also verify that the size is what you expected. If you download a portion of the output, the expected size is based on the range of bytes you specified. For example, if you specify a range of ``bytes=0-1048575`` , you should verify your download size is 1,048,576 bytes. If you download an entire archive, the expected size is the size of the archive when you uploaded it to Amazon S3 Glacier The expected size is also returned in the headers from the **Get Job Output** response.

     

    In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify, Glacier returns the checksum for the portion of the data. To ensure the portion you downloaded is the correct data, compute the checksum on the client, verify that the values match, and verify that the size is what you expected.

     

    A job ID does not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier completes the job. That is, you can download the job output within the 24 hours period after Amazon Glacier completes the job.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html>`__ .

    ::

      response = job.get_output(
          range='string'
      )
    :type range: string
    :param range: 

      The range of bytes to retrieve from the output. For example, if you want to download the first 1,048,576 bytes, specify the range as ``bytes=0-1048575`` . By default, this operation downloads the entire output.

       

      If the job output is large, then you can use a range to retrieve a portion of the output. This allows you to download the entire output in smaller chunks of bytes. For example, suppose you have 1 GB of job output you want to download and you decide to download 128 MB chunks of data at a time, which is a total of eight Get Job Output requests. You use the following process to download the job output:

       

       
      * Download a 128 MB chunk of output by specifying the appropriate byte range. Verify that all 128 MB of data was received. 
       
      * Along with the data, the response includes a SHA256 tree hash of the payload. You compute the checksum of the payload on the client and compare it with the checksum you received in the response to ensure you received all the expected data. 
       
      * Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all the eight 128 MB chunks of output data, each time specifying the appropriate byte range. 
       
      * After downloading all the parts of the job output, you have a list of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these values to find the checksum of the entire output. Using the  DescribeJob API, obtain job information of the job that provided you the output. The response includes the checksum of the entire archive stored in Amazon S3 Glacier. You compare this value with the checksum you computed to ensure you have downloaded the entire archive content with no errors.

        Contains the Amazon S3 Glacier response to your request.

        
        

        - **body** (:class:`.StreamingBody`) -- 

          The job data, either archive data or inventory data.

          
        

        - **checksum** *(string) --* 

          The checksum of the data in the response. This header is returned only when retrieving the output for an archive retrieval job. Furthermore, this header appears only under the following conditions:

           

           
          * You get the entire range of the archive. 
           
          * You request a range to return of the archive that starts and ends on a multiple of 1 MB. For example, if you have an 3.1 MB archive and you specify a range to return that starts at 1 MB and ends at 2 MB, then the x-amz-sha256-tree-hash is returned as a response header. 
           
          * You request a range of the archive to return that starts on a multiple of 1 MB and goes to the end of the archive. For example, if you have a 3.1 MB archive and you specify a range that starts at 2 MB and ends at 3.1 MB (the end of the archive), then the x-amz-sha256-tree-hash is returned as a response header. 
           

          
        

        - **status** *(integer) --* 

          The HTTP response code for a job output request. The value depends on whether a range was specified in the request.

          
        

        - **contentRange** *(string) --* 

          The range of bytes returned by Amazon S3 Glacier. If only partial output is downloaded, the response provides the range of bytes Amazon S3 Glacier returned. For example, bytes 0-1048575/8388608 returns the first 1 MB from 8 MB.

          
        

        - **acceptRanges** *(string) --* 

          Indicates the range units accepted. For more information, see `RFC2616 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html>`__ . 

          
        

        - **contentType** *(string) --* 

          The Content-Type depends on whether the job output is an archive or a vault inventory. For archive data, the Content-Type is application/octet-stream. For vault inventory, if you requested CSV format when you initiated the job, the Content-Type is text/csv. Otherwise, by default, vault inventory is returned as JSON, and the Content-Type is application/json.

          
        

        - **archiveDescription** *(string) --* 

          The description of an archive.

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = multipart_upload.abort()
      
    
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: complete(**kwargs)

    

    You call this operation to inform Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) that all the archive parts have been uploaded and that Glacier can now assemble the archive from the uploaded parts. After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see  InitiateJob .

     

    In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see `Computing Checksums <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`__ . On the server side, Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Glacier saves the archive to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The  ListParts operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue.

     

    Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Glacier returns an error and the operation fails.

     

    Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

  .. py:method:: parts(**kwargs)

    

    This operation lists the parts of an archive that have been uploaded in a specific multipart upload. You can make this request at any time during an in-progress multipart upload before you complete the upload (see  CompleteMultipartUpload . List Parts returns an error for completed uploads. The list returned in the List Parts response is sorted by part range. 

     

    The List Parts operation supports pagination. By default, this operation returns up to 50 uploaded parts in the response. You should always check the response for a ``marker`` at which to continue the list; if there are no more items the ``marker`` is ``null`` . To return a list of parts that begins at a specific part, set the ``marker`` request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous List Parts request. You can also limit the number of parts returned in the response by specifying the ``limit`` parameter in the request.

  .. py:method:: upload_part(**kwargs)

    

    This operation uploads a part of an archive. You can upload archive parts in any order. You can also upload them in parallel. You can upload up to 10,000 parts for a multipart upload.

     

    Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following conditions is true:

     

     
    * **SHA256 tree hash does not match** To ensure that part data is not corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon S3 Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don't match, the operation fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see `Computing Checksums <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`__ . 
     
    * **Part size does not match** The size of each part except the last must match the size specified in the corresponding  InitiateMultipartUpload request. The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size. 

    .. note::

       If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail. 

     
     
    * **Range does not align** The byte range value in the request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail.  
     

     

    This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites the previously uploaded data.

    This operation configures notifications that will be sent when specific events happen to a vault. By default, you don't get any notifications.

     

    To configure vault notifications, send a PUT request to the ``notification-configuration`` subresource of the vault. The request should include a JSON document that provides an Amazon SNS topic and specific events for which you want Amazon S3 Glacier to send notifications to the topic.

     

    Amazon SNS topics must grant permission to the vault to be allowed to publish notifications to the topic. You can configure a vault to publish a notification for the following vault events:

     

     
    * **ArchiveRetrievalCompleted** This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an archive retrieval is completed ( InitiateJob ). The status of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from  DescribeJob .  
     
    * **InventoryRetrievalCompleted** This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an inventory retrieval is completed ( InitiateJob ). The status of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from  DescribeJob .

  Identifiers
  
  Identifiers are properties of a resource that are set upon instantation of the resource.
  For more information about identifiers refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: account_id

    *(string)* The Vault's account_id identifier. This **must** be set.

  .. py:attribute:: name

    *(string)* The Vault's name identifier. This **must** be set.
  .. rst-class:: admonition-title
  
  Attributes
  
  Attributes provide access to the properties of a resource. Attributes are lazy-loaded the first time one is accessed via the :py:meth:`load` method.
  For more information about attributes refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: creation_date

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) date when the vault was created. This value should be a string in the ISO 8601 date format, for example ``2012-03-20T17:03:43.221Z`` .

      

  .. py:attribute:: last_inventory_date

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) date when Amazon S3 Glacier completed the last vault inventory. This value should be a string in the ISO 8601 date format, for example ``2012-03-20T17:03:43.221Z`` .

      

  .. py:attribute:: number_of_archives

    

    - *(integer) --* 

      The number of archives in the vault as of the last inventory date. This field will return ``null`` if an inventory has not yet run on the vault, for example if you just created the vault.

      

  .. py:attribute:: size_in_bytes

    

    - *(integer) --* 

      Total size, in bytes, of the archives in the vault as of the last inventory date. This field will return null if an inventory has not yet run on the vault, for example if you just created the vault.

      

  .. py:attribute:: vault_arn

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vault.

      

  .. py:attribute:: vault_name

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The name of the vault.

      
  .. rst-class:: admonition-title
  
  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: create()

    

    This operation creates a new vault with the specified name. The name of the vault must be unique within a region for an AWS account. You can create up to 1,000 vaults per account. If you need to create more vaults, contact Amazon S3 Glacier.

     

    You must use the following guidelines when naming a vault.

     

     
    * Names can be between 1 and 255 characters long. 
     
    * Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), and '.' (period). 
     

     

    This operation is idempotent.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html>`__ .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        Contains the Amazon S3 Glacier response to your request.

        
        

        - **location** *(string) --* 

          The URI of the vault that was created.

          
    

  .. py:method:: delete()

    

    This operation deletes a vault. Amazon S3 Glacier will delete a vault only if there are no archives in the vault as of the last inventory and there have been no writes to the vault since the last inventory. If either of these conditions is not satisfied, the vault deletion fails (that is, the vault is not removed) and Amazon S3 Glacier returns an error. You can use  DescribeVault to return the number of archives in a vault, and you can use `Initiate a Job (POST jobs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-initiate-job-post.html>`__ to initiate a new inventory retrieval for a vault. The inventory contains the archive IDs you use to delete archives using `Delete Archive (DELETE archive) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-delete.html>`__ .

     

    This operation is idempotent.

  .. py:method:: initiate_multipart_upload(**kwargs)

    

    This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon S3 Glacier creates a multipart upload resource and returns its ID in the response. The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of an archive (see  UploadMultipartPart ).

     

    When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB.

     

    Every part you upload to this resource (see  UploadMultipartPart ), except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB. 

     

    .. note::

       

      You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because Amazon S3 Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size.

       

     

    After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Glacier also removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart upload or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24 hours.

     

    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

  .. py:method:: upload_archive(**kwargs)

    

    This operation adds an archive to a vault. This is a synchronous operation, and for a successful upload, your data is durably persisted. Amazon S3 Glacier returns the archive ID in the ``x-amz-archive-id`` header of the response. 

     

    You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon S3 Glacier. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for better searching. You can also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see  InitiateJob . 

     

    You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see `Computing Checksums <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`__ . 

     

    You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII characters. You can get the archive description when you either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. For more information, see  InitiateJob . Amazon Glacier does not interpret the description in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive list. 

     

    Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the archive or its description.
