.. py:class:: OpsWorksCM.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS OpsWorks CM (OpsWorksCM)
   

  AWS OpsWorks for configuration management (CM) is a service that runs and manages configuration management servers. You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise servers, and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage.

   

   **Glossary of terms**  

   

   
  * **Server** : A configuration management server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted. 
   
  * **Engine** : The engine is the specific configuration manager that you want to use. Valid values in this release include ``ChefAutomate`` and ``Puppet`` . 
   
  * **Backup** : This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup starts. 
   
  * **Events** : Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted. 
   
  * **Account attributes** : Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account.  
   

   

   **Endpoints**  

   

  AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.

   

   
  * opsworks-cm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com 
   
  * opsworks-cm.us-east-2.amazonaws.com 
   
  * opsworks-cm.us-west-1.amazonaws.com 
   
  * opsworks-cm.us-west-2.amazonaws.com 
   
  * opsworks-cm.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com 
   
  * opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com 
   
  * opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com 
   
  * opsworks-cm.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com 
   
  * opsworks-cm.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com 
   

   

  For more information, see `AWS OpsWorks endpoints and quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/opsworks-service.html>`__ in the AWS General Reference.

   

   **Throttling limits**  

   

  All API operations allow for five requests per second with a burst of 10 requests per second.

  .. py:method:: associate_node(**kwargs)

    

    Associates a new node with the server. For more information about how to disassociate a node, see  DisassociateNode .

     

    On a Chef server: This command is an alternative to ``knife bootstrap`` .

     

    Example (Chef): ``aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name *MyServer* --node-name *MyManagedNode* --engine-attributes "Name=*CHEF_ORGANIZATION* ,Value=default" "Name=*CHEF_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY* ,Value=*public-key-pem* "``  

     

    On a Puppet server, this command is an alternative to the ``puppet cert sign`` command that signs a Puppet node CSR. 

     

    Example (Puppet): ``aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name *MyServer* --node-name *MyManagedNode* --engine-attributes "Name=*PUPPET_NODE_CSR* ,Value=*csr-pem* "``  

     

    A node can can only be associated with servers that are in a ``HEALTHY`` state. Otherwise, an ``InvalidStateException`` is thrown. A ``ResourceNotFoundException`` is thrown when the server does not exist. A ``ValidationException`` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid. The AssociateNode API call can be integrated into Auto Scaling configurations, AWS Cloudformation templates, or the user data of a server's instance.

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: create_backup(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an application-level backup of a server. While the server is in the ``BACKING_UP`` state, the server cannot be changed, and no additional backup can be created. 

     

    Backups can be created for servers in ``RUNNING`` , ``HEALTHY`` , and ``UNHEALTHY`` states. By default, you can create a maximum of 50 manual backups. 

     

    This operation is asynchronous. 

     

    A ``LimitExceededException`` is thrown when the maximum number of manual backups is reached. An ``InvalidStateException`` is thrown when the server is not in any of the following states: RUNNING, HEALTHY, or UNHEALTHY. A ``ResourceNotFoundException`` is thrown when the server is not found. A ``ValidationException`` is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.

  .. py:method:: create_server(**kwargs)

    

    Creates and immedately starts a new server. The server is ready to use when it is in the ``HEALTHY`` state. By default, you can create a maximum of 10 servers. 

     

    This operation is asynchronous. 

     

    A ``LimitExceededException`` is thrown when you have created the maximum number of servers (10). A ``ResourceAlreadyExistsException`` is thrown when a server with the same name already exists in the account. A ``ResourceNotFoundException`` is thrown when you specify a backup ID that is not valid or is for a backup that does not exist. A ``ValidationException`` is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid. 

     

    If you do not specify a security group by adding the ``SecurityGroupIds`` parameter, AWS OpsWorks creates a new security group. 

     

     *Chef Automate:* The default security group opens the Chef server to the world on TCP port 443. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22. 

     

     *Puppet Enterprise:* The default security group opens TCP ports 22, 443, 4433, 8140, 8142, 8143, and 8170. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22. 

     

    By default, your server is accessible from any IP address. We recommend that you update your security group rules to allow access from known IP addresses and address ranges only. To edit security group rules, open Security Groups in the navigation pane of the EC2 management console. 

     

    To specify your own domain for a server, and provide your own self-signed or CA-signed certificate and private key, specify values for ``CustomDomain`` , ``CustomCertificate`` , and ``CustomPrivateKey`` .

  .. py:method:: disassociate_node(**kwargs)

    

    Disassociates a node from an AWS OpsWorks CM server, and removes the node from the server's managed nodes. After a node is disassociated, the node key pair is no longer valid for accessing the configuration manager's API. For more information about how to associate a node, see  AssociateNode . 

     

    A node can can only be disassociated from a server that is in a ``HEALTHY`` state. Otherwise, an ``InvalidStateException`` is thrown. A ``ResourceNotFoundException`` is thrown when the server does not exist. A ``ValidationException`` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.

      The list of engine attributes. The list type is ``EngineAttribute`` . An ``EngineAttribute`` list item is a pair that includes an attribute name and its value. For the ``Userdata`` ExportAttributeName, the following are supported engine attribute names.

       

       
      * **RunList** In Chef, a list of roles or recipes that are run in the specified order. In Puppet, this parameter is ignored. 
       
      * **OrganizationName** In Chef, an organization name. AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate always creates the organization ``default`` . In Puppet, this parameter is ignored. 
       
      * **NodeEnvironment** In Chef, a node environment (for example, development, staging, or one-box). In Puppet, this parameter is ignored. 
       
      * **NodeClientVersion** In Chef, the version of the Chef engine (three numbers separated by dots, such as 13.8.5). If this attribute is empty, OpsWorks for Chef Automate uses the most current version. In Puppet, this parameter is ignored.

    :type ResourceArn: string
    :param ResourceArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of an AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate or AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise server for which you want to show applied tags. For example, ``arn:aws:opsworks-cm:us-west-2:123456789012:server/test-owcm-server/EXAMPLE-66b0-4196-8274-d1a2bEXAMPLE`` .

      

    
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      NextToken is a string that is returned in some command responses. It indicates that not all entries have been returned, and that you must run at least one more request to get remaining items. To get remaining results, call ``ListTagsForResource`` again, and assign the token from the previous results as the value of the ``nextToken`` parameter. If there are no more results, the response object's ``nextToken`` parameter value is ``null`` . Setting a ``nextToken`` value that was not returned in your previous results causes an ``InvalidNextTokenException`` to occur.

      

    
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      To receive a paginated response, use this parameter to specify the maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a ``NextToken`` value that you can assign to the ``NextToken`` request parameter to get the next set of results.

  .. py:method:: restore_server(**kwargs)

    

    Restores a backup to a server that is in a ``CONNECTION_LOST`` , ``HEALTHY`` , ``RUNNING`` , ``UNHEALTHY`` , or ``TERMINATED`` state. When you run RestoreServer, the server's EC2 instance is deleted, and a new EC2 instance is configured. RestoreServer maintains the existing server endpoint, so configuration management of the server's client devices (nodes) should continue to work. 

     

    Restoring from a backup is performed by creating a new EC2 instance. If restoration is successful, and the server is in a ``HEALTHY`` state, AWS OpsWorks CM switches traffic over to the new instance. After restoration is finished, the old EC2 instance is maintained in a ``Running`` or ``Stopped`` state, but is eventually terminated.

     

    This operation is asynchronous. 

     

    An ``InvalidStateException`` is thrown when the server is not in a valid state. A ``ResourceNotFoundException`` is thrown when the server does not exist. A ``ValidationException`` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.

  .. py:method:: update_server_engine_attributes(**kwargs)

    

    Updates engine-specific attributes on a specified server. The server enters the ``MODIFYING`` state when this operation is in progress. Only one update can occur at a time. You can use this command to reset a Chef server's public key (``CHEF_PIVOTAL_KEY`` ) or a Puppet server's admin password (``PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD`` ). 

     

    This operation is asynchronous. 

     

    This operation can only be called for servers in ``HEALTHY`` or ``UNHEALTHY`` states. Otherwise, an ``InvalidStateException`` is raised. A ``ResourceNotFoundException`` is thrown when the server does not exist. A ``ValidationException`` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.
