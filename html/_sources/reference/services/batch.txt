.. py:class:: Batch.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Batch
  

  Using AWS Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. AWS Batch uses the advantages of this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these advantages, AWS Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted, thus effectively helping you to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more quickly.

   

  As a fully managed service, AWS Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific workloads. With AWS Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus your time and energy on analyzing results and solving your specific problems.

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: cancel_job(**kwargs)

    

    Cancels a job in an AWS Batch job queue. Jobs that are in the ``SUBMITTED`` , ``PENDING`` , or ``RUNNABLE`` state are canceled. Jobs that have progressed to ``STARTING`` or ``RUNNING`` aren't canceled, but the API operation still succeeds, even if no job is canceled. These jobs must be terminated with the  TerminateJob operation.

  .. py:method:: create_compute_environment(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an AWS Batch compute environment. You can create ``MANAGED`` or ``UNMANAGED`` compute environments. ``MANAGED`` compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate resources. ``UNMANAGED`` compute environments can only use EC2 resources.

     

    In a managed compute environment, AWS Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the `launch template <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html>`__ that you specify when you create the compute environment. Either, you can choose to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances. Or, you can use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.

     

    .. note::

       

      Multi-node parallel jobs aren't supported on Spot Instances.

       

     

    In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have a lot of flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMIs. However, you must verify that each of your AMIs meet the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see `container instance AMIs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* . After you created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the  DescribeComputeEnvironments operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that's associated with it. Then, launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see `Launching an Amazon ECS container instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

      AWS Batch doesn't upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after the environment is created. For example, it doesn't update the AMIs when a newer version of the Amazon ECS optimized AMI is available. Therefore, you're responsible for managing the guest operating system (including its updates and security patches) and any additional application software or utilities that you install on the compute resources. To use a new AMI for your AWS Batch jobs, complete these steps:

       

       
      * Create a new compute environment with the new AMI. 
       
      * Add the compute environment to an existing job queue. 
       
      * Remove the earlier compute environment from your job queue. 
       
      * Delete the earlier compute environment.

      )
    :type computeEnvironmentName: string
    :param computeEnvironmentName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name for your compute environment. Up to 128 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.

      

    
    :type type: string
    :param type: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The type of the compute environment: ``MANAGED`` or ``UNMANAGED`` . For more information, see `Compute Environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

      

    
    :type state: string
    :param state: 

      The state of the compute environment. If the state is ``ENABLED`` , then the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out automatically based on queues.

       

      If the state is ``ENABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.

       

      If the state is ``DISABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a ``STARTING`` or ``RUNNING`` state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the ``DISABLED`` state don't scale out. However, they scale in to ``minvCpus`` value after instances become idle.

      

    
    :type computeResources: dict
    :param computeResources: 

      Details about the compute resources managed by the compute environment. This parameter is required for managed compute environments. For more information, see `Compute Environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of compute environment: ``EC2`` , ``SPOT`` , ``FARGATE`` , or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` . For more information, see `Compute Environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

         

        If you choose ``SPOT`` , you must also specify an Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role with the ``spotIamFleetRole`` parameter. For more information, see `Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/spot_fleet_IAM_role.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

        

      
      - **allocationStrategy** *(string) --* 

        The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This might be because of availability of the instance type in the Region or `Amazon EC2 service limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>`__ . For more information, see `Allocation Strategies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/allocation-strategies.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

           

          BEST_FIT (default)  

        AWS Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren't available, AWS Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren't enough instances available, or if the user is hitting `Amazon EC2 service limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>`__ then additional jobs aren't run until the currently running jobs have completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with ``BEST_FIT`` then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified.

          BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE  

        AWS Batch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren't available, AWS Batch will select new instance types.

          SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED  

        AWS Batch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.

           

        With both ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE`` and ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` strategies, AWS Batch might need to go above ``maxvCpus`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds ``maxvCpus`` by more than a single instance.

        

      
      - **minvCpus** *(integer) --* 

        The minimum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environment should maintain (even if the compute environment is ``DISABLED`` ).

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

           

        

      
      - **maxvCpus** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The maximum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that a compute environment can reach.

         

        .. note::

           

          With both ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE`` and ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` allocation strategies, AWS Batch might need to exceed ``maxvCpus`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds ``maxvCpus`` by more than a single instance. For example, no more than a single instance from among those specified in your compute environment is allocated.

           

        

      
      - **desiredvCpus** *(integer) --* 

        The desired number of Amazon EC2 vCPUS in the compute environment. AWS Batch modifies this value between the minimum and maximum values, based on job queue demand.

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

           

        

      
      - **instanceTypes** *(list) --* 

        The instances types that can be launched. You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, ``c5`` or ``p3`` ), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as ``c5.8xlarge`` ). You can also choose ``optimal`` to select instance types (from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families) that match the demand of your job queues.

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

           

         

        .. note::

           

          When you create a compute environment, the instance types that you select for the compute environment must share the same architecture. For example, you can't mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute environment.

           

         

        .. note::

           

          Currently, ``optimal`` uses instance types from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families. In Regions that don't have instance types from those instance families, instance types from the C5, M5. and R5 instance families are used.

           

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **imageId** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is overridden by the ``imageIdOverride`` member of the ``Ec2Configuration`` structure.

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

           

         

        .. note::

           

          The AMI that you choose for a compute environment must match the architecture of the instance types that you intend to use for that compute environment. For example, if your compute environment uses A1 instance types, the compute resource AMI that you choose must support ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both x86 and ARM versions of the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. For more information, see `Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#ecs-optimized-ami-linux-variants.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

           

        

      
      - **subnets** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The VPC subnets into which the compute resources are launched. These subnets must be within the same VPC. Fargate compute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For more information, see `VPCs and Subnets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* .

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **securityGroupIds** *(list) --* 

        The Amazon EC2 security groups associated with instances launched in the compute environment. One or more security groups must be specified, either in ``securityGroupIds`` or using a launch template referenced in ``launchTemplate`` . This parameter is required for jobs running on Fargate resources and must contain at least one security group. Fargate doesn't support launch templates. If security groups are specified using both ``securityGroupIds`` and ``launchTemplate`` , the values in ``securityGroupIds`` is used.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **ec2KeyPair** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon EC2 key pair that's used for instances launched in the compute environment. You can use this key pair to log in to your instances with SSH.

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

           

        

      
      - **instanceRole** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, `` *ecsInstanceRole* `` or ``arn:aws:iam::*<aws_account_id>* :instance-profile/*ecsInstanceRole* `` . For more information, see `Amazon ECS Instance Role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/instance_IAM_role.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

           

        

      
      - **tags** *(dict) --* 

        Key-value pair tags to be applied to EC2 resources that are launched in the compute environment. For AWS Batch, these take the form of "String1": "String2", where String1 is the tag key and String2 is the tag value−for example, { "Name": "AWS Batch Instance - C4OnDemand" }. This is helpful for recognizing your AWS Batch instances in the Amazon EC2 console. These tags can't be updated or removed after the compute environment has been created; any changes require creating a new compute environment and removing the old compute environment. These tags aren't seen when using the AWS Batch ``ListTagsForResource`` API operation.

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

           

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
    
  
      - **placementGroup** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute resources. If you intend to submit multi-node parallel jobs to your compute environment, you should consider creating a cluster placement group and associate it with your compute resources. This keeps your multi-node parallel job on a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone with high network flow potential. For more information, see `Placement Groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* .

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

           

        

      
      - **bidPercentage** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be less than 20% of the current On-Demand price for that Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of the On-Demand price.

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

           

        

      
      - **spotIamFleetRole** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a ``SPOT`` compute environment. This role is required if the allocation strategy set to ``BEST_FIT`` or if the allocation strategy isn't specified.

    :param serviceRole: 

      The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows AWS Batch to make calls to other AWS services on your behalf. For more information, see `AWS Batch service IAM role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

       

      .. warning::

         

        If your account has already created the AWS Batch service-linked role, that role is used by default for your compute environment unless you specify a role here. If the AWS Batch service-linked role does not exist in your account, and no role is specified here, the service will try to create the AWS Batch service-linked role in your account.

         

       

      If your specified role has a path other than ``/`` , then you must specify either the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name ``bar`` has a path of ``/foo/`` then you would specify ``/foo/bar`` as the role name. For more information, see `Friendly names and paths <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

       

      .. note::

         

        Depending on how you created your AWS Batch service role, its ARN might contain the ``service-role`` path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, AWS Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the ``service-role`` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.

  .. py:method:: create_job_queue(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an AWS Batch job queue. When you create a job queue, you associate one or more compute environments to the queue and assign an order of preference for the compute environments.

     

    You also set a priority to the job queue that determines the order that the AWS Batch scheduler places jobs onto its associated compute environments. For example, if a compute environment is associated with more than one job queue, the job queue with a higher priority is given preference for scheduling jobs to that compute environment.

      The name of the job queue. Up to 128 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and underscores are allowed.

      

    
    :type state: string
    :param state: 

      The state of the job queue. If the job queue state is ``ENABLED`` , it is able to accept jobs. If the job queue state is ``DISABLED`` , new jobs can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.

    :param priority: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the ``priority`` parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a priority value of ``10`` is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of ``1`` . All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (``EC2`` or ``SPOT`` ) or Fargate (``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments cannot be mixed.

      

    
    :type computeEnvironmentOrder: list
    :param computeEnvironmentOrder: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order relative to each other. The job scheduler uses this parameter to determine which compute environment should run a specific job. Compute environments must be in the ``VALID`` state before you can associate them with a job queue. You can associate up to three compute environments with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (``EC2`` or ``SPOT`` ) or Fargate (``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

       

      .. note::

         

        All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. AWS Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.

         

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The order in which compute environments are tried for job placement within a queue. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried for job placement first. Compute environments must be in the ``VALID`` state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (``EC2`` or ``SPOT`` ) or Fargate (``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

  .. py:method:: delete_compute_environment(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes an AWS Batch compute environment.

     

    Before you can delete a compute environment, you must set its state to ``DISABLED`` with the  UpdateComputeEnvironment API operation and disassociate it from any job queues with the  UpdateJobQueue API operation. Compute environments that use AWS Fargate resources must terminate all active jobs on that compute environment before deleting the compute environment. If this isn't done, the compute environment enters an invalid state.

  .. py:method:: delete_job_queue(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the specified job queue. You must first disable submissions for a queue with the  UpdateJobQueue operation. All jobs in the queue are eventually terminated when you delete a job queue. The jobs are terminated at a rate of about 16 jobs each second.

     

    It's not necessary to disassociate compute environments from a queue before submitting a ``DeleteJobQueue`` request.

    :type maxResults: integer
    :param maxResults: 

      The maximum number of cluster results returned by ``DescribeComputeEnvironments`` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ``DescribeComputeEnvironments`` only returns ``maxResults`` results in a single page along with a ``nextToken`` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ``DescribeComputeEnvironments`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then ``DescribeComputeEnvironments`` returns up to 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.

      

    
    :type nextToken: string
    :param nextToken: 

      The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated ``DescribeComputeEnvironments`` request where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.

       

      .. note::

         

        This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **computeEnvironments** *(list) --* 

          The list of compute environments.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            An object representing an AWS Batch compute environment.

            
            

            - **computeEnvironmentName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the compute environment. Up to 128 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.

              
            

            - **computeEnvironmentArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.

              
            

            - **ecsClusterArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the underlying Amazon ECS cluster used by the compute environment.

              
            

            - **tags** *(dict) --* 

              The tags applied to the compute environment.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
                

                - *(string) --* 
          
        
            

            - **type** *(string) --* 

              The type of the compute environment: ``MANAGED`` or ``UNMANAGED`` . For more information, see `Compute Environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

              
            

            - **state** *(string) --* 

              The state of the compute environment. The valid values are ``ENABLED`` or ``DISABLED`` .

               

              If the state is ``ENABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.

               

              If the state is ``DISABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a ``STARTING`` or ``RUNNING`` state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the ``DISABLED`` state don't scale out. However, they scale in to ``minvCpus`` value after instances become idle.

              
            

            - **status** *(string) --* 

              The current status of the compute environment (for example, ``CREATING`` or ``VALID`` ).

              
            

            - **statusReason** *(string) --* 

              A short, human-readable string to provide additional details about the current status of the compute environment.

              
            

            - **computeResources** *(dict) --* 

              The compute resources defined for the compute environment. For more information, see `Compute Environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

              
              

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                The type of compute environment: ``EC2`` , ``SPOT`` , ``FARGATE`` , or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` . For more information, see `Compute Environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                 

                If you choose ``SPOT`` , you must also specify an Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role with the ``spotIamFleetRole`` parameter. For more information, see `Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/spot_fleet_IAM_role.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                
              

              - **allocationStrategy** *(string) --* 

                The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This might be because of availability of the instance type in the Region or `Amazon EC2 service limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>`__ . For more information, see `Allocation Strategies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/allocation-strategies.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                   

                  BEST_FIT (default)  

                AWS Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren't available, AWS Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren't enough instances available, or if the user is hitting `Amazon EC2 service limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>`__ then additional jobs aren't run until the currently running jobs have completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with ``BEST_FIT`` then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified.

                  BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE  

                AWS Batch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren't available, AWS Batch will select new instance types.

                  SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED  

                AWS Batch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.

                   

                With both ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE`` and ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` strategies, AWS Batch might need to go above ``maxvCpus`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds ``maxvCpus`` by more than a single instance.

                
              

              - **minvCpus** *(integer) --* 

                The minimum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environment should maintain (even if the compute environment is ``DISABLED`` ).

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                   

                
              

              - **maxvCpus** *(integer) --* 

                The maximum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that a compute environment can reach.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  With both ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE`` and ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` allocation strategies, AWS Batch might need to exceed ``maxvCpus`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds ``maxvCpus`` by more than a single instance. For example, no more than a single instance from among those specified in your compute environment is allocated.

                   

                
              

              - **desiredvCpus** *(integer) --* 

                The desired number of Amazon EC2 vCPUS in the compute environment. AWS Batch modifies this value between the minimum and maximum values, based on job queue demand.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                   

                
              

              - **instanceTypes** *(list) --* 

                The instances types that can be launched. You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, ``c5`` or ``p3`` ), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as ``c5.8xlarge`` ). You can also choose ``optimal`` to select instance types (from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families) that match the demand of your job queues.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                   

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  When you create a compute environment, the instance types that you select for the compute environment must share the same architecture. For example, you can't mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute environment.

                   

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  Currently, ``optimal`` uses instance types from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families. In Regions that don't have instance types from those instance families, instance types from the C5, M5. and R5 instance families are used.

                   

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **imageId** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is overridden by the ``imageIdOverride`` member of the ``Ec2Configuration`` structure.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                   

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The AMI that you choose for a compute environment must match the architecture of the instance types that you intend to use for that compute environment. For example, if your compute environment uses A1 instance types, the compute resource AMI that you choose must support ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both x86 and ARM versions of the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. For more information, see `Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#ecs-optimized-ami-linux-variants.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                   

                
              

              - **subnets** *(list) --* 

                The VPC subnets into which the compute resources are launched. These subnets must be within the same VPC. Fargate compute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For more information, see `VPCs and Subnets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* .

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **securityGroupIds** *(list) --* 

                The Amazon EC2 security groups associated with instances launched in the compute environment. One or more security groups must be specified, either in ``securityGroupIds`` or using a launch template referenced in ``launchTemplate`` . This parameter is required for jobs running on Fargate resources and must contain at least one security group. Fargate doesn't support launch templates. If security groups are specified using both ``securityGroupIds`` and ``launchTemplate`` , the values in ``securityGroupIds`` is used.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **ec2KeyPair** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon EC2 key pair that's used for instances launched in the compute environment. You can use this key pair to log in to your instances with SSH.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                   

                
              

              - **instanceRole** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, `` *ecsInstanceRole* `` or ``arn:aws:iam::*<aws_account_id>* :instance-profile/*ecsInstanceRole* `` . For more information, see `Amazon ECS Instance Role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/instance_IAM_role.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

              - **tags** *(dict) --* 

                Key-value pair tags to be applied to EC2 resources that are launched in the compute environment. For AWS Batch, these take the form of "String1": "String2", where String1 is the tag key and String2 is the tag value−for example, { "Name": "AWS Batch Instance - C4OnDemand" }. This is helpful for recognizing your AWS Batch instances in the Amazon EC2 console. These tags can't be updated or removed after the compute environment has been created; any changes require creating a new compute environment and removing the old compute environment. These tags aren't seen when using the AWS Batch ``ListTagsForResource`` API operation.

                 

                .. note::

              - **placementGroup** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute resources. If you intend to submit multi-node parallel jobs to your compute environment, you should consider creating a cluster placement group and associate it with your compute resources. This keeps your multi-node parallel job on a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone with high network flow potential. For more information, see `Placement Groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* .

              - **bidPercentage** *(integer) --* 

                The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be less than 20% of the current On-Demand price for that Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of the On-Demand price.

              - **spotIamFleetRole** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a ``SPOT`` compute environment. This role is required if the allocation strategy set to ``BEST_FIT`` or if the allocation strategy isn't specified. For more information, see `Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet Role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/spot_fleet_IAM_role.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                  To tag your Spot Instances on creation, the Spot Fleet IAM role specified here must use the newer **AmazonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole** managed policy. The previously recommended **AmazonEC2SpotFleetRole** managed policy doesn't have the required permissions to tag Spot Instances. For more information, see `Spot Instances not tagged on creation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html#spot-instance-no-tag>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

    :type maxResults: integer
    :param maxResults: 

      The maximum number of results returned by ``DescribeJobDefinitions`` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ``DescribeJobDefinitions`` only returns ``maxResults`` results in a single page and a ``nextToken`` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ``DescribeJobDefinitions`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then ``DescribeJobDefinitions`` returns up to 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.

      

    
    :type jobDefinitionName: string
    :param jobDefinitionName: 

      The name of the job definition to describe.

      

    
    :type status: string
    :param status: 

      The status used to filter job definitions.

      

    
    :type nextToken: string
    :param nextToken: 

      The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated ``DescribeJobDefinitions`` request where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.

                The image used to start a container. This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker Hub registry are available by default. Other repositories are specified with `` *repository-url* /*image* :*tag* `` . Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to ``Image`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``IMAGE`` parameter of `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  Docker image architecture must match the processor architecture of the compute resources that they're scheduled on. For example, ARM-based Docker images can only run on ARM-based compute resources.

                   

                 

                 
                * Images in Amazon ECR repositories use the full registry and repository URI (for example, ``012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>`` ). 
                 
                * Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, ``ubuntu`` or ``mongo`` ). 
                 
                * Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, ``amazon/amazon-ecs-agent`` ). 
                 
                * Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, ``quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu`` ). 
                 

                
              

              - **vcpus** *(integer) --* 

                The number of vCPUs reserved for the job. Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. This parameter maps to ``CpuShares`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--cpu-shares`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . The number of vCPUs must be specified but can be be specified in several places. You must specify it at least once for each node.

                 

                This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported for jobs that run on Fargate resources. For these resources, use ``resourceRequirement`` instead. You can use this parameter or ``resourceRequirements`` structure but not both.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided. For jobs that run on Fargate resources, you must specify the vCPU requirement for the job using ``resourceRequirements`` .

                   

                
              

              - **memory** *(integer) --* 

                This parameter indicates the memory hard limit (in MiB) for a container. If your container attempts to exceed the specified number, it is terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job using this parameter. The memory hard limit can be specified in several places. It must be specified for each node at least once.

                 

                This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--memory`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                 

                This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported on Fargate resources. For Fargate resources, you should specify the memory requirement using ``resourceRequirement`` . You can do this for EC2 resources.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see `Memory Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                   

                
              

              - **command** *(list) --* 

                The command that's passed to the container. This parameter maps to ``Cmd`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``COMMAND`` parameter to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . For more information, see `https\://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd>`__ .

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **jobRoleArn** *(string) --*

For more information, see `IAM Roles for Tasks <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                
              

              - **executionRoleArn** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution role that AWS Batch can assume. For jobs that run on Fargate resources, you must provide an execution role. For more information, see `AWS Batch execution IAM role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/execution-IAM-role.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                
              

              - **volumes** *(list) --* 

                A list of data volumes used in a job.

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A data volume used in a job's container properties.

                  
                  

                  - **host** *(dict) --* 

                    The contents of the ``host`` parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                       

                    
                    

                    - **sourcePath** *(string) --* 

                      The path on the host container instance that's presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If this parameter contains a file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the source path location doesn't exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that run on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                         

                      
                
                  

                  - **name** *(string) --* 

                    The name of the volume. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. This name is referenced in the ``sourceVolume`` parameter of container definition ``mountPoints`` .

                    
                  

                  - **efsVolumeConfiguration** *(dict) --*

                    - **fileSystemId** *(string) --* 

                      The Amazon EFS file system ID to use.

                      
                    

                    - **rootDirectory** *(string) --* 

                      The directory within the Amazon EFS file system to mount as the root directory inside the host. If this parameter is omitted, the root of the Amazon EFS volume will be used. Specifying ``/`` will have the same effect as omitting this parameter.

                       

                      .. warning::

                         

                        If an EFS access point is specified in the ``authorizationConfig`` , the root directory parameter must either be omitted or set to ``/`` which will enforce the path set on the Amazon EFS access point.

                         

                      
                    

                    - **transitEncryption** *(string) --* 

                      Whether or not to enable encryption for Amazon EFS data in transit between the Amazon ECS host and the Amazon EFS server. Transit encryption must be enabled if Amazon EFS IAM authorization is used. If this parameter is omitted, the default value of ``DISABLED`` is used. For more information, see `Encrypting data in transit <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/encryption-in-transit.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic File System User Guide* .

                        The Amazon EFS access point ID to use. If an access point is specified, the root directory value specified in the ``EFSVolumeConfiguration`` must either be omitted or set to ``/`` which will enforce the path set on the EFS access point. If an access point is used, transit encryption must be enabled in the ``EFSVolumeConfiguration`` . For more information, see `Working with Amazon EFS Access Points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic File System User Guide* .

                        
                      

                      - **iam** *(string) --* 

                        Whether or not to use the AWS Batch execution IAM role defined in a job definition when mounting the Amazon EFS file system. If enabled, transit encryption must be enabled in the ``EFSVolumeConfiguration`` . If this parameter is omitted, the default value of ``DISABLED`` is used.

                    This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                     

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    The container path, mount options, and size of the tmpfs mount.

                     

                    .. note::

                    - **containerPath** *(string) --* 

                      The absolute file path in the container where the tmpfs volume is mounted.

                      
                    

                    - **size** *(integer) --* 

                      The size (in MiB) of the tmpfs volume.

                      
                    

                    - **mountOptions** *(list) --* 

                      The list of tmpfs volume mount options.

                       

                      Valid values: "``defaults`` " | "``ro`` " | "``rw`` " | "``suid`` " | "``nosuid`` " | "``dev`` " | "``nodev`` " | "``exec`` " | "``noexec`` " | "``sync`` " | "``async`` " | "``dirsync`` " | "``remount`` " | "``mand`` " | "``nomand`` " | "``atime`` " | "``noatime`` " | "``diratime`` " | "``nodiratime`` " | "``bind`` " | "``rbind" | "unbindable" | "runbindable" | "private" | "rprivate" | "shared" | "rshared" | "slave" | "rslave" | "relatime`` " | "``norelatime`` " | "``strictatime`` " | "``nostrictatime`` " | "``mode`` " | "``uid`` " | "``gid`` " | "``nr_inodes`` " | "``nr_blocks`` " | "``mpol`` "

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
              
                

                - **maxSwap** *(integer) --* 

                  The total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This parameter is translated to the ``--memory-swap`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ where the value is the sum of the container memory plus the ``maxSwap`` value. For more information, see ` ``--memory-swap`` details <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#--memory-swap-details>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                   

                  If a ``maxSwap`` value of ``0`` is specified, the container doesn't use swap. Accepted values are ``0`` or any positive integer. If the ``maxSwap`` parameter is omitted, the container doesn't use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A ``maxSwap`` value must be set for the ``swappiness`` parameter to be used.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                     

                  
                

                - **swappiness** *(integer) --* 

                  This allows you to tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. A ``swappiness`` value of ``0`` causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A ``swappiness`` value of ``100`` causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between ``0`` and ``100`` . If the ``swappiness`` parameter isn't specified, a default value of ``60`` is used. If a value isn't specified for ``maxSwap`` then this parameter is ignored. If ``maxSwap`` is set to 0, the container doesn't use swap. This parameter maps to the ``--memory-swappiness`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                   

                  Consider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.

                   

                   
                  * Swap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for the containers to use. 

                  .. note::

                     The Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don't have swap enabled by default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more information, see `Instance Store Swap Volumes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-store-swap-volumes.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* or `How do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file? <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-memory-swap-file/>`__   

                   
                   
                  * The swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using EC2 resources. 
                   
                  * If the ``maxSwap`` and ``swappiness`` parameters are omitted from a job definition, each container will have a default ``swappiness`` value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited to two times the memory reservation of the container. 
                   

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                     

                  
            
              

              - **logConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                The log configuration specification for the container.

                 

                This parameter maps to ``LogConfig`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--log-driver`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see `Configure logging drivers <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  AWS Batch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the  LogConfiguration data type).

                   

                 

                This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see `Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                   

                
                

                - **logDriver** *(string) --* 

                  The log driver to use for the container. The valid values listed for this parameter are log drivers that the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by default.

                   

                  The supported log drivers are ``awslogs`` , ``fluentd`` , ``gelf`` , ``json-file`` , ``journald`` , ``logentries`` , ``syslog`` , and ``splunk`` .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Jobs running on Fargate resources are restricted to the ``awslogs`` and ``splunk`` log drivers.

                     

                    awslogs  

                  Specifies the Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver.

                    fluentd  

                  Specifies the Fluentd logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Fluentd logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/fluentd/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    gelf  

                  Specifies the Graylog Extended Format (GELF) logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Graylog Extended Format logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/gelf/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    journald  

                  Specifies the journald logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Journald logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/journald/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    json-file  

                  Specifies the JSON file logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `JSON File logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    splunk  

                  Specifies the Splunk logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Splunk logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/splunk/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    syslog  

                  Specifies the syslog logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Syslog logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/syslog/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                     

                  .. note::

                     

                    If you have a custom driver that's not listed earlier that you want to work with the Amazon ECS container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that's `available on GitHub <https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent>`__ and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you want to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn't currently support running modified copies of this software.

                     

                   

                  This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance.

                - **assignPublicIp** *(string) --* 

                  Indicates whether the job should have a public IP address. For a job running on Fargate resources in a private subnet to send outbound traffic to the internet (for example, in order to pull container images), the private subnet requires a NAT gateway be attached to route requests to the internet. For more information, see `Amazon ECS task networking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html>`__ . The default value is "DISABLED".

                  
            
              

              - **fargatePlatformConfiguration** *(dict) --*

                - **platformVersion** *(string) --* 

                  The AWS Fargate platform version where the jobs are running. A platform version is specified only for jobs running on Fargate resources. If one isn't specified, the ``LATEST`` platform version is used by default. This uses a recent, approved version of the AWS Fargate platform for compute resources. For more information, see `AWS Fargate platform versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

              - **attemptDurationSeconds** *(integer) --* 

                The time duration in seconds (measured from the job attempt's ``startedAt`` timestamp) after which AWS Batch terminates your jobs if they have not finished. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds.

                
          
            

            - **nodeProperties** *(dict) --* 

              An object with various properties specific to multi-node parallel jobs.

               

              .. note::

                 

                If the job runs on Fargate resources, then you must not specify ``nodeProperties`` ; use ``containerProperties`` instead.

                 

              
              

              - **numNodes** *(integer) --* 

                The number of nodes associated with a multi-node parallel job.

                
              

              - **mainNode** *(integer) --* 

                Specifies the node index for the main node of a multi-node parallel job. This node index value must be fewer than the number of nodes.

                
              

              - **nodeRangeProperties** *(list) --* 

                A list of node ranges and their properties associated with a multi-node parallel job.

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  An object representing the properties of the node range for a multi-node parallel job.

                  
                  

                  - **targetNodes** *(string) --* 

                    The range of nodes, using node index values. A range of ``0:3`` indicates nodes with index values of ``0`` through ``3`` . If the starting range value is omitted (``:n`` ), then ``0`` is used to start the range. If the ending range value is omitted (``n:`` ), then the highest possible node index is used to end the range. Your accumulative node ranges must account for all nodes (``0:n`` ). You can nest node ranges, for example ``0:10`` and ``4:5`` , in which case the ``4:5`` range properties override the ``0:10`` properties.

                    
                  

                  - **container** *(dict) --*

                      The image used to start a container. This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker Hub registry are available by default. Other repositories are specified with `` *repository-url* /*image* :*tag* `` . Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to ``Image`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``IMAGE`` parameter of `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        Docker image architecture must match the processor architecture of the compute resources that they're scheduled on. For example, ARM-based Docker images can only run on ARM-based compute resources.

                      * Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, ``ubuntu`` or ``mongo`` ). 
                       
                      * Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, ``amazon/amazon-ecs-agent`` ). 
                       
                      * Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, ``quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu`` ). 
                       

                      
                    

                    - **vcpus** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of vCPUs reserved for the job. Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares.

The number of vCPUs must be specified but can be be specified in several places. You must specify it at least once for each node.

                       

                      This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported for jobs that run on Fargate resources. For these resources, use ``resourceRequirement`` instead. You can use this parameter or ``resourceRequirements`` structure but not both.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided. For jobs that run on Fargate resources, you must specify the vCPU requirement for the job using ``resourceRequirements`` .

                      This parameter indicates the memory hard limit (in MiB) for a container. If your container attempts to exceed the specified number, it is terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job using this parameter. The memory hard limit can be specified in several places. It must be specified for each node at least once.

                       

                      This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--memory`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                       

                      This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported on Fargate resources. For Fargate resources, you should specify the memory requirement using ``resourceRequirement`` . You can do this for EC2 resources.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see `Memory Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                         

                      
                    

                    - **command** *(list) --* 

                      The command that's passed to the container. This parameter maps to ``Cmd`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``COMMAND`` parameter to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                    - **volumes** *(list) --* 

                      A list of data volumes used in a job.

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A data volume used in a job's container properties.

                        
                        

                        - **host** *(dict) --* 

                          The contents of the ``host`` parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.

                           

                          .. note::

                             

                            This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                            The path on the host container instance that's presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If this parameter contains a file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the source path location doesn't exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.

                             

                            .. note::

                            The directory within the Amazon EFS file system to mount as the root directory inside the host. If this parameter is omitted, the root of the Amazon EFS volume will be used. Specifying ``/`` will have the same effect as omitting this parameter.

                             

                            .. warning::

                               

                              If an EFS access point is specified in the ``authorizationConfig`` , the root directory parameter must either be omitted or set to ``/`` which will enforce the path set on the Amazon EFS access point.

                            The size (in MiB) of the tmpfs volume.

                            
                          

                          - **mountOptions** *(list) --* 

                            The list of tmpfs volume mount options.

                             

                            Valid values: "``defaults`` " | "``ro`` " | "``rw`` " | "``suid`` " | "``nosuid`` " | "``dev`` " | "``nodev`` " | "``exec`` " | "``noexec`` " | "``sync`` " | "``async`` " | "``dirsync`` " | "``remount`` " | "``mand`` " | "``nomand`` " | "``atime`` " | "``noatime`` " | "``diratime`` " | "``nodiratime`` " | "``bind`` " | "``rbind" | "unbindable" | "runbindable" | "private" | "rprivate" | "shared" | "rshared" | "slave" | "rslave" | "relatime`` " | "``norelatime`` " | "``strictatime`` " | "``nostrictatime`` " | "``mode`` " | "``uid`` " | "``gid`` " | "``nr_inodes`` " | "``nr_blocks`` " | "``mpol`` "

                            
                            

                            - *(string) --* 
                        
                      
                    
                      

                      - **maxSwap** *(integer) --* 

                        The total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This parameter is translated to the ``--memory-swap`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ where the value is the sum of the container memory plus the ``maxSwap`` value. For more information, see ` ``--memory-swap`` details <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#--memory-swap-details>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                         

                        If a ``maxSwap`` value of ``0`` is specified, the container doesn't use swap. Accepted values are ``0`` or any positive integer. If the ``maxSwap`` parameter is omitted, the container doesn't use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A ``maxSwap`` value must be set for the ``swappiness`` parameter to be used.

                         

                        .. note::

                           

                          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                           

                        
                      

                      - **swappiness** *(integer) --* 

                        This allows you to tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. A ``swappiness`` value of ``0`` causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A ``swappiness`` value of ``100`` causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between ``0`` and ``100`` . If the ``swappiness`` parameter isn't specified, a default value of ``60`` is used. If a value isn't specified for ``maxSwap`` then this parameter is ignored. If ``maxSwap`` is set to 0, the container doesn't use swap. This parameter maps to the ``--memory-swappiness`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                         

                        Consider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.

                         

                         
                        * Swap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for the containers to use. 

                        .. note::

                           The Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don't have swap enabled by default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more information, see `Instance Store Swap Volumes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-store-swap-volumes.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* or `How do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file? <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-memory-swap-file/>`__   

                         
                         
                        * The swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using EC2 resources. 
                         
                        * If the ``maxSwap`` and ``swappiness`` parameters are omitted from a job definition, each container will have a default ``swappiness`` value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited to two times the memory reservation of the container. 
                         

                         

                        .. note::

                           

                          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                           

                        
                  
                    

                    - **logConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                      The log configuration specification for the container.

                       

                      This parameter maps to ``LogConfig`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--log-driver`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see `Configure logging drivers <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        AWS Batch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the  LogConfiguration data type).

                         

                       

                      This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see `Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                         

                      
                      

                      - **logDriver** *(string) --* 

                        The log driver to use for the container. The valid values listed for this parameter are log drivers that the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by default.

                         

                        The supported log drivers are ``awslogs`` , ``fluentd`` , ``gelf`` , ``json-file`` , ``journald`` , ``logentries`` , ``syslog`` , and ``splunk`` .

                         

                        .. note::

                           

                          Jobs running on Fargate resources are restricted to the ``awslogs`` and ``splunk`` log drivers.

                           

                          awslogs

                        .. note::

                           

                          If you have a custom driver that's not listed earlier that you want to work with the Amazon ECS container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that's `available on GitHub <https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent>`__ and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you want to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn't currently support running modified copies of this software.

                           

                         

                        This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

                        
                      

                      - **options** *(dict) --* 

                        The configuration options to send to the log driver. This parameter requires version 1.19 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance.

                    - **networkConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                      The network configuration for jobs running on Fargate resources. Jobs running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.

                      
                      

                      - **assignPublicIp** *(string) --* 

                        Indicates whether the job should have a public IP address. For a job running on Fargate resources in a private subnet to send outbound traffic to the internet (for example, in order to pull container images), the private subnet requires a NAT gateway be attached to route requests to the internet. For more information, see `Amazon ECS task networking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html>`__ . The default value is "DISABLED".

                      The platform configuration for jobs running on Fargate resources. Jobs running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.

                      
                      

                      - **platformVersion** *(string) --* 

                        The AWS Fargate platform version where the jobs are running. A platform version is specified only for jobs running on Fargate resources. If one isn't specified, the ``LATEST`` platform version is used by default. This uses a recent, approved version of the AWS Fargate platform for compute resources. For more information, see `AWS Fargate platform versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                        
                  
                
              
            
          
            

            - **tags** *(dict) --* 

              The tags applied to the job definition.

            - **propagateTags** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job definition to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task creation. For tags with the same name, job tags are given priority over job definitions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the ``FAILED`` state.

              
            

            - **platformCapabilities** *(list) --* 

              The platform capabilities required by the job definition. If no value is specified, it defaults to ``EC2`` . Jobs run on Fargate resources specify ``FARGATE`` .

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
        
      
        

        - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

          The ``nextToken`` value to include in a future ``DescribeJobDefinitions`` request. When the results of a ``DescribeJobDefinitions`` request exceed ``maxResults`` , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of results. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.

      A list of up to 100 queue names or full queue Amazon Resource Name (ARN) entries.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type maxResults: integer
    :param maxResults: 

      The maximum number of results returned by ``DescribeJobQueues`` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ``DescribeJobQueues`` only returns ``maxResults`` results in a single page and a ``nextToken`` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ``DescribeJobQueues`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then ``DescribeJobQueues`` returns up to 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.

      

    
    :type nextToken: string
    :param nextToken: 

      The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated ``DescribeJobQueues`` request where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.

       

      .. note::

         

        This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **jobQueues** *(list) --* 

          The list of job queues.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            An object representing the details of an AWS Batch job queue.

            
            

            - **jobQueueName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the job queue.

              
            

            - **jobQueueArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.

              
            

            - **state** *(string) --* 

              Describes the ability of the queue to accept new jobs. If the job queue state is ``ENABLED`` , it's able to accept jobs. If the job queue state is ``DISABLED`` , new jobs can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.

              
            

            - **status** *(string) --* 

              The status of the job queue (for example, ``CREATING`` or ``VALID`` ).

              
            

            - **statusReason** *(string) --* 

              A short, human-readable string to provide additional details about the current status of the job queue.

              
            

            - **priority** *(integer) --* 

              The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the ``priority`` parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order, for example, a job queue with a priority value of ``10`` is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of ``1`` . All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (``EC2`` or ``SPOT`` ) or Fargate (``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

              
            

            - **computeEnvironmentOrder** *(list) --* 

              The compute environments that are attached to the job queue and the order that job placement is preferred. Compute environments are selected for job placement in ascending order.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                The order in which compute environments are tried for job placement within a queue. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried for job placement first. Compute environments must be in the ``VALID`` state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (``EC2`` or ``SPOT`` ) or Fargate (``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. AWS Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.

                   

                
                

                - **order** *(integer) --* 

                  The order of the compute environment. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower ``order`` integer value is tried for job placement first.

                  
                

                - **computeEnvironment** *(string) --* 

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.

                  
            
          
            

            - **tags** *(dict) --* 

              The tags applied to the job queue. For more information, see `Tagging your AWS Batch resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using-tags.html>`__ in *AWS Batch User Guide* .

              
              

              - *(string) --*

        - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

          The ``nextToken`` value to include in a future ``DescribeJobQueues`` request. When the results of a ``DescribeJobQueues`` request exceed ``maxResults`` , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of results. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.

                  A data volume used in a job's container properties.

                  
                  

                  - **host** *(dict) --* 

                    The contents of the ``host`` parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                      The path on the host container instance that's presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If this parameter contains a file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the source path location doesn't exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.

                       

                      .. note::

                  If true, run an ``init`` process inside the container that forwards signals and reaps processes. This parameter maps to the ``--init`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . This parameter requires version 1.25 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

                  
                

                - **sharedMemorySize** *(integer) --* 

                  The value for the size (in MiB) of the ``/dev/shm`` volume. This parameter maps to the ``--shm-size`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                   

                  .. note::

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
              
                

                - **maxSwap** *(integer) --* 

                  The total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This parameter is translated to the ``--memory-swap`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ where the value is the sum of the container memory plus the ``maxSwap`` value. For more information, see ` ``--memory-swap`` details <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#--memory-swap-details>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                   

                  If a ``maxSwap`` value of ``0`` is specified, the container doesn't use swap. Accepted values are ``0`` or any positive integer. If the ``maxSwap`` parameter is omitted, the container doesn't use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A ``maxSwap`` value must be set for the ``swappiness`` parameter to be used.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                     

                  
                

                - **swappiness** *(integer) --* 

                  This allows you to tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. A ``swappiness`` value of ``0`` causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A ``swappiness`` value of ``100`` causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between ``0`` and ``100`` . If the ``swappiness`` parameter isn't specified, a default value of ``60`` is used. If a value isn't specified for ``maxSwap`` then this parameter is ignored. If ``maxSwap`` is set to 0, the container doesn't use swap. This parameter maps to the ``--memory-swappiness`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                   

                  Consider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.

                   

                   
                  * Swap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for the containers to use. 

                  .. note::

                     The Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don't have swap enabled by default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more information, see `Instance Store Swap Volumes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-store-swap-volumes.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* or `How do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file? <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-memory-swap-file/>`__   

                   
                   
                  * The swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using EC2 resources. 
                   
                  * If the ``maxSwap`` and ``swappiness`` parameters are omitted from a job definition, each container will have a default ``swappiness`` value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited to two times the memory reservation of the container. 
                   

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                     

                  
            
              

              - **logConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                The log configuration specification for the container.

                 

                This parameter maps to ``LogConfig`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--log-driver`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However, the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance. Or, alternatively, it must be configured on a different log server for remote logging options. For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see `Configure logging drivers <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  AWS Batch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the  LogConfiguration data type). Additional log drivers might be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent.

                   

                 

                This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see `Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                   

                
                

                - **logDriver** *(string) --* 

                  The log driver to use for the container. The valid values listed for this parameter are log drivers that the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by default.

                   

                  The supported log drivers are ``awslogs`` , ``fluentd`` , ``gelf`` , ``json-file`` , ``journald`` , ``logentries`` , ``syslog`` , and ``splunk`` .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Jobs running on Fargate resources are restricted to the ``awslogs`` and ``splunk`` log drivers.

                     

                    awslogs  

                  Specifies the Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver. For more information, see `Using the awslogs Log Driver <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using_awslogs.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* and `Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/awslogs/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    fluentd  

                  Specifies the Fluentd logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Fluentd logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/fluentd/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    gelf  

                  Specifies the Graylog Extended Format (GELF) logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Graylog Extended Format logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/gelf/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    journald  

                  Specifies the journald logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Journald logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/journald/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    json-file  

                  Specifies the JSON file logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `JSON File logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    splunk  

                  Specifies the Splunk logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Splunk logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/splunk/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    syslog  

                  Specifies the syslog logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Syslog logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/syslog/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                     

                  .. note::

                     

                    If you have a custom driver that's not listed earlier that you want to work with the Amazon ECS container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that's `available on GitHub <https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent>`__ and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you want to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn't currently support running modified copies of this software.

                     

                   

                  This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance.

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    An object representing the secret to expose to your container. Secrets can be exposed to a container in the following ways:

                     

                     
                    * To inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables, use the ``secrets`` container definition parameter. 
                     
                    * To reference sensitive information in the log configuration of a container, use the ``secretOptions`` container definition parameter. 
                     

                     

                    For more information, see `Specifying sensitive data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/specifying-sensitive-data.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                  An object representing the secret to expose to your container. Secrets can be exposed to a container in the following ways:

                   

                   
                  * To inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables, use the ``secrets`` container definition parameter. 
                   
                  * To reference sensitive information in the log configuration of a container, use the ``secretOptions`` container definition parameter. 
                   

                   

                  For more information, see `Specifying sensitive data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/specifying-sensitive-data.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                  
                  

                  - **name** *(string) --* 

                    The name of the secret.

                    
                  

                  - **valueFrom** *(string) --* 

                    The secret to expose to the container. The supported values are either the full ARN of the AWS Secrets Manager secret or the full ARN of the parameter in the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      If the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the job you're launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.

                       

                    
              
            
              

              - **networkConfiguration** *(dict) --*

                  - **targetNodes** *(string) --* 

                    The range of nodes, using node index values. A range of ``0:3`` indicates nodes with index values of ``0`` through ``3`` . If the starting range value is omitted (``:n`` ), then ``0`` is used to start the range. If the ending range value is omitted (``n:`` ), then the highest possible node index is used to end the range. Your accumulative node ranges must account for all nodes (``0:n`` ). You can nest node ranges, for example ``0:10`` and ``4:5`` , in which case the ``4:5`` range properties override the ``0:10`` properties.

                    
                  

                  - **container** *(dict) --*

This parameter maps to ``Image`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``IMAGE`` parameter of `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        Docker image architecture must match the processor architecture of the compute resources that they're scheduled on. For example, ARM-based Docker images can only run on ARM-based compute resources.

                         

                       

                       
                      * Images in Amazon ECR repositories use the full registry and repository URI (for example, ``012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>`` ). 
                       
                      * Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, ``ubuntu`` or ``mongo`` ). 
                       
                      * Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, ``amazon/amazon-ecs-agent`` ). 
                       
                      * Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, ``quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu`` ). 
                       

                      
                    

                    - **vcpus** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of vCPUs reserved for the job. Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. This parameter maps to ``CpuShares`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--cpu-shares`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . The number of vCPUs must be specified but can be be specified in several places. You must specify it at least once for each node.

                       

                      This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported for jobs that run on Fargate resources. For these resources, use ``resourceRequirement`` instead. You can use this parameter or ``resourceRequirements`` structure but not both.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided. For jobs that run on Fargate resources, you must specify the vCPU requirement for the job using ``resourceRequirements`` .

                         

                      
                    

                    - **memory** *(integer) --* 

                      This parameter indicates the memory hard limit (in MiB) for a container. If your container attempts to exceed the specified number, it is terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job using this parameter. The memory hard limit can be specified in several places. It must be specified for each node at least once.

                       

                      This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--memory`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                       

                      This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported on Fargate resources. For Fargate resources, you should specify the memory requirement using ``resourceRequirement`` . You can do this for EC2 resources.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see `Memory Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A data volume used in a job's container properties.

                        
                        

                        - **host** *(dict) --* 

                          The contents of the ``host`` parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.

                           

                          .. note::

                             

                            This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                             

                          
                          

                          - **sourcePath** *(string) --* 

                            The path on the host container instance that's presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If this parameter contains a file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the source path location doesn't exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.

                             

                            .. note::

                            The directory within the Amazon EFS file system to mount as the root directory inside the host. If this parameter is omitted, the root of the Amazon EFS volume will be used. Specifying ``/`` will have the same effect as omitting this parameter.

                             

                            .. warning::

                               

                              If an EFS access point is specified in the ``authorizationConfig`` , the root directory parameter must either be omitted or set to ``/`` which will enforce the path set on the Amazon EFS access point.

                            This object isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                             

                          
                          

                          - **hostPath** *(string) --* 

                            The path for the device on the host container instance.

                            
                          

                          - **containerPath** *(string) --* 

                            The path inside the container used to expose the host device. By default, the ``hostPath`` value is used.

                            
                          

                          - **permissions** *(list) --* 

                            The explicit permissions to provide to the container for the device. By default, the container has permissions for ``read`` , ``write`` , and ``mknod`` for the device.

                      - **initProcessEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

                        If true, run an ``init`` process inside the container that forwards signals and reaps processes. This parameter maps to the ``--init`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . This parameter requires version 1.25 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

                        
                      

                      - **sharedMemorySize** *(integer) --* 

                        The value for the size (in MiB) of the ``/dev/shm`` volume. This parameter maps to the ``--shm-size`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                         

                        .. note::

                           

                          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                           

                        
                      

                      - **tmpfs** *(list) --* 

                        The container path, mount options, and size (in MiB) of the tmpfs mount. This parameter maps to the ``--tmpfs`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                         

                        .. note::

                           

                          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                           

                        
                        

                        - *(dict) --* 

                          The container path, mount options, and size of the tmpfs mount.

                           

                          .. note::

                             

                            This object isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources.

                             

                          
                          

                          - **containerPath** *(string) --* 

                            The absolute file path in the container where the tmpfs volume is mounted.

                            
                          

                          - **size** *(integer) --* 

                            The size (in MiB) of the tmpfs volume.

                            
                          

                          - **mountOptions** *(list) --* 

                            The list of tmpfs volume mount options.

                             

                            Valid values: "``defaults`` " | "``ro`` " | "``rw`` " | "``suid`` " | "``nosuid`` " | "``dev`` " | "``nodev`` " | "``exec`` " | "``noexec`` " | "``sync`` " | "``async`` " | "``dirsync`` " | "``remount`` " | "``mand`` " | "``nomand`` " | "``atime`` " | "``noatime`` " | "``diratime`` " | "``nodiratime`` " | "``bind`` " | "``rbind" | "unbindable" | "runbindable" | "private" | "rprivate" | "shared" | "rshared" | "slave" | "rslave" | "relatime`` " | "``norelatime`` " | "``strictatime`` " | "``nostrictatime`` " | "``mode`` " | "``uid`` " | "``gid`` " | "``nr_inodes`` " | "``nr_blocks`` " | "``mpol`` "

                            
                            

                            - *(string) --* 
                        
                      
                    
                      

                      - **maxSwap** *(integer) --* 

                        The total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This parameter is translated to the ``--memory-swap`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ where the value is the sum of the container memory plus the ``maxSwap`` value. For more information, see ` ``--memory-swap`` details <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#--memory-swap-details>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                         

                        If a ``maxSwap`` value of ``0`` is specified, the container doesn't use swap. Accepted values are ``0`` or any positive integer. If the ``maxSwap`` parameter is omitted, the container doesn't use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A ``maxSwap`` value must be set for the ``swappiness`` parameter to be used.

                         

                        .. note::

                           

                          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                           

                        
                      

                      - **swappiness** *(integer) --* 

                        This allows you to tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. A ``swappiness`` value of ``0`` causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A ``swappiness`` value of ``100`` causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between ``0`` and ``100`` . If the ``swappiness`` parameter isn't specified, a default value of ``60`` is used. If a value isn't specified for ``maxSwap`` then this parameter is ignored. If ``maxSwap`` is set to 0, the container doesn't use swap. This parameter maps to the ``--memory-swappiness`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                         

                        Consider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.

                         

                         
                        * Swap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for the containers to use. 

                        .. note::

                           The Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don't have swap enabled by default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more information, see `Instance Store Swap Volumes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-store-swap-volumes.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* or `How do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file? <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-memory-swap-file/>`__   

                         
                         
                        * The swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using EC2 resources. 
                         
                        * If the ``maxSwap`` and ``swappiness`` parameters are omitted from a job definition, each container will have a default ``swappiness`` value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited to two times the memory reservation of the container. 
                         

                         

                        .. note::

                           

                          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                           

                        
                  
                    

                    - **logConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                      The log configuration specification for the container.

                       

                      This parameter maps to ``LogConfig`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--log-driver`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see `Configure logging drivers <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        AWS Batch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the  LogConfiguration data type).

                         

                       

                      This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see `Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                         

                      
                      

                      - **logDriver** *(string) --* 

                        The log driver to use for the container. The valid values listed for this parameter are log drivers that the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by default.

                         

                        The supported log drivers are ``awslogs`` , ``fluentd`` , ``gelf`` , ``json-file`` , ``journald`` , ``logentries`` , ``syslog`` , and ``splunk`` .

                         

                        .. note::

                           

                          Jobs running on Fargate resources are restricted to the ``awslogs`` and ``splunk`` log drivers.

                           

                          awslogs  

                        Specifies the Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver.

                        .. note::

                           

                          If you have a custom driver that's not listed earlier that you want to work with the Amazon ECS container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that's `available on GitHub <https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent>`__ and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you want to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn't currently support running modified copies of this software.

                           

                         

                        This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

                        
                      

                      - **options** *(dict) --* 

                        The configuration options to send to the log driver. This parameter requires version 1.19 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance.

  .. py:method:: generate_presigned_url(ClientMethod, Params=None, ExpiresIn=3600, HttpMethod=None)

        
    Generate a presigned url given a client, its method, and arguments
    
    :type ClientMethod: string
    :param ClientMethod: The client method to presign for
    
    :type Params: dict
    :param Params: The parameters normally passed to
        ``ClientMethod``.
    
    :type ExpiresIn: int
    :param ExpiresIn: The number of seconds the presigned url is valid
        for. By default it expires in an hour (3600 seconds)
    
    :type HttpMethod: string
    :param HttpMethod: The http method to use on the generated url. By
        default, the http method is whatever is used in the method's model.

  .. py:method:: get_paginator(operation_name)

        
    Create a paginator for an operation.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :raise OperationNotPageableError: Raised if the operation is not
        pageable.  You can use the ``client.can_paginate`` method to
        check if an operation is pageable.
    
    :rtype: L{botocore.paginate.Paginator}
    :return: A paginator object.


  .. py:method:: get_waiter(waiter_name)

        
    Returns an object that can wait for some condition.
    
    :type waiter_name: str
    :param waiter_name: The name of the waiter to get. See the waiters
        section of the service docs for a list of available waiters.
    
    :returns: The specified waiter object.
    :rtype: botocore.waiter.Waiter


  .. py:method:: list_jobs(**kwargs)

    

    Returns a list of AWS Batch jobs.

     

    You must specify only one of the following items:

     

     
    * A job queue ID to return a list of jobs in that job queue 
     
    * A multi-node parallel job ID to return a list of nodes for that job 
     
    * An array job ID to return a list of the children for that job 
     

     

    You can filter the results by job status with the ``jobStatus`` parameter. If you don't specify a status, only ``RUNNING`` jobs are returned.

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.list_jobs(
          jobQueue='string',
          arrayJobId='string',
          multiNodeJobId='string',
          jobStatus='SUBMITTED'|'PENDING'|'RUNNABLE'|'STARTING'|'RUNNING'|'SUCCEEDED'|'FAILED',
          maxResults=123,
          nextToken='string'
      )
    :type jobQueue: string
    :param jobQueue: 

      The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue used to list jobs.

      

    
    :type arrayJobId: string
    :param arrayJobId: 

      The job ID for an array job. Specifying an array job ID with this parameter lists all child jobs from within the specified array.

      

    
    :type multiNodeJobId: string
    :param multiNodeJobId: 

      The job ID for a multi-node parallel job. Specifying a multi-node parallel job ID with this parameter lists all nodes that are associated with the specified job.

      

    
    :type jobStatus: string
    :param jobStatus: 

      The job status used to filter jobs in the specified queue. If you don't specify a status, only ``RUNNING`` jobs are returned.

      

    
    :type maxResults: integer
    :param maxResults: 

      The maximum number of results returned by ``ListJobs`` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ``ListJobs`` only returns ``maxResults`` results in a single page and a ``nextToken`` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ``ListJobs`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then ``ListJobs`` returns up to 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.

      

    
    :type nextToken: string
    :param nextToken: 

      The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated ``ListJobs`` request where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.

       

      .. note::

         

        This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

      The type of job definition. For more information about multi-node parallel jobs, see `Creating a multi-node parallel job definition <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/multi-node-job-def.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

       

      .. note::

         

        If the job is run on Fargate resources, then ``multinode`` isn't supported.

         

      

    
    :type parameters: dict
    :param parameters: 

      Default parameter substitution placeholders to set in the job definition. Parameters are specified as a key-value pair mapping. Parameters in a ``SubmitJob`` request override any corresponding parameter defaults from the job definition.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
  

    :type containerProperties: dict
    :param containerProperties: 

      An object with various properties specific to single-node container-based jobs. If the job definition's ``type`` parameter is ``container`` , then you must specify either ``containerProperties`` or ``nodeProperties`` .

       

      .. note::

         

        If the job runs on Fargate resources, then you must not specify ``nodeProperties`` ; use only ``containerProperties`` .

         

      

    
      - **image** *(string) --* 

        The image used to start a container. This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker Hub registry are available by default. Other repositories are specified with `` *repository-url* /*image* :*tag* `` . Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to ``Image`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``IMAGE`` parameter of `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

         

        .. note::

           

          Docker image architecture must match the processor architecture of the compute resources that they're scheduled on. For example, ARM-based Docker images can only run on ARM-based compute resources.

           

         

         
        * Images in Amazon ECR repositories use the full registry and repository URI (for example, ``012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>`` ). 
         
        * Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, ``ubuntu`` or ``mongo`` ). 
         
        * Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, ``amazon/amazon-ecs-agent`` ). 
         
        * Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, ``quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu`` ). 
         

        

      
      - **vcpus** *(integer) --* 

        The number of vCPUs reserved for the job. Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. This parameter maps to ``CpuShares`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--cpu-shares`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . The number of vCPUs must be specified but can be be specified in several places. You must specify it at least once for each node.

         

        This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported for jobs that run on Fargate resources. For these resources, use ``resourceRequirement`` instead. You can use this parameter or ``resourceRequirements`` structure but not both.

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided. For jobs that run on Fargate resources, you must specify the vCPU requirement for the job using ``resourceRequirements`` .

           

        

      
      - **memory** *(integer) --* 

        This parameter indicates the memory hard limit (in MiB) for a container. If your container attempts to exceed the specified number, it is terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job using this parameter. The memory hard limit can be specified in several places. It must be specified for each node at least once.

         

        This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--memory`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

         

        This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported on Fargate resources. For Fargate resources, you should specify the memory requirement using ``resourceRequirement`` . You can do this for EC2 resources.

         

        .. note::

           

          If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see `Memory Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

          - **host** *(dict) --* 

            The contents of the ``host`` parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.

             

            .. note::

               

              This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

               

            

          
            - **sourcePath** *(string) --* 

              The path on the host container instance that's presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If this parameter contains a file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the source path location doesn't exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.

               

              .. note::

                 

                This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that run on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

            - **rootDirectory** *(string) --* 

              The directory within the Amazon EFS file system to mount as the root directory inside the host. If this parameter is omitted, the root of the Amazon EFS volume will be used. Specifying ``/`` will have the same effect as omitting this parameter.

               

              .. warning::

                 

                If an EFS access point is specified in the ``authorizationConfig`` , the root directory parameter must either be omitted or set to ``/`` which will enforce the path set on the Amazon EFS access point.

                 

              

            
            - **transitEncryption** *(string) --*

             ``VCPU`` = 2 or 4

              value = 17408, 18432, 19456, 20480, 21504, 22528, 23552, 24576, 25600, 26624, 27648, 28672, 29696, or 30720  

             ``VCPU`` = 4

                type="VCPU"  

            The number of vCPUs reserved for the container. This parameter maps to ``CpuShares`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--cpu-shares`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. For EC2 resources, you must specify at least one vCPU. This is required but can be specified in several places; it must be specified for each node at least once.

             

            For jobs running on Fargate resources, then ``value`` must match one of the supported values and the ``MEMORY`` values must be one of the values supported for that VCPU value. The supported values are 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4

              value = 0.25  

             ``MEMORY`` = 512, 1024, or 2048

              value = 0.5

This parameter maps to ``Devices`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--device`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

           

          .. note::

             

            This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

             

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            An object representing a container instance host device.

             

            .. note::

               

              This object isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

               

            

          
            - **hostPath** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The path for the device on the host container instance.

              

            
            - **containerPath** *(string) --* 

              The path inside the container used to expose the host device. By default, the ``hostPath`` value is used.

              

            
            - **permissions** *(list) --* 

              The explicit permissions to provide to the container for the device. By default, the container has permissions for ``read`` , ``write`` , and ``mknod`` for the device.

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
          
          
      
        - **initProcessEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

          If true, run an ``init`` process inside the container that forwards signals and reaps processes. This parameter maps to the ``--init`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . This parameter requires version 1.25 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``

        - **maxSwap** *(integer) --* 

          The total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This parameter is translated to the ``--memory-swap`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ where the value is the sum of the container memory plus the ``maxSwap`` value. For more information, see ` ``--memory-swap`` details <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#--memory-swap-details>`__ in the Docker documentation.

           

          If a ``maxSwap`` value of ``0`` is specified, the container doesn't use swap. Accepted values are ``0`` or any positive integer. If the ``maxSwap`` parameter is omitted, the container doesn't use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A ``maxSwap`` value must be set for the ``swappiness`` parameter to be used.

           

          .. note::

             

            This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

             

          

        
        - **swappiness** *(integer) --* 

          This allows you to tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. A ``swappiness`` value of ``0`` causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A ``swappiness`` value of ``100`` causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between ``0`` and ``100`` . If the ``swappiness`` parameter isn't specified, a default value of ``60`` is used. If a value isn't specified for ``maxSwap`` then this parameter is ignored. If ``maxSwap`` is set to 0, the container doesn't use swap. This parameter maps to the ``--memory-swappiness`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

           

          Consider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.

           

           
          * Swap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for the containers to use. 

          .. note::

             The Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don't have swap enabled by default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more information, see `Instance Store Swap Volumes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-store-swap-volumes.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* or `How do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file? <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-memory-swap-file/>`__   

           
           
          * The swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using EC2 resources. 
           
          * If the ``maxSwap`` and ``swappiness`` parameters are omitted from a job definition, each container will have a default ``swappiness`` value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited to two times the memory reservation of the container. 
           

           

          .. note::

             

            This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

             

          

        
      
      - **logConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        The log configuration specification for the container.

         

        This parameter maps to ``LogConfig`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--log-driver`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see `Configure logging drivers <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

         

        .. note::

           

          AWS Batch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the  LogConfiguration data type).

           

         

        This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

         

        .. note::

           

          The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see `Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

           

        

      
        - **logDriver** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

          .. note::

             

            If you have a custom driver that's not listed earlier that you want to work with the Amazon ECS container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that's `available on GitHub <https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent>`__ and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you want to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn't currently support running modified copies of this software.

             

           

          This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

          

        
        - **options** *(dict) --*

      - **networkConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        The network configuration for jobs running on Fargate resources. Jobs running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.

        

      
        - **assignPublicIp** *(string) --* 

          Indicates whether the job should have a public IP address. For a job running on Fargate resources in a private subnet to send outbound traffic to the internet (for example, in order to pull container images), the private subnet requires a NAT gateway be attached to route requests to the internet. For more information, see `Amazon ECS task networking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html>`__ . The default value is "DISABLED".

          

        
      
      - **fargatePlatformConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        The platform configuration for jobs running on Fargate resources. Jobs running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.

          The AWS Fargate platform version where the jobs are running. A platform version is specified only for jobs running on Fargate resources. If one isn't specified, the ``LATEST`` platform version is used by default. This uses a recent, approved version of the AWS Fargate platform for compute resources. For more information, see `AWS Fargate platform versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

          

        
      
    
    :type nodeProperties: dict
    :param nodeProperties: 

      An object with various properties specific to multi-node parallel jobs. If you specify node properties for a job, it becomes a multi-node parallel job. For more information, see `Multi-node Parallel Jobs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/multi-node-parallel-jobs.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . If the job definition's ``type`` parameter is ``container`` , then you must specify either ``containerProperties`` or ``nodeProperties`` .

       

      .. note::

         

        If the job runs on Fargate resources, then you must not specify ``nodeProperties`` ; use ``containerProperties`` instead.

         

      

    
      - **numNodes** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The number of nodes associated with a multi-node parallel job.

        

      
      - **mainNode** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Specifies the node index for the main node of a multi-node parallel job. This node index value must be fewer than the number of nodes.

        

      
      - **nodeRangeProperties** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A list of node ranges and their properties associated with a multi-node parallel job.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          An object representing the properties of the node range for a multi-node parallel job.

          

        
          - **targetNodes** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The range of nodes, using node index values. A range of ``0:3`` indicates nodes with index values of ``0`` through ``3`` . If the starting range value is omitted (``:n`` ), then ``0`` is used to start the range. If the ending range value is omitted (``n:`` ), then the highest possible node index is used to end the range. Your accumulative node ranges must account for all nodes (``0:n`` ). You can nest node ranges, for example ``0:10`` and ``4:5`` , in which case the ``4:5`` range properties override the ``0:10`` properties.

            

          
          - **container** *(dict) --* 

            The container details for the node range.

            

          
            - **image** *(string) --* 

              The image used to start a container. This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker Hub registry are available by default. Other repositories are specified with `` *repository-url* /*image* :*tag* `` . Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to ``Image`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``IMAGE`` parameter of `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

               

              .. note::

                 

                Docker image architecture must match the processor architecture of the compute resources that they're scheduled on. For example, ARM-based Docker images can only run on ARM-based compute resources.

                 

               

               
              * Images in Amazon ECR repositories use the full registry and repository URI (for example, ``012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>`` ). 
               
              * Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, ``ubuntu`` or ``mongo`` ). 
               
              * Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, ``amazon/amazon-ecs-agent`` ). 
               
              * Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, ``quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu`` ). 
               

              

            
            - **vcpus** *(integer) --* 

              The number of vCPUs reserved for the job. Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. This parameter maps to ``CpuShares`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--cpu-shares`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . The number of vCPUs must be specified but can be be specified in several places. You must specify it at least once for each node.

               

              This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported for jobs that run on Fargate resources. For these resources, use ``resourceRequirement`` instead. You can use this parameter or ``resourceRequirements`` structure but not both.

               

              .. note::

                 

                This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided. For jobs that run on Fargate resources, you must specify the vCPU requirement for the job using ``resourceRequirements`` .

                 

              

            
            - **memory** *(integer) --* 

              This parameter indicates the memory hard limit (in MiB) for a container. If your container attempts to exceed the specified number, it is terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job using this parameter. The memory hard limit can be specified in several places. It must be specified for each node at least once.

               

              This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--memory`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

               

              This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported on Fargate resources. For Fargate resources, you should specify the memory requirement using ``resourceRequirement`` . You can do this for EC2 resources.

               

              .. note::

                 

                If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see `Memory Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                A data volume used in a job's container properties.

                

              
                - **host** *(dict) --* 

                  The contents of the ``host`` parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.

                   

                  .. note::

                    The path on the host container instance that's presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If this parameter contains a file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the source path location doesn't exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.

                     

                    .. note::

                  - **rootDirectory** *(string) --* 

                    The directory within the Amazon EFS file system to mount as the root directory inside the host. If this parameter is omitted, the root of the Amazon EFS volume will be used. Specifying ``/`` will have the same effect as omitting this parameter.

                     

                    .. warning::

                       

                      If an EFS access point is specified in the ``authorizationConfig`` , the root directory parameter must either be omitted or set to ``/`` which will enforce the path set on the Amazon EFS access point.

              - **swappiness** *(integer) --* 

                This allows you to tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. A ``swappiness`` value of ``0`` causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A ``swappiness`` value of ``100`` causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between ``0`` and ``100`` . If the ``swappiness`` parameter isn't specified, a default value of ``60`` is used. If a value isn't specified for ``maxSwap`` then this parameter is ignored. If ``maxSwap`` is set to 0, the container doesn't use swap. This parameter maps to the ``--memory-swappiness`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                 

                Consider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.

                 

                 
                * Swap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for the containers to use. 

                .. note::

                   The Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don't have swap enabled by default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more information, see `Instance Store Swap Volumes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-store-swap-volumes.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* or `How do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file? <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-memory-swap-file/>`__   

                 
                 
                * The swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using EC2 resources. 
                 
                * If the ``maxSwap`` and ``swappiness`` parameters are omitted from a job definition, each container will have a default ``swappiness`` value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited to two times the memory reservation of the container. 
                 

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                   

                

              
            
            - **logConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

              The log configuration specification for the container.

               

              This parameter maps to ``LogConfig`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--log-driver`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see `Configure logging drivers <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

               

              .. note::

                 

                AWS Batch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the  LogConfiguration data type).

                 

               

              This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

               

              .. note::

                 

                The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see `Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                 

              

            
              - **logDriver** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The log driver to use for the container. The valid values listed for this parameter are log drivers that the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by default.

                 

                The supported log drivers are ``awslogs`` , ``fluentd`` , ``gelf`` , ``json-file`` , ``journald`` , ``logentries`` , ``syslog`` , and ``splunk`` .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  Jobs running on Fargate resources are restricted to the ``awslogs`` and ``splunk`` log drivers.

                   

                  awslogs  

                Specifies the Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver. For more information, see `Using the awslogs Log Driver <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using_awslogs.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* and `Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/awslogs/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                  fluentd  

                Specifies the Fluentd logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Fluentd logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/fluentd/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                  gelf  

                Specifies the Graylog Extended Format (GELF) logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Graylog Extended Format logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/gelf/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                  journald  

                Specifies the journald logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Journald logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/journald/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                  json-file  

                Specifies the JSON file logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `JSON File logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                  splunk  

                Specifies the Splunk logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Splunk logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/splunk/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                  syslog  

                Specifies the syslog logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Syslog logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/syslog/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                   

                .. note::

                   

                  If you have a custom driver that's not listed earlier that you want to work with the Amazon ECS container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that's `available on GitHub <https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent>`__ and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you want to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn't currently support running modified copies of this software.

                   

                 

                This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

                

              
              - **options** *(dict) --* 

                The configuration options to send to the log driver. This parameter requires version 1.19 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``

              - **platformVersion** *(string) --* 

                The AWS Fargate platform version where the jobs are running. A platform version is specified only for jobs running on Fargate resources. If one isn't specified, the ``LATEST`` platform version is used by default. This uses a recent, approved version of the AWS Fargate platform for compute resources. For more information, see `AWS Fargate platform versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                

              
            
          
        
    
    
    :type retryStrategy: dict
    :param retryStrategy: 

      The retry strategy to use for failed jobs that are submitted with this job definition. Any retry strategy that's specified during a  SubmitJob operation overrides the retry strategy defined here. If a job is terminated due to a timeout, it isn't retried.

      

    
      - **attempts** *(integer) --* 

        The number of times to move a job to the ``RUNNABLE`` status. You can specify between 1 and 10 attempts. If the value of ``attempts`` is greater than one, the job is retried on failure the same number of attempts as the value.

        

      
      - **evaluateOnExit** *(list) --* 

        Array of up to 5 objects that specify conditions under which the job should be retried or failed. If this parameter is specified, then the ``attempts`` parameter must also be specified.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Specifies a set of conditions to be met, and an action to take (``RETRY`` or ``EXIT`` ) if all conditions are met.

          

        
          - **onStatusReason** *(string) --* 

            Contains a glob pattern to match against the ``StatusReason`` returned for a job. The pattern can be up to 512 characters long, and can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), colons (:), and white space (including spaces or tabs). It can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.

            

          
          - **onReason** *(string) --* 

            Contains a glob pattern to match against the ``Reason`` returned for a job. The pattern can be up to 512 characters long, and can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), colons (:), and white space (including spaces and tabs). It can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.

            

          
          - **onExitCode** *(string) --* 

            Contains a glob pattern to match against the decimal representation of the ``ExitCode`` returned for a job. The pattern can be up to 512 characters long, can contain only numbers, and can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.

            

          
          - **action** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Specifies the action to take if all of the specified conditions (``onStatusReason`` , ``onReason`` , and ``onExitCode`` ) are met. The values aren't case sensitive.

            

          
        
    
    
    :type propagateTags: boolean
    :param propagateTags: 

      Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job definition to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified, the tags are not propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task creation. For tags with the same name, job tags are given priority over job definitions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the ``FAILED`` state.

      

    
    :type timeout: dict
    :param timeout: 

      The timeout configuration for jobs that are submitted with this job definition, after which AWS Batch terminates your jobs if they have not finished. If a job is terminated due to a timeout, it isn't retried. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds. Any timeout configuration that's specified during a  SubmitJob operation overrides the timeout configuration defined here. For more information, see `Job Timeouts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/job_timeouts.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

      

    
      - **attemptDurationSeconds** *(integer) --* 

        The time duration in seconds (measured from the job attempt's ``startedAt`` timestamp) after which AWS Batch terminates your jobs if they have not finished. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds.

        

      
    
    :type tags: dict
    :param tags: 

      The tags that you apply to the job definition to help you categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more information, see `Tagging AWS Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using-tags.html>`__ in *AWS Batch User Guide* .

  .. py:method:: submit_job(**kwargs)

    

    Submits an AWS Batch job from a job definition. Parameters that are specified during  SubmitJob override parameters defined in the job definition. vCPU and memory requirements that are specified in the ``ResourceRequirements`` objects in the job definition are the exception. They can't be overridden this way using the ``memory`` and ``vcpus`` parameters. Rather, you must specify updates to job definition parameters in a ``ResourceRequirements`` object that's included in the ``containerOverrides`` parameter.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Jobs that run on Fargate resources can't be guaranteed to run for more than 14 days. This is because, after 14 days, Fargate resources might become unavailable and job might be terminated.

      The job queue where the job is submitted. You can specify either the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the queue.

      

    
    :type arrayProperties: dict
    :param arrayProperties: 

      The array properties for the submitted job, such as the size of the array. The array size can be between 2 and 10,000. If you specify array properties for a job, it becomes an array job. For more information, see `Array Jobs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/array_jobs.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

    :param dependsOn: 

      A list of dependencies for the job. A job can depend upon a maximum of 20 jobs. You can specify a ``SEQUENTIAL`` type dependency without specifying a job ID for array jobs so that each child array job completes sequentially, starting at index 0. You can also specify an ``N_TO_N`` type dependency with a job ID for array jobs. In that case, each index child of this job must wait for the corresponding index child of each dependency to complete before it can begin.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        An object representing an AWS Batch job dependency.

    :type parameters: dict
    :param parameters: 

      Additional parameters passed to the job that replace parameter substitution placeholders that are set in the job definition. Parameters are specified as a key and value pair mapping. Parameters in a ``SubmitJob`` request override any corresponding parameter defaults from the job definition.

      

    
      - *(string) --*

      - **vcpus** *(integer) --* 

        This parameter indicates the number of vCPUs reserved for the container.It overrides the ``vcpus`` parameter that's set in the job definition, but doesn't override any vCPU requirement specified in the ``resourceRequirement`` structure in the job definition.

         

        This parameter is supported for jobs that run on EC2 resources, but isn't supported for jobs that run on Fargate resources. For Fargate resources, you can only use ``resourceRequirement`` . For EC2 resources, you can use either this parameter or ``resourceRequirement`` but not both. 

         

        This parameter maps to ``CpuShares`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--cpu-shares`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. You must specify at least one vCPU.

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that run on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided. For jobs that run on Fargate resources, you must specify the vCPU requirement for the job using ``resourceRequirements`` .

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to single-node container jobs or for jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

           

        

      
      - **environment** *(list) --* 

        The environment variables to send to the container. You can add new environment variables, which are added to the container at launch, or you can override the existing environment variables from the Docker image or the job definition.

         

        .. note::

           

          Environment variables must not start with ``AWS_BATCH`` ; this naming convention is reserved for variables that are set by the AWS Batch service.

           

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A key-value pair object.

          

        
          - **name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the key-value pair. For environment variables, this is the name of the environment variable.

            

          
          - **value** *(string) --* 

            The value of the key-value pair. For environment variables, this is the value of the environment variable.

            

          
        
    
      - **resourceRequirements** *(list) --*

        - *(dict) --* 

          The type and amount of a resource to assign to a container. The supported resources include ``GPU`` , ``MEMORY`` , and ``VCPU`` .

          

        
          - **value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The quantity of the specified resource to reserve for the container. The values vary based on the ``type`` specified.

              type="GPU"  

            The number of physical GPUs to reserve for the container. The number of GPUs reserved for all containers in a job shouldn't exceed the number of available GPUs on the compute resource that the job is launched on.

             

            .. note::

               

              GPUs are not available for jobs running on Fargate resources.

               

              type="MEMORY"  

            The memory hard limit (in MiB) present to the container. This parameter is supported for jobs running on EC2 resources. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified, the container is terminated. This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--memory`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job. This is required but can be specified in several places for multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. It must be specified for each node at least once. This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--memory`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

             

            .. note::

               

              If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see `Memory Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

               

             

            For jobs running on Fargate resources, then ``value`` is the hard limit (in MiB), and must match one of the supported values and the ``VCPU`` values must be one of the values supported for that memory value.

    :type retryStrategy: dict
    :param retryStrategy: 

      The retry strategy to use for failed jobs from this  SubmitJob operation. When a retry strategy is specified here, it overrides the retry strategy defined in the job definition.

      

    
      - **attempts** *(integer) --* 

        The number of times to move a job to the ``RUNNABLE`` status. You can specify between 1 and 10 attempts. If the value of ``attempts`` is greater than one, the job is retried on failure the same number of attempts as the value.

        

      
      - **evaluateOnExit** *(list) --* 

        Array of up to 5 objects that specify conditions under which the job should be retried or failed. If this parameter is specified, then the ``attempts`` parameter must also be specified.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Specifies a set of conditions to be met, and an action to take (``RETRY`` or ``EXIT`` ) if all conditions are met.

The pattern can be up to 512 characters long, and can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), colons (:), and white space (including spaces or tabs). It can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.

            

          
          - **onReason** *(string) --* 

            Contains a glob pattern to match against the ``Reason`` returned for a job. The pattern can be up to 512 characters long, and can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), colons (:), and white space (including spaces and tabs). It can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.

            

          
          - **onExitCode** *(string) --* 

            Contains a glob pattern to match against the decimal representation of the ``ExitCode`` returned for a job. The pattern can be up to 512 characters long, can contain only numbers, and can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.

    :type propagateTags: boolean
    :param propagateTags: 

      Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job definition to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task creation. For tags with the same name, job tags are given priority over job definitions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the ``FAILED`` state. When specified, this overrides the tag propagation setting in the job definition.

      

    
    :type timeout: dict
    :param timeout: 

      The timeout configuration for this  SubmitJob operation. You can specify a timeout duration after which AWS Batch terminates your jobs if they haven't finished. If a job is terminated due to a timeout, it isn't retried. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds. This configuration overrides any timeout configuration specified in the job definition. For array jobs, child jobs have the same timeout configuration as the parent job. For more information, see `Job Timeouts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/job_timeouts.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

      

    
      - **attemptDurationSeconds** *(integer) --* 

        The time duration in seconds (measured from the job attempt's ``startedAt`` timestamp) after which AWS Batch terminates your jobs if they have not finished. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds.

        

      
    
    :type tags: dict
    :param tags: 

      The tags that you apply to the job request to help you categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value.

      )
    :type computeEnvironment: string
    :param computeEnvironment: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment to update.

      

    
    :type state: string
    :param state: 

      The state of the compute environment. Compute environments in the ``ENABLED`` state can accept jobs from a queue and scale in or out automatically based on the workload demand of its associated queues.

       

      If the state is ``ENABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.

       

      If the state is ``DISABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a ``STARTING`` or ``RUNNING`` state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the ``DISABLED`` state don't scale out. However, they scale in to ``minvCpus`` value after instances become idle.

      

    
    :type computeResources: dict
    :param computeResources: 

      Details of the compute resources managed by the compute environment. Required for a managed compute environment. For more information, see `Compute Environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

      

    
      - **minvCpus** *(integer) --* 

        The minimum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environment should maintain.

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

           

        

      
      - **maxvCpus** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environment can reach.

         

        .. note::

           

          With both ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE`` and ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` allocation strategies, AWS Batch might need to exceed ``maxvCpus`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds ``maxvCpus`` by more than a single instance. That is, no more than a single instance from among those specified in your compute environment.

           

        

      
      - **desiredvCpus** *(integer) --* 

        The desired number of Amazon EC2 vCPUS in the compute environment.

         

        .. note::

           

          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

           

        

      
      - **subnets** *(list) --* 

        The VPC subnets that the compute resources are launched into. Fargate compute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. Providing an empty list will be handled as if this parameter wasn't specified and no change is made. This can't be specified for EC2 compute resources. For more information, see `VPCs and Subnets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* .

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **securityGroupIds** *(list) --* 

        The Amazon EC2 security groups associated with instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is required for Fargate compute resources, where it can contain up to 5 security groups. This can't be specified for EC2 compute resources. Providing an empty list is handled as if this parameter wasn't specified and no change is made.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    
    :type serviceRole: string
    :param serviceRole: 

      The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows AWS Batch to make calls to other AWS services on your behalf. For more information, see `AWS Batch service IAM role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

       

      .. warning::

         

        If the compute environment has a service-linked role, it cannot be changed to use a regular IAM role. If the compute environment has a regular IAM role, it cannot be changed to use a service-linked role.

         

       

      If your specified role has a path other than ``/`` , then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.

       

      .. note::

         

        Depending on how you created your AWS Batch service role, its ARN might contain the ``service-role`` path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, AWS Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the ``service-role`` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.

      The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.

      

    
    :type state: string
    :param state: 

      Describes the queue's ability to accept new jobs. If the job queue state is ``ENABLED`` , it can accept jobs. If the job queue state is ``DISABLED`` , new jobs can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.

      

    
    :type priority: integer
    :param priority: 

      The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the ``priority`` parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order, for example, a job queue with a priority value of ``10`` is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of ``1`` . All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (``EC2`` or ``SPOT`` ) or Fargate (``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` ). EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

      

    
    :type computeEnvironmentOrder: list
    :param computeEnvironmentOrder: 

      Details the set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order relative to each other. This is one of the parameters used by the job scheduler to determine which compute environment should run a given job. Compute environments must be in the ``VALID`` state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (``EC2`` or ``SPOT`` ) or Fargate (``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` ). EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

       

      .. note::

         

        All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. AWS Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.

         

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The order in which compute environments are tried for job placement within a queue. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried for job placement first. Compute environments must be in the ``VALID`` state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (``EC2`` or ``SPOT`` ) or Fargate (``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

            - **state** *(string) --* 

              The state of the compute environment. The valid values are ``ENABLED`` or ``DISABLED`` .

               

              If the state is ``ENABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment.

                If you choose ``SPOT`` , you must also specify an Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role with the ``spotIamFleetRole`` parameter. For more information, see `Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/spot_fleet_IAM_role.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                
              

              - **allocationStrategy** *(string) --* 

                The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This might be because of availability of the instance type in the Region or `Amazon EC2 service limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>`__ . For more information, see `Allocation Strategies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/allocation-strategies.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                   

                  BEST_FIT (default)  

                AWS Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren't available, AWS Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren't enough instances available, or if the user is hitting `Amazon EC2 service limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>`__ then additional jobs aren't run until the currently running jobs have completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with ``BEST_FIT`` then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified.

                  BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE  

                AWS Batch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren't available, AWS Batch will select new instance types.

                  SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED  

                AWS Batch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.

                   

                With both ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE`` and ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` strategies, AWS Batch might need to go above ``maxvCpus`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds ``maxvCpus`` by more than a single instance.

                
              

              - **minvCpus** *(integer) --* 

                The minimum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environment should maintain (even if the compute environment is ``DISABLED`` ).

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                   

                
              

              - **maxvCpus** *(integer) --* 

                The maximum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that a compute environment can reach.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  With both ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE`` and ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` allocation strategies, AWS Batch might need to exceed ``maxvCpus`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds ``maxvCpus`` by more than a single instance. For example, no more than a single instance from among those specified in your compute environment is allocated.

                   

                
              

              - **desiredvCpus** *(integer) --* 

                The desired number of Amazon EC2 vCPUS in the compute environment. AWS Batch modifies this value between the minimum and maximum values, based on job queue demand.

                 

                .. note::

              - **instanceTypes** *(list) --* 

                The instances types that can be launched. You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, ``c5`` or ``p3`` ), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as ``c5.8xlarge`` ). You can also choose ``optimal`` to select instance types (from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families) that match the demand of your job queues.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                   

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  When you create a compute environment, the instance types that you select for the compute environment must share the same architecture. For example, you can't mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute environment.

                   

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  Currently, ``optimal`` uses instance types from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families. In Regions that don't have instance types from those instance families, instance types from the C5, M5. and R5 instance families are used.

                   

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **imageId** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is overridden by the ``imageIdOverride`` member of the ``Ec2Configuration`` structure.

                 

                .. note::

                .. note::

                   

                  The AMI that you choose for a compute environment must match the architecture of the instance types that you intend to use for that compute environment. For example, if your compute environment uses A1 instance types, the compute resource AMI that you choose must support ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both x86 and ARM versions of the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. For more information, see `Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#ecs-optimized-ami-linux-variants.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                   

                
              

              - **subnets** *(list) --* 

                The VPC subnets into which the compute resources are launched. These subnets must be within the same VPC. Fargate compute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For more information, see `VPCs and Subnets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* .

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **securityGroupIds** *(list) --* 

                The Amazon EC2 security groups associated with instances launched in the compute environment. One or more security groups must be specified, either in ``securityGroupIds`` or using a launch template referenced in ``launchTemplate`` . This parameter is required for jobs running on Fargate resources and must contain at least one security group. Fargate doesn't support launch templates. If security groups are specified using both ``securityGroupIds`` and ``launchTemplate`` , the values in ``securityGroupIds`` is used.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **ec2KeyPair** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon EC2 key pair that's used for instances launched in the compute environment. You can use this key pair to log in to your instances with SSH.

                 

                .. note::

              - **instanceRole** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, `` *ecsInstanceRole* `` or ``arn:aws:iam::*<aws_account_id>* :instance-profile/*ecsInstanceRole* `` . For more information, see `Amazon ECS Instance Role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/instance_IAM_role.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

              - **tags** *(dict) --* 

                Key-value pair tags to be applied to EC2 resources that are launched in the compute environment. For AWS Batch, these take the form of "String1": "String2", where String1 is the tag key and String2 is the tag value−for example, { "Name": "AWS Batch Instance - C4OnDemand" }. This is helpful for recognizing your AWS Batch instances in the Amazon EC2 console. These tags can't be updated or removed after the compute environment has been created; any changes require creating a new compute environment and removing the old compute environment. These tags aren't seen when using the AWS Batch ``ListTagsForResource`` API operation.

                 

                .. note::

              - **placementGroup** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute resources. If you intend to submit multi-node parallel jobs to your compute environment, you should consider creating a cluster placement group and associate it with your compute resources. This keeps your multi-node parallel job on a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone with high network flow potential. For more information, see `Placement Groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* .

              - **bidPercentage** *(integer) --* 

                The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be less than 20% of the current On-Demand price for that Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of the On-Demand price.

                    Contains a glob pattern to match against the ``StatusReason`` returned for a job. The pattern can be up to 512 characters long, and can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), colons (:), and white space (including spaces or tabs). It can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.

                    
                  

                  - **onReason** *(string) --*

                The image used to start a container. This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker Hub registry are available by default. Other repositories are specified with `` *repository-url* /*image* :*tag* `` . Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to ``Image`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``IMAGE`` parameter of `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  Docker image architecture must match the processor architecture of the compute resources that they're scheduled on. For example, ARM-based Docker images can only run on ARM-based compute resources.

                   

                 

                 
                * Images in Amazon ECR repositories use the full registry and repository URI (for example, ``012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>`` ). 
                 
                * Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, ``ubuntu`` or ``mongo`` ). 
                 
                * Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, ``amazon/amazon-ecs-agent`` ). 
                 
                * Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, ``quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu`` ). 
                 

                
              

              - **vcpus** *(integer) --* 

                The number of vCPUs reserved for the job. Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. This parameter maps to ``CpuShares`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--cpu-shares`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . The number of vCPUs must be specified but can be be specified in several places. You must specify it at least once for each node.

                 

                This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported for jobs that run on Fargate resources. For these resources, use ``resourceRequirement`` instead. You can use this parameter or ``resourceRequirements`` structure but not both.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided. For jobs that run on Fargate resources, you must specify the vCPU requirement for the job using ``resourceRequirements`` .

                   

                
              

              - **memory** *(integer) --* 

                This parameter indicates the memory hard limit (in MiB) for a container. If your container attempts to exceed the specified number, it is terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job using this parameter. The memory hard limit can be specified in several places. It must be specified for each node at least once.

                 

                This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--memory`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                 

                This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported on Fargate resources. For Fargate resources, you should specify the memory requirement using ``resourceRequirement`` . You can do this for EC2 resources.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see `Memory Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                   

                
              

              - **command** *(list) --* 

                The command that's passed to the container. This parameter maps to ``Cmd`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``COMMAND`` parameter to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . For more information, see `https\://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd>`__ .

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **jobRoleArn** *(string) --*

For more information, see `IAM Roles for Tasks <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                
              

              - **executionRoleArn** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution role that AWS Batch can assume. For jobs that run on Fargate resources, you must provide an execution role. For more information, see `AWS Batch execution IAM role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/execution-IAM-role.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                
              

              - **volumes** *(list) --* 

                A list of data volumes used in a job.

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A data volume used in a job's container properties.

                  
                  

                  - **host** *(dict) --* 

                    The contents of the ``host`` parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                       

                    
                    

                    - **sourcePath** *(string) --* 

                      The path on the host container instance that's presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If this parameter contains a file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the source path location doesn't exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that run on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                         

                      
                
                  

                  - **name** *(string) --* 

                    The name of the volume. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. This name is referenced in the ``sourceVolume`` parameter of container definition ``mountPoints`` .

                    
                  

                  - **efsVolumeConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                    This parameter is specified when you are using an Amazon Elastic File System file system for job storage. Jobs running on Fargate resources must specify a ``platformVersion`` of at least ``1.4.0`` .

                    
                    

                    - **fileSystemId** *(string) --*

                    .. note::

                       

                      This object isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                       

                    
                    

                    - **hostPath** *(string) --* 

                      The path for the device on the host container instance.

                      
                    

                    - **containerPath** *(string) --* 

                      The path inside the container used to expose the host device. By default, the ``hostPath`` value is used.

                      
                    

                    - **permissions** *(list) --* 

                      The explicit permissions to provide to the container for the device. By default, the container has permissions for ``read`` , ``write`` , and ``mknod`` for the device.

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
              
                

                - **initProcessEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

                  If true, run an ``init`` process inside the container that forwards signals and reaps processes. This parameter maps to the ``--init`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . This parameter requires version 1.25 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

                  
                

                - **sharedMemorySize** *(integer) --* 

                  The value for the size (in MiB) of the ``/dev/shm`` volume. This parameter maps to the ``--shm-size`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                     

                  
                

                - **tmpfs** *(list) --* 

                  The container path, mount options, and size (in MiB) of the tmpfs mount. This parameter maps to the ``--tmpfs`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                     

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    The container path, mount options, and size of the tmpfs mount.

                     

                    .. note::

                    - **containerPath** *(string) --* 

                      The absolute file path in the container where the tmpfs volume is mounted.

                      
                    

                    - **size** *(integer) --* 

                      The size (in MiB) of the tmpfs volume.

                      
                    

                    - **mountOptions** *(list) --* 

                      The list of tmpfs volume mount options.

                       

                      Valid values: "``defaults`` " | "``ro`` " | "``rw`` " | "``suid`` " | "``nosuid`` " | "``dev`` " | "``nodev`` " | "``exec`` " | "``noexec`` " | "``sync`` " | "``async`` " | "``dirsync`` " | "``remount`` " | "``mand`` " | "``nomand`` " | "``atime`` " | "``noatime`` " | "``diratime`` " | "``nodiratime`` " | "``bind`` " | "``rbind" | "unbindable" | "runbindable" | "private" | "rprivate" | "shared" | "rshared" | "slave" | "rslave" | "relatime`` " | "``norelatime`` " | "``strictatime`` " | "``nostrictatime`` " | "``mode`` " | "``uid`` " | "``gid`` " | "``nr_inodes`` " | "``nr_blocks`` " | "``mpol`` "

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
              
                

                - **maxSwap** *(integer) --* 

                  The total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This parameter is translated to the ``--memory-swap`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ where the value is the sum of the container memory plus the ``maxSwap`` value. For more information, see ` ``--memory-swap`` details <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#--memory-swap-details>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                   

                  If a ``maxSwap`` value of ``0`` is specified, the container doesn't use swap. Accepted values are ``0`` or any positive integer. If the ``maxSwap`` parameter is omitted, the container doesn't use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A ``maxSwap`` value must be set for the ``swappiness`` parameter to be used.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                     

                  
                

                - **swappiness** *(integer) --* 

                  This allows you to tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. A ``swappiness`` value of ``0`` causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A ``swappiness`` value of ``100`` causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between ``0`` and ``100`` . If the ``swappiness`` parameter isn't specified, a default value of ``60`` is used. If a value isn't specified for ``maxSwap`` then this parameter is ignored. If ``maxSwap`` is set to 0, the container doesn't use swap. This parameter maps to the ``--memory-swappiness`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                   

                  Consider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.

                   

                   
                  * Swap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for the containers to use. 

                  .. note::

                     The Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don't have swap enabled by default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more information, see `Instance Store Swap Volumes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-store-swap-volumes.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* or `How do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file? <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-memory-swap-file/>`__   

                   
                   
                  * The swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using EC2 resources. 
                   
                  * If the ``maxSwap`` and ``swappiness`` parameters are omitted from a job definition, each container will have a default ``swappiness`` value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited to two times the memory reservation of the container. 
                   

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                     

                  
            
              

              - **logConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                The log configuration specification for the container.

                 

                This parameter maps to ``LogConfig`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--log-driver`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see `Configure logging drivers <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  AWS Batch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the  LogConfiguration data type).

                   

                 

                This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see `Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                   

                
                

                - **logDriver** *(string) --* 

                  The log driver to use for the container. The valid values listed for this parameter are log drivers that the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by default.

                   

                  The supported log drivers are ``awslogs`` , ``fluentd`` , ``gelf`` , ``json-file`` , ``journald`` , ``logentries`` , ``syslog`` , and ``splunk`` .

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Jobs running on Fargate resources are restricted to the ``awslogs`` and ``splunk`` log drivers.

                     

                    awslogs  

                  Specifies the Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver. For more information, see `Using the awslogs Log Driver <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using_awslogs.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* and `Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/awslogs/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    fluentd  

                  Specifies the Fluentd logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Fluentd logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/fluentd/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    gelf  

                  Specifies the Graylog Extended Format (GELF) logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Graylog Extended Format logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/gelf/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    journald  

                  Specifies the journald logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Journald logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/journald/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    json-file  

                  Specifies the JSON file logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `JSON File logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    splunk  

                  Specifies the Splunk logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Splunk logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/splunk/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                    syslog  

                  Specifies the syslog logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see `Syslog logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/syslog/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                     

                  .. note::

                     

                    If you have a custom driver that's not listed earlier that you want to work with the Amazon ECS container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that's `available on GitHub <https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent>`__ and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you want to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn't currently support running modified copies of this software.

                     

                   

                  This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance.

                      The secret to expose to the container. The supported values are either the full ARN of the AWS Secrets Manager secret or the full ARN of the parameter in the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        If the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the job you're launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.

              - **networkConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                The network configuration for jobs running on Fargate resources. Jobs running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.

                
                

                - **assignPublicIp** *(string) --* 

                  Indicates whether the job should have a public IP address. For a job running on Fargate resources in a private subnet to send outbound traffic to the internet (for example, in order to pull container images), the private subnet requires a NAT gateway be attached to route requests to the internet. For more information, see `Amazon ECS task networking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html>`__ . The default value is "DISABLED".

                  
            
              

              - **fargatePlatformConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                The platform configuration for jobs running on Fargate resources. Jobs running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.

                
                

                - **platformVersion** *(string) --* 

                  The AWS Fargate platform version where the jobs are running. A platform version is specified only for jobs running on Fargate resources. If one isn't specified, the ``LATEST`` platform version is used by default. This uses a recent, approved version of the AWS Fargate platform for compute resources. For more information, see `AWS Fargate platform versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                  
            
          
            

            - **timeout** *(dict) --* 

              The timeout configuration for jobs that are submitted with this job definition. You can specify a timeout duration after which AWS Batch terminates your jobs if they haven't finished.

              
              

              - **attemptDurationSeconds** *(integer) --* 

                The time duration in seconds (measured from the job attempt's ``startedAt`` timestamp) after which AWS Batch terminates your jobs if they have not finished. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds.

                
          
            

            - **nodeProperties** *(dict) --* 

              An object with various properties specific to multi-node parallel jobs.

               

              .. note::

                 

                If the job runs on Fargate resources, then you must not specify ``nodeProperties`` ; use ``containerProperties`` instead.

                 

              
              

              - **numNodes** *(integer) --* 

                The number of nodes associated with a multi-node parallel job.

                
              

              - **mainNode** *(integer) --* 

                Specifies the node index for the main node of a multi-node parallel job. This node index value must be fewer than the number of nodes.

                - *(dict) --* 

                  An object representing the properties of the node range for a multi-node parallel job.

                  
                  

                  - **targetNodes** *(string) --* 

                    The range of nodes, using node index values. A range of ``0:3`` indicates nodes with index values of ``0`` through ``3`` . If the starting range value is omitted (``:n`` ), then ``0`` is used to start the range. If the ending range value is omitted (``n:`` ), then the highest possible node index is used to end the range. Your accumulative node ranges must account for all nodes (``0:n`` ). You can nest node ranges, for example ``0:10`` and ``4:5`` , in which case the ``4:5`` range properties override the ``0:10`` properties.

                    
                  

                  - **container** *(dict) --*

                      The image used to start a container. This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker Hub registry are available by default. Other repositories are specified with `` *repository-url* /*image* :*tag* `` . Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to ``Image`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``IMAGE`` parameter of `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        Docker image architecture must match the processor architecture of the compute resources that they're scheduled on. For example, ARM-based Docker images can only run on ARM-based compute resources.

                         

                       

                       
                      * Images in Amazon ECR repositories use the full registry and repository URI (for example, ``012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>`` ). 
                       
                      * Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, ``ubuntu`` or ``mongo`` ). 
                       
                      * Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, ``amazon/amazon-ecs-agent`` ). 
                       
                      * Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, ``quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu`` ). 
                       

                      
                    

                    - **vcpus** *(integer) --* 

                      The number of vCPUs reserved for the job. Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. This parameter maps to ``CpuShares`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--cpu-shares`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . The number of vCPUs must be specified but can be be specified in several places. You must specify it at least once for each node.

                       

                      This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported for jobs that run on Fargate resources. For these resources, use ``resourceRequirement`` instead. You can use this parameter or ``resourceRequirements`` structure but not both.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided. For jobs that run on Fargate resources, you must specify the vCPU requirement for the job using ``resourceRequirements`` .

                         

                      
                    

                    - **memory** *(integer) --* 

                      This parameter indicates the memory hard limit (in MiB) for a container. If your container attempts to exceed the specified number, it is terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job using this parameter. The memory hard limit can be specified in several places. It must be specified for each node at least once.

                       

                      This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--memory`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                       

                      This parameter is supported on EC2 resources but isn't supported on Fargate resources. For Fargate resources, you should specify the memory requirement using ``resourceRequirement`` . You can do this for EC2 resources.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see `Memory Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                         

                      
                    

                    - **command** *(list) --* 

                      The command that's passed to the container. This parameter maps to ``Cmd`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``COMMAND`` parameter to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                    - **volumes** *(list) --* 

                      A list of data volumes used in a job.

                      
                      

                      - *(dict) --* 

                        A data volume used in a job's container properties.

                        
                        

                        - **host** *(dict) --* 

                          The contents of the ``host`` parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.

                           

                          .. note::

                             

                            This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                             

                          
                          

                          - **sourcePath** *(string) --* 

                            The path on the host container instance that's presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If this parameter contains a file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the source path location doesn't exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.

                             

                            .. note::

                          - **rootDirectory** *(string) --* 

                            The directory within the Amazon EFS file system to mount as the root directory inside the host. If this parameter is omitted, the root of the Amazon EFS volume will be used. Specifying ``/`` will have the same effect as omitting this parameter.

                             

                            .. warning::

                               

                              If an EFS access point is specified in the ``authorizationConfig`` , the root directory parameter must either be omitted or set to ``/`` which will enforce the path set on the Amazon EFS access point.

                      - **tmpfs** *(list) --* 

                        The container path, mount options, and size (in MiB) of the tmpfs mount. This parameter maps to the ``--tmpfs`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                         

                        .. note::

                          - **containerPath** *(string) --* 

                            The absolute file path in the container where the tmpfs volume is mounted.

                            
                          

                          - **size** *(integer) --* 

                            The size (in MiB) of the tmpfs volume.

                            - *(string) --* 
                        
                      
                    
                      

                      - **maxSwap** *(integer) --* 

                        The total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This parameter is translated to the ``--memory-swap`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ where the value is the sum of the container memory plus the ``maxSwap`` value. For more information, see ` ``--memory-swap`` details <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#--memory-swap-details>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                         

                        If a ``maxSwap`` value of ``0`` is specified, the container doesn't use swap. Accepted values are ``0`` or any positive integer. If the ``maxSwap`` parameter is omitted, the container doesn't use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A ``maxSwap`` value must be set for the ``swappiness`` parameter to be used.

                         

                        .. note::

                           

                          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                           

                        
                      

                      - **swappiness** *(integer) --* 

                        This allows you to tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. A ``swappiness`` value of ``0`` causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A ``swappiness`` value of ``100`` causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between ``0`` and ``100`` . If the ``swappiness`` parameter isn't specified, a default value of ``60`` is used. If a value isn't specified for ``maxSwap`` then this parameter is ignored. If ``maxSwap`` is set to 0, the container doesn't use swap. This parameter maps to the ``--memory-swappiness`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                         

                        Consider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.

                         

                         
                        * Swap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for the containers to use. 

                        .. note::

                           The Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don't have swap enabled by default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more information, see `Instance Store Swap Volumes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-store-swap-volumes.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* or `How do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file? <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-memory-swap-file/>`__   

                         
                         
                        * The swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using EC2 resources. 
                         
                        * If the ``maxSwap`` and ``swappiness`` parameters are omitted from a job definition, each container will have a default ``swappiness`` value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited to two times the memory reservation of the container. 
                         

                         

                        .. note::

                           

                          This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                           

                        
                  
                    

                    - **logConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                      The log configuration specification for the container.

                       

                      This parameter maps to ``LogConfig`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`__ and the ``--log-driver`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see `Configure logging drivers <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/>`__ in the Docker documentation.

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        AWS Batch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the  LogConfiguration data type).

                         

                       

                      This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``  

                       

                      .. note::

                         

                        The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see `Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                         

                      
                      

                      - **logDriver** *(string) --* 

                        The log driver to use for the container. The valid values listed for this parameter are log drivers that the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by default.

                         

                        The supported log drivers are ``awslogs`` , ``fluentd`` , ``gelf`` , ``json-file`` , ``journald`` , ``logentries`` , ``syslog`` , and ``splunk`` .

                         

                        .. note::

                           

                          Jobs running on Fargate resources are restricted to the ``awslogs`` and ``splunk`` log drivers.

                           

                          awslogs

                        .. note::

                           

                          If you have a custom driver that's not listed earlier that you want to work with the Amazon ECS container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that's `available on GitHub <https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent>`__ and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you want to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn't currently support running modified copies of this software.

                           

                         

                        This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"``

                          .. note::

                             

                            If the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the job you're launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.

                             

                          
                    
                  
                    

                    - **networkConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                      The network configuration for jobs running on Fargate resources. Jobs running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.

                      
                      

                      - **assignPublicIp** *(string) --* 

                        Indicates whether the job should have a public IP address. For a job running on Fargate resources in a private subnet to send outbound traffic to the internet (for example, in order to pull container images), the private subnet requires a NAT gateway be attached to route requests to the internet. For more information, see `Amazon ECS task networking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html>`__ . The default value is "DISABLED".

                      The platform configuration for jobs running on Fargate resources. Jobs running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.

                      
                      

                      - **platformVersion** *(string) --* 

                        The AWS Fargate platform version where the jobs are running. A platform version is specified only for jobs running on Fargate resources. If one isn't specified, the ``LATEST`` platform version is used by default. This uses a recent, approved version of the AWS Fargate platform for compute resources. For more information, see `AWS Fargate platform versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                        
                  
                
              
            
          
            

            - **tags** *(dict) --* 

              The tags applied to the job definition.

            - **propagateTags** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job definition to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task creation. For tags with the same name, job tags are given priority over job definitions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the ``FAILED`` state.

              
            

            - **platformCapabilities** *(list) --* 

              The platform capabilities required by the job definition. If no value is specified, it defaults to ``EC2`` . Jobs run on Fargate resources specify ``FARGATE`` .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **jobQueues** *(list) --* 

          The list of job queues.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            An object representing the details of an AWS Batch job queue.

            
            

            - **jobQueueName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the job queue.

              
            

            - **jobQueueArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.

              
            

            - **state** *(string) --* 

              Describes the ability of the queue to accept new jobs. If the job queue state is ``ENABLED`` , it's able to accept jobs. If the job queue state is ``DISABLED`` , new jobs can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.

              
            

            - **status** *(string) --* 

              The status of the job queue (for example, ``CREATING`` or ``VALID`` ).

              
            

            - **statusReason** *(string) --* 

              A short, human-readable string to provide additional details about the current status of the job queue.

              
            

            - **priority** *(integer) --* 

              The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the ``priority`` parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order, for example, a job queue with a priority value of ``10`` is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of ``1`` . All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (``EC2`` or ``SPOT`` ) or Fargate (``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

              
            

            - **computeEnvironmentOrder** *(list) --* 

              The compute environments that are attached to the job queue and the order that job placement is preferred. Compute environments are selected for job placement in ascending order.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                The order in which compute environments are tried for job placement within a queue. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried for job placement first. Compute environments must be in the ``VALID`` state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (``EC2`` or ``SPOT`` ) or Fargate (``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. AWS Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.

                   

                
                

                - **order** *(integer) --* 

                  The order of the compute environment. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower ``order`` integer value is tried for job placement first.

                  
                

                - **computeEnvironment** *(string) --* 

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.

                  
            
          
            

            - **tags** *(dict) --* 

              The tags applied to the job queue. For more information, see `Tagging your AWS Batch resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using-tags.html>`__ in *AWS Batch User Guide* .
