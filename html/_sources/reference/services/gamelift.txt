  .. py:method:: accept_match(**kwargs)

    

    Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit. 

     

    When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status ``REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`` . This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.

     

    To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status ``PLACING`` , where a new game session is created for the match. 

     

    If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to ``SEARCHING`` to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to ``CANCELLED`` , and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed.

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: claim_game_server(**kwargs)

    

     **This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.**  

     

    Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players. This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in ``CLAIMED`` status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server. 

     

    To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information. 

     

    When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains ``AVAILABLE`` while the claim status is set to ``CLAIMED`` for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to ``UTILIZED`` (using  UpdateGameServer ) once players join. If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable.

     

    If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following cases:

     

     
    * If the game server utilization status is ``UTILIZED`` . 
     
    * If the game server claim status is ``CLAIMED`` . 
     

     

    .. note::

       

      When claiming a specific game server, this request will succeed even if the game server is running on an instance in ``DRAINING`` status. To avoid this, first check the instance status by calling  DescribeGameServerInstances .

          - **ClaimStatus** *(string) --* 

            Indicates when an available game server has been reserved for gameplay but has not yet started hosting a game. Once it is claimed, the game server remains in ``CLAIMED`` status for a maximum of one minute. During this time, game clients connect to the game server to start the game and trigger the game server to update its utilization status. After one minute, the game server claim status reverts to null.

            
          

          - **UtilizationStatus** *(string) --* 

            Indicates whether the game server is currently available for new games or is busy. Possible statuses include:

             

             
            * ``AVAILABLE`` - The game server is available to be claimed. A game server that has been claimed remains in this status until it reports game hosting activity.  
             
            * ``UTILIZED`` - The game server is currently hosting a game session with players.

            Timestamp that indicates when the game server was created with a  RegisterGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ).

            
          

          - **LastClaimTime** *(datetime) --* 

            Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was claimed with a  ClaimGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ). This value is used to calculate when a claimed game server's status should revert to null.

            
          

          - **LastHealthCheckTime** *(datetime) --* 

            Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was updated with health status using an  UpdateGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ). After game server registration, this property is only changed when a game server update specifies a health check value.

  .. py:method:: create_alias(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build. 

     

    Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. 

     

    To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling ``UpdateAlias`` .

  .. py:method:: create_build(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary files. Game server binaries must be combined into a zip file for use with Amazon GameLift. 

     

    .. warning::

       

      When setting up a new game build for GameLift, we recommend using the AWS CLI command ** `upload-build <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html>`__ ** . This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build files from a file directory to a GameLift Amazon S3 location, and (2) it creates a new build resource. 

       

     

    The ``CreateBuild`` operation can used in the following scenarios:

     

     
    * To create a new game build with build files that are in an Amazon S3 location under an AWS account that you control. To use this option, you must first give Amazon GameLift access to the Amazon S3 bucket. With permissions in place, call ``CreateBuild`` and specify a build name, operating system, and the Amazon S3 storage location of your game build. 
     
    * To directly upload your build files to a GameLift Amazon S3 location. To use this option, first call ``CreateBuild`` and specify a build name and operating system. This operation creates a new build resource and also returns an Amazon S3 location with temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build files to the specified Amazon S3 location. For more information, see `Uploading Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide* . Build files can be uploaded to the GameLift Amazon S3 location once only; that can't be updated.  
     

     

    If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique build ID and places it in ``INITIALIZED`` status. A build must be in ``READY`` status before you can create fleets with it.

      Version information that is associated with a build or script. Version strings do not need to be unique. You can use  UpdateBuild to change this value later. 

      

    
    :type StorageLocation: dict
    :param StorageLocation: 

      Information indicating where your game build files are stored. Use this parameter only when creating a build with files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket that you own. The storage location must specify an Amazon S3 bucket name and key. The location must also specify a role ARN that you set up to allow Amazon GameLift to access your Amazon S3 bucket. The S3 bucket and your new build must be in the same Region.

      

    
      - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

        An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. This is the name of the S3 bucket.

         

        .. note::

           

          GameLift currently does not support uploading from Amazon S3 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

           

        

      
      - **Key** *(string) --* 

        The name of the zip file that contains the build files or script files. 

        

      
      - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Resource Name (`ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

        

      
      - **ObjectVersion** *(string) --* 

        The version of the file, if object versioning is turned on for the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this information when retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parameter to specify a specific version of the file. If not set, the latest version of the file is retrieved. 

        

      
    
    :type OperatingSystem: string
    :param OperatingSystem: 

      The operating system that the game server binaries are built to run on. This value determines the type of fleet resources that you can use for this build. If your game build contains multiple executables, they all must run on the same operating system. If an operating system is not specified when creating a build, Amazon GameLift uses the default value (WINDOWS_2012). This value cannot be changed later.

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      A list of labels to assign to the new build resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation.

  .. py:method:: create_fleet(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to host your custom game server or Realtime Servers. Use this operation to configure the computing resources for your fleet and provide instructions for running game servers on each instance.

     

    Most GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations, including the home Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional set of remote locations. Fleets that are created in the following AWS Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1 (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1 (Ireland), ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets that are created in other GameLift Regions can deploy instances in the fleet's home Region only. All fleet instances use the same configuration regardless of location; however, you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each location.

     

    To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a game server build or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime configuration to direct GameLift how to start and run game servers on each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for inbound traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When creating a multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations.

     

    If successful, this operation creates a new Fleet resource and places it in ``NEW`` status, which prompts GameLift to initiate the `fleet creation workflow <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creation-workflow.html>`__ . You can track fleet creation by checking fleet status using  DescribeFleetAttributes and  DescribeFleetLocationAttributes /, or by monitoring fleet creation events using  DescribeFleetEvents . As soon as the fleet status changes to ``ACTIVE`` , you can enable automatic scaling for the fleet with  PutScalingPolicy and set capacity for the home Region with  UpdateFleetCapacity . When the status of each remote location reaches ``ACTIVE`` , you can set capacity by location using  UpdateFleetCapacity .

  .. py:method:: create_fleet_locations(**kwargs)

    

    Adds remote locations to a fleet and begins populating the new locations with EC2 instances. The new instances conform to the fleet's instance type, auto-scaling, and other configuration settings. 

     

    .. note::

       

      This operation cannot be used with fleets that don't support remote locations. Fleets can have multiple locations only if they reside in AWS Regions that support this feature (see  CreateFleet for the complete list) and were created after the feature was released in March 2021.

       

     

    To add fleet locations, specify the fleet to be updated and provide a list of one or more locations. 

     

    If successful, this operation returns the list of added locations with their status set to ``NEW`` . GameLift initiates the process of starting an instance in each added location. You can track the status of each new location by monitoring location creation events using  DescribeFleetEvents . Alternatively, you can poll location status by calling  DescribeFleetLocationAttributes . After a location status becomes ``ACTIVE`` , you can adjust the location's capacity as needed with  UpdateFleetCapacity .

  .. py:method:: create_game_server_group(**kwargs)

    

     **This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.**  

     

    Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon EC2 instances for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account, and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of your game server groups in the GameLift console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.

     

    Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following: 

     

     
    * An Amazon EC2 launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon EC2 instances with your game server build. For more information, see `Launching an Instance from a Launch Template <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* .  
     
    * An IAM role that extends limited access to your AWS account to allow GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see `Create IAM roles for cross-service interaction <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html>`__ in the *GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide* . 
     

     

    To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon EC2 launch template, and provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift FleetIQ metric.

     

    Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.

    :type GameServerGroupName: string
    :param GameServerGroupName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      An identifier for the new game server group. This value is used to generate unique ARN identifiers for the EC2 Auto Scaling group and the GameLift FleetIQ game server group. The name must be unique per Region per AWS account.

      

    
    :type RoleArn: string
    :param RoleArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (`ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

      

    
    :type MinSize: integer
    :param MinSize: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The minimum number of instances allowed in the EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale down the group below this minimum. In production, this value should be set to at least 1. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.

      

    
    :type MaxSize: integer
    :param MaxSize: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The maximum number of instances allowed in the EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale up the group above this maximum. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.

      

    
    :type LaunchTemplate: dict
    :param LaunchTemplate: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The EC2 launch template that contains configuration settings and game server code to be deployed to all instances in the game server group. You can specify the template using either the template name or ID. For help with creating a launch template, see `Creating a Launch Template for an Auto Scaling Group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.

       

      .. note::

         

        If you specify network interfaces in your launch template, you must explicitly set the property ``AssociatePublicIpAddress`` to "true". If no network interface is specified in the launch template, GameLift FleetIQ uses your account's default VPC.

         

      

    
      - **LaunchTemplateId** *(string) --* 

        A unique identifier for an existing EC2 launch template.

        

      
      - **LaunchTemplateName** *(string) --* 

        A readable identifier for an existing EC2 launch template. 

        

      
      - **Version** *(string) --* 

        The version of the EC2 launch template to use. If no version is specified, the default version will be used. With Amazon EC2, you can specify a default version for a launch template. If none is set, the default is the first version created.

        

      
    
    :type InstanceDefinitions: list
    :param InstanceDefinitions: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The EC2 instance types and sizes to use in the Auto Scaling group. The instance definitions must specify at least two different instance types that are supported by GameLift FleetIQ. For more information on instance types, see `EC2 Instance Types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* . You can optionally specify capacity weighting for each instance type. If no weight value is specified for an instance type, it is set to the default value "1". For more information about capacity weighting, see `Instance Weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html>`__ in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

         **This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game server groups.**  

         

        An allowed instance type for a  GameServerGroup . All game server groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of viable instance types.

        

      
        - **InstanceType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An EC2 instance type designation.

          

        
        - **WeightedCapacity** *(string) --* 

          Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effective options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see `Instance Weighting <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default value is "1".

          

        
      
  
    :type AutoScalingPolicy: dict
    :param AutoScalingPolicy: 

      Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group that is optimized for game hosting. The scaling policy uses the metric ``"PercentUtilizedGameServers"`` to maintain a buffer of idle game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and players. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.

      

    
      - **EstimatedInstanceWarmup** *(integer) --* 

        Length of time, in seconds, it takes for a new instance to start new game server processes and register with GameLift FleetIQ. Specifying a warm-up time can be useful, particularly with game servers that take a long time to start up, because it avoids prematurely starting new instances. 

        

      
      - **TargetTrackingConfiguration** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Settings for a target-based scaling policy applied to Auto Scaling group. These settings are used to create a target-based policy that tracks the GameLift FleetIQ metric ``"PercentUtilizedGameServers"`` and specifies a target value for the metric. As player usage changes, the policy triggers to adjust the game server group capacity so that the metric returns to the target value. 

        

      
        - **TargetValue** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Desired value to use with a game server group target-based scaling policy. 

          

        
      
    
    :type BalancingStrategy: string
    :param BalancingStrategy: 

      Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:

       

       
      * ``SPOT_ONLY`` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced. 
       
      * ``SPOT_PREFERRED`` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances. 
       
      * ``ON_DEMAND_ONLY`` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force. 
       

      

    
    :type GameServerProtectionPolicy: string
    :param GameServerProtectionPolicy: 

      A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. This property is set to ``NO_PROTECTION`` by default.

      

    
    :type VpcSubnets: list
    :param VpcSubnets: 

      A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets to use with instances in the game server group. By default, all GameLift FleetIQ-supported Availability Zones are used. You can use this parameter to specify VPCs that you've set up. This property cannot be updated after the game server group is created, and the corresponding Auto Scaling group will always use the property value that is set with this request, even if the Auto Scaling group is updated directly.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      A list of labels to assign to the new game server group resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources is useful for resource management, access management, and cost allocation. For more information, see `Tagging AWS Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *AWS General Reference* . Once the resource is created, you can use  TagResource ,  UntagResource , and  ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags, respectively. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A label that can be assigned to a GameLift resource.

  .. py:method:: create_game_session(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a multiplayer game session for players in a specific fleet location. This operation prompts an available server process to start a game session and retrieves connection information for the new game session. As an alternative, consider using the GameLift game session placement feature with 

     

    with  StartGameSessionPlacement , which uses FleetIQ algorithms and queues to optimize the placement process.

     

    When creating a game session, you specify exactly where you want to place it and provide a set of game session configuration settings. The fleet must be in ``ACTIVE`` status before a game session can be created in it. 

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To create a game session on an instance in a fleet's home Region, provide a fleet or alias ID along with your game session configuration.  
     
    * To create a game session on an instance in a fleet's remote location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, along with your game session configuration.  
     

     

    If successful, a workflow is initiated to start a new game session. A ``GameSession`` object is returned containing the game session configuration and status. When the status is ``ACTIVE`` , game session connection information is provided and player sessions can be created for the game session. By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using  UpdateGameSession to change the game session's player session creation policy.

     

    Game session logs are retained for all active game sessions for 14 days. To access the logs, call  GetGameSessionLogUrl to download the log files.

     

     *Available in GameLift Local.*

    :param MaximumPlayerSessionCount: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The maximum number of players that can be connected simultaneously to the game session.

      

    
    :type Name: string
    :param Name: 

      A descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Session names do not need to be unique.

      

    
    :type GameProperties: list
    :param GameProperties: 

      A set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a game session. When included in a game session request, these properties communicate details to be used when setting up the new game session. For example, a game property might specify a game mode, level, or map. Game properties are passed to the game server process when initiating a new game session. For more information, see the `GameLift Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#gamelift-sdk-client-api-create>`__ .

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The game property identifier.

          The game property value.

          

        
      
  
    :type CreatorId: string
    :param CreatorId: 

      A unique identifier for a player or entity creating the game session. This parameter is required when requesting a new game session on a fleet with a resource creation limit policy. This type of policy limits the number of concurrent active game sessions that one player can create within a certain time span. GameLift uses the CreatorId to evaluate the new request against the policy.

    :param GameSessionId: 

       *This parameter is no longer preferred. Please use ``IdempotencyToken`` instead.* Custom string that uniquely identifies a request for a new game session. Maximum token length is 48 characters. If provided, this string is included in the new game session's ID.

      

    
    :type IdempotencyToken: string
    :param IdempotencyToken: 

      Custom string that uniquely identifies the new game session request. This is useful for ensuring that game session requests with the same idempotency token are processed only once. Subsequent requests with the same string return the original ``GameSession`` object, with an updated status. Maximum token length is 48 characters. If provided, this string is included in the new game session's ID. A game session ARN has the following format: ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesession/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or idempotency token>`` . Idempotency tokens remain in use for 30 days after a game session has ended; game session objects are retained for this time period and then deleted.

  .. py:method:: create_game_session_queue(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a placement queue that processes requests for new game sessions. A queue uses FleetIQ algorithms to determine the best placement locations and find an available game server there, then prompts the game server process to start a new game session. 

     

    A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (GameLift fleets or aliases), which determine the locations where the queue can place new game sessions. These destinations can span multiple fleet types (Spot and On-Demand), instance types, and AWS Regions. If the queue includes multi-location fleets, the queue is able to place game sessions in all of a fleet's remote locations. You can opt to filter out individual locations if needed.

     

    The queue configuration also determines how FleetIQ selects the best available placement for a new game session. Before searching for an available game server, FleetIQ first prioritizes the queue's destinations and locations, with the best placement locations on top. You can set up the queue to use the FleetIQ default prioritization or provide an alternate set of priorities.

     

    To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, and a list of destinations. Optionally, specify a sort configuration and/or a filter, and define a set of latency cap policies. You can also include the ARN for an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to receive notifications of game session placement activity. Notifications using SNS or CloudWatch events is the preferred way to track placement activity.

     

    If successful, a new ``GameSessionQueue`` object is returned with an assigned queue ARN. New game session requests, which are submitted to the queue with  StartGameSessionPlacement or  StartMatchmaking , reference a queue's name or ARN.

    :type PlayerLatencyPolicies: list
    :param PlayerLatencyPolicies: 

      A set of policies that act as a sliding cap on player latency. FleetIQ works to deliver low latency for most players in a game session.

Multiple policies are applied based on their maximum allowed latency, starting with the lowest value.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Sets a latency cap for individual players when placing a game session. With a latency policy in force, a game session cannot be placed in a fleet location where a player reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are used only with placement request that provide player latency information. Player latency policies can be stacked to gradually relax latency requirements over time. 

         

        Latency policies are part of a  GameSessionQueue .

        

      
        - **MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds** *(integer) --*

        - **PolicyDurationSeconds** *(integer) --* 

          The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. A null value for this property means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.

          

        
      
  
    :type Destinations: list
    :param Destinations: 

      A list of fleets and/or fleet aliases that can be used to fulfill game session placement requests in the queue. Destinations are identified by either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias ARN, and are listed in order of placement preference.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A fleet or alias designated in a game session queue. Queues fulfill requests for new game sessions by placing a new game session on any of the queue's destinations.

  .. py:method:: create_matchmaking_configuration(**kwargs)

    

    Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. Whether your are using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking service, the matchmaking configuration sets out rules for matching players and forming teams. If you're also using GameLift hosting, it defines how to start game sessions for each match. Your matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to handle different game scenarios. All matchmaking requests ( StartMatchmaking or  StartMatchBackfill ) identify the matchmaking configuration to use and provide player attributes consistent with that configuration. 

     

    To create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following: configuration name and FlexMatch mode (with or without GameLift hosting); a rule set that specifies how to evaluate players and find acceptable matches; whether player acceptance is required; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting, you also need to identify the game session queue to use when starting a game session for the match.

     

    In addition, you must set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to receive matchmaking notifications. Provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration. An alternative method, continuously polling ticket status with  DescribeMatchmaking , is only suitable for games in development with low matchmaking usage.

  .. py:method:: create_matchmaking_rule_set(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new rule set for FlexMatch matchmaking. A rule set describes the type of match to create, such as the number and size of teams. It also sets the parameters for acceptable player matches, such as minimum skill level or character type. A rule set is used by a  MatchmakingConfiguration . 

     

    To create a matchmaking rule set, provide unique rule set name and the rule set body in JSON format. Rule sets must be defined in the same Region as the matchmaking configuration they are used with.

     

    Since matchmaking rule sets cannot be edited, it is a good idea to check the rule set syntax using  ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet before creating a new rule set.

    Reserves an open player slot in a game session for a player. New player sessions can be created in any game session with an open slot that is in ``ACTIVE`` status and has a player creation policy of ``ACCEPT_ALL`` . You can add a group of players to a game session with  CreatePlayerSessions . 

     

    To create a player session, specify a game session ID, player ID, and optionally a set of player data. 

     

    If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for the player and a new  PlayerSession object is returned with a player session ID. The player references the player session ID when sending a connection request to the game session, and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the GameLift service. Player sessions cannot be updated.

  .. py:method:: create_player_sessions(**kwargs)

    

    Reserves open slots in a game session for a group of players. New player sessions can be created in any game session with an open slot that is in ``ACTIVE`` status and has a player creation policy of ``ACCEPT_ALL`` . To add a single player to a game session, use  CreatePlayerSession . 

     

    To create player sessions, specify a game session ID and a list of player IDs. Optionally, provide a set of player data for each player ID. 

     

    If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for each player, and new  PlayerSession objects are returned with player session IDs. Each player references their player session ID when sending a connection request to the game session, and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the GameLift service. Player sessions cannot be updated.

     

     *Available in Amazon GameLift Local.*

  .. py:method:: create_script(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new script record for your Realtime Servers script. Realtime scripts are JavaScript that provide configuration settings and optional custom game logic for your game. The script is deployed when you create a Realtime Servers fleet to host your game sessions. Script logic is executed during an active game session. 

     

    To create a new script record, specify a script name and provide the script file(s). The script files and all dependencies must be zipped into a single file. You can pull the zip file from either of these locations: 

     

     
    * A locally available directory. Use the *ZipFile* parameter for this option. 
     
    * An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your AWS account. Use the *StorageLocation* parameter for this option. You'll need to have an Identity Access Management (IAM) role that allows the Amazon GameLift service to access your S3 bucket.  
     

     

    If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a unique script ID. If the script file is provided as a local file, the file is uploaded to an Amazon GameLift-owned S3 bucket and the script record's storage location reflects this location. If the script file is provided as an S3 bucket, Amazon GameLift accesses the file at this storage location as needed for deployment.

      A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a zip file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size of a zip file is 5 MB.

       

      When using the AWS CLI tool to create a script, this parameter is set to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the string "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a binary object. For example: ``--zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip`` .

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      A list of labels to assign to the new script resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see `Tagging AWS Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *AWS General Reference* . Once the resource is created, you can use  TagResource ,  UntagResource , and  ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.

      

    
      - *(dict) --*

  .. py:method:: create_vpc_peering_authorization(**kwargs)

    

    Requests authorization to create or delete a peer connection between the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet and a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your AWS account. VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other AWS resources. Once you've received authorization, call  CreateVpcPeeringConnection to establish the peering connection. For more information, see `VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html>`__ .

     

    You can peer with VPCs that are owned by any AWS account you have access to, including the account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different Regions.

     

    To request authorization to create a connection, call this operation from the AWS account with the VPC that you want to peer to your Amazon GameLift fleet. For example, to enable your game servers to retrieve data from a DynamoDB table, use the account that manages that DynamoDB resource. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the VPC that you want to peer with, and (2) the ID of the AWS account that you use to manage Amazon GameLift. If successful, VPC peering is authorized for the specified VPC. 

     

    To request authorization to delete a connection, call this operation from the AWS account with the VPC that is peered with your Amazon GameLift fleet. Identify the following values: (1) VPC ID that you want to delete the peering connection for, and (2) ID of the AWS account that you use to manage Amazon GameLift. 

     

    The authorization remains valid for 24 hours unless it is canceled by a call to  DeleteVpcPeeringAuthorization . You must create or delete the peering connection while the authorization is valid.

  .. py:method:: create_vpc_peering_connection(**kwargs)

    

    Establishes a VPC peering connection between a virtual private cloud (VPC) in an AWS account with the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet. VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other AWS resources. You can peer with VPCs in any AWS account that you have access to, including the account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different Regions. For more information, see `VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html>`__ .

     

    Before calling this operation to establish the peering connection, you first need to call  CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization and identify the VPC you want to peer with. Once the authorization for the specified VPC is issued, you have 24 hours to establish the connection. These two operations handle all tasks necessary to peer the two VPCs, including acceptance, updating routing tables, etc. 

     

    To establish the connection, call this operation from the AWS account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the fleet you want to be enable a VPC peering connection for; (2) The AWS account with the VPC that you want to peer with; and (3) The ID of the VPC you want to peer with. This operation is asynchronous. If successful, a  VpcPeeringConnection request is created. You can use continuous polling to track the request's status using  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections , or by monitoring fleet events for success or failure using  DescribeFleetEvents .

  .. py:method:: delete_fleet(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes all resources and information related a fleet. Any current fleet instances, including those in remote locations, are shut down. You don't need to call ``DeleteFleetLocations`` separately.

     

    .. note::

       

      If the fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first need to get a valid authorization (good for 24 hours) by calling  CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization . You do not need to explicitly delete the VPC peering connection--this is done as part of the delete fleet process.

       

     

    To delete a fleet, specify the fleet ID to be terminated. During the deletion process the fleet status is changed to ``DELETING`` . When completed, the status switches to ``TERMINATED`` and the fleet event ``FLEET_DELETED`` is sent.

  .. py:method:: delete_game_server_group(**kwargs)

    

     **This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.**  

     

    Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game server group record. You have several options for how these resources are impacted when deleting the game server group. Depending on the type of delete operation selected, this operation might affect these resources:

     

     
    * The game server group 
     
    * The corresponding Auto Scaling group 
     
    * All game servers that are currently running in the group 
     

     

    To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to delete and specify the type of delete operation to initiate. Game server groups can only be deleted if they are in ``ACTIVE`` or ``ERROR`` status.

     

    If the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked off. The game server group status is changed to ``DELETE_SCHEDULED`` , which prevents new game servers from being registered and stops automatic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server group are deregistered, GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources. If any of the delete operations fail, the game server group is placed in ``ERROR`` status.

     

    GameLift FleetIQ emits delete events to Amazon CloudWatch.

          An object that describes the deleted game server group resource, with status updated to ``DELETE_SCHEDULED`` . 

          
          

          - **GameServerGroupName** *(string) --* 

            A developer-defined identifier for the game server group. The name is unique for each Region in each AWS account.

            
          

          - **GameServerGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            A generated unique ID for the game server group.

            
          

          - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (`ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

            
          

          - **InstanceDefinitions** *(list) --* 

            The set of EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ can use when balancing and automatically scaling instances in the corresponding Auto Scaling group. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

               **This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game server groups.**  

               

              An allowed instance type for a  GameServerGroup . All game server groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of viable instance types.

              
              

              - **InstanceType** *(string) --* 

                An EC2 instance type designation.

                
              

              - **WeightedCapacity** *(string) --* 

                Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effective options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see `Instance Weighting <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default value is "1".

                
          
        
          

          - **BalancingStrategy** *(string) --* 

            Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:

             

             
            * ``SPOT_ONLY`` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced. 
             
            * ``SPOT_PREFERRED`` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances. 
             
            * ``ON_DEMAND_ONLY`` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force. 
             

            
          

          - **GameServerProtectionPolicy** *(string) --* 

            A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. 

            
          

          - **AutoScalingGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            A generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is associated with this game server group.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the game server group. Possible statuses include:

             

             
            * ``NEW`` - GameLift FleetIQ has validated the ``CreateGameServerGroup()`` request.  
             
            * ``ACTIVATING`` - GameLift FleetIQ is setting up a game server group, which includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account.  
             
            * ``ACTIVE`` - The game server group has been successfully created.  
             
            * ``DELETE_SCHEDULED`` - A request to delete the game server group has been received.  
             
            * ``DELETING`` - GameLift FleetIQ has received a valid ``DeleteGameServerGroup()`` request and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ must first complete and release hosts before it deletes the Auto Scaling group and the game server group.  
             
            * ``DELETED`` - The game server group has been successfully deleted.  
             
            * ``ERROR`` - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a game server group has failed, resulting in an error state. 
             

            
          

          - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

            Additional information about the current game server group status. This information might provide additional insight on groups that are in ``ERROR`` status.

            
          

          - **SuspendedActions** *(list) --* 

            A list of activities that are currently suspended for this game server group. If this property is empty, all activities are occurring.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ).

            
          

          - **LastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A timestamp that indicates when this game server group was last updated.

You can request a limit increase for your account by using the **Service limits** page in the GameLift console.

     

    Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a fleet's home Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, limits also differ based on the combination of home Region and remote location. All requests must specify an AWS Region (either explicitly or as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote location, you must also specify the location. For example, the following requests all return different results: 

     

     
    * Request specifies the Region ``ap-northeast-1`` with no location. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in ``us-east-2`` , by all of the fleets that reside in ``ap-northeast-1`` .  
     
    * Request specifies the Region ``us-east-1`` with location ``ca-central-1`` . The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in ``ca-central-1`` , by all of the fleets that reside in ``us-east-2`` . These limits do not affect fleets in any other Regions that deploy instances to ``ca-central-1`` . 
     
    * Request specifies the Region ``eu-west-1`` with location ``ca-central-1`` . The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in ``ca-central-1`` , by all of the fleets that reside in ``eu-west-1`` . 
     

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways:

     

     
    * To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed in an AWS Region by fleets that reside in the same Region: Specify the Region only. Optionally, specify a single instance type to retrieve information for. 
     
    * To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed to a remote location by fleets that reside in different AWS Region: Provide both the AWS Region and the remote location. Optionally, specify a single instance type to retrieve information for. 
     

     

    If successful, an ``EC2InstanceLimits`` object is returned with limits and usage data for each requested instance type.

  .. py:method:: describe_fleet_attributes(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves core fleet-wide properties, including the computing hardware and deployment configuration for all instances in the fleet.

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To get attributes for one or more specific fleets, provide a list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.  
     
    * To get attributes for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.  
     

     

    When requesting attributes for multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. 

     

    If successful, a ``FleetAttributes`` object is returned for each fleet requested, unless the fleet identifier is not found. 

     

    .. note::

       

      Some API operations limit the number of fleet IDs that allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the error message contains the maximum allowed number.

  .. py:method:: describe_fleet_capacity(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves the resource capacity settings for one or more fleets. The data returned includes the current fleet capacity (number of EC2 instances), and settings that can control how capacity scaling. For fleets with remote locations, this operation retrieves data for the fleet's home Region only. See  DescribeFleetLocationCapacity to get capacity settings for a fleet's remote locations.

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To get capacity data for one or more specific fleets, provide a list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.  
     
    * To get capacity data for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.  
     

     

    When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. 

     

    If successful, a  FleetCapacity object is returned for each requested fleet ID. Each FleetCapacity object includes a ``Location`` property, which is set to the fleet's home Region. When a list of fleet IDs is provided, attribute objects are returned only for fleets that currently exist.

     

    .. note::

       

      Some API operations may limit the number of fleet IDs that are allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the error message includes the maximum allowed.

            - **EventCode** *(string) --* 

              The type of event being logged. 

               

               **Fleet creation events (ordered by fleet creation activity):**  

               

               
              * FLEET_CREATED -- A fleet resource was successfully created with a status of ``NEW`` . Event messaging includes the fleet ID. 
               
              * FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING -- Fleet status changed from ``NEW`` to ``DOWNLOADING`` . The compressed build has started downloading to a fleet instance for installation. 
               
              * FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build failed to download to the fleet instance. 
               
              * FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files are now being extracted from the uploaded build and saved to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* . 
               
              * FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER – The game server build files were successfully extracted, and the GameLift is now running the build's install script (if one is included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs for this stage list the installation steps and whether or not the install completed successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .  
               
              * FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG -- The build process was successful, and the GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths, which are specified in the fleet's runtime configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths in the runtime configuration and indicate whether each is found. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .  
               
              * FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from ``DOWNLOADING`` to ``VALIDATING`` . 
               
              * FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the runtime configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not exist on the instance. 
               
              * FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from ``VALIDATING`` to ``BUILDING`` . 
               
              * FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE -- Validation of the runtime configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to run on the fleet instance. 
               
              * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from ``BUILDING`` to ``ACTIVATING`` .  
               
              * FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED - The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the steps in the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the game build was successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not able to start a server process.

              * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status changed from ``ACTIVATING`` to ``ACTIVE`` . The fleet is now ready to host game sessions. 
               

               

               **VPC peering events:**  

               

               
              * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has been established between the VPC for an GameLift fleet and a VPC in your AWS account. 
               
              * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connection has failed. Event details and status information (see  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections ) provide additional detail. A common reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks of IPv4 addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR block for the VPC in your AWS account. For more information on VPC peering failures, see `https\://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html>`__   
               
              * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_DELETED -- A VPC peering connection has been successfully deleted. 
               

               

               **Spot instance events:**  

               

               
              * INSTANCE_INTERRUPTED -- A spot instance was interrupted by EC2 with a two-minute notification. 
               

               

               **Other fleet events:**  

               

               
              * FLEET_SCALING_EVENT -- A change was made to the fleet's capacity settings (desired instances, minimum/maximum scaling limits). Event messaging includes the new capacity settings. 
               
              * FLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED -- A change was made to the fleet's game session protection policy setting. Event messaging includes both the old and new policy setting.  
               
              * FLEET_DELETED -- A request to delete a fleet was initiated. 
               
              * GENERIC_EVENT -- An unspecified event has occurred.

              Location of stored logs with additional detail that is related to the event. This is useful for debugging issues. The URL is valid for 15 minutes. You can also access fleet creation logs through the GameLift console.

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token that indicates where to resume retrieving results on the next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results represent the end of the list.

          
    
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`GameLift.Client.exceptions.NotFoundException`

  .. py:method:: describe_fleet_location_attributes(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves information on a fleet's remote locations, including life-cycle status and any suspended fleet activity. 

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To get data for specific locations, provide a fleet identifier and a list of locations. Location data is returned in the order that it is requested.  
     
    * To get data for all locations, provide a fleet identifier only. Location data is returned in no particular order.  
     

     

    When requesting attributes for multiple locations, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. 

     

    If successful, a ``LocationAttributes`` object is returned for each requested location. If the fleet does not have a requested location, no information is returned. This operation does not return the home Region. To get information on a fleet's home Region, call ``DescribeFleetAttributes`` .

  .. py:method:: describe_fleet_port_settings(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves a fleet's inbound connection permissions. Connection permissions specify the range of IP addresses and port settings that incoming traffic can use to access server processes in the fleet. Game sessions that are running on instances in the fleet must use connections that fall in this range.

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To retrieve the inbound connection permissions for a fleet, identify the fleet's unique identifier.  
     
    * To check the status of recent updates to a fleet remote location, specify the fleet ID and a location. Port setting updates can take time to propagate across all locations.  
     

     

    If successful, a set of  IpPermission objects is returned for the requested fleet ID. When a location is specified, a pending status is included. If the requested fleet has been deleted, the result set is empty.

  .. py:method:: describe_fleet_utilization(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves utilization statistics for one or more fleets. Utilization data provides a snapshot of how the fleet's hosting resources are currently being used. For fleets with remote locations, this operation retrieves data for the fleet's home Region only. See  DescribeFleetLocationUtilization to get utilization statistics for a fleet's remote locations.

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To get utilization data for one or more specific fleets, provide a list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.  
     
    * To get utilization data for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.  
     

     

    When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. 

     

    If successful, a  FleetUtilization object is returned for each requested fleet ID, unless the fleet identifier is not found. Each fleet utilization object includes a ``Location`` property, which is set to the fleet's home Region. 

     

    .. note::

       

      Some API operations may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the error message includes the maximum allowed.

          - **GameServerId** *(string) --* 

            A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server. Game server IDs are developer-defined and are unique across all game server groups in an AWS account.

            
          

          - **InstanceId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the instance where the game server is running. This ID is available in the instance metadata. EC2 instance IDs use a 17-character format, for example: ``i-1234567890abcdef0`` .

            
          

          - **ConnectionInfo** *(string) --* 

            The port and IP address that must be used to establish a client connection to the game server.

            
          

          - **GameServerData** *(string) --* 

            A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game client or service when it requests information on game servers using  ListGameServers or  ClaimGameServer .

            
          

          - **ClaimStatus** *(string) --* 

            Indicates when an available game server has been reserved for gameplay but has not yet started hosting a game. Once it is claimed, the game server remains in ``CLAIMED`` status for a maximum of one minute. During this time, game clients connect to the game server to start the game and trigger the game server to update its utilization status. After one minute, the game server claim status reverts to null.

            
          

          - **UtilizationStatus** *(string) --* 

            Indicates whether the game server is currently available for new games or is busy. Possible statuses include:

             

             
            * ``AVAILABLE`` - The game server is available to be claimed. A game server that has been claimed remains in this status until it reports game hosting activity.  
             
            * ``UTILIZED`` - The game server is currently hosting a game session with players.  
             

            
          

          - **RegistrationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            Timestamp that indicates when the game server was created with a  RegisterGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ).

            
          

          - **LastClaimTime** *(datetime) --* 

            Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was claimed with a  ClaimGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ). This value is used to calculate when a claimed game server's status should revert to null.

            
          

          - **LastHealthCheckTime** *(datetime) --* 

            Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was updated with health status using an  UpdateGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ). After game server registration, this property is only changed when a game server update specifies a health check value.

          - **GameServerGroupName** *(string) --* 

            A developer-defined identifier for the game server group. The name is unique for each Region in each AWS account.

            
          

          - **GameServerGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            A generated unique ID for the game server group.

            
          

          - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (`ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

            
          

          - **InstanceDefinitions** *(list) --* 

            The set of EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ can use when balancing and automatically scaling instances in the corresponding Auto Scaling group. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

               **This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game server groups.**  

               

              An allowed instance type for a  GameServerGroup . All game server groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of viable instance types.

              
              

              - **InstanceType** *(string) --* 

                An EC2 instance type designation.

                
              

              - **WeightedCapacity** *(string) --* 

                Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effective options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see `Instance Weighting <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default value is "1".

                
          
        
          

          - **BalancingStrategy** *(string) --* 

            Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:

             

             
            * ``SPOT_ONLY`` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced. 
             
            * ``SPOT_PREFERRED`` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances. 
             
            * ``ON_DEMAND_ONLY`` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force. 
             

            
          

          - **GameServerProtectionPolicy** *(string) --* 

            A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. 

            
          

          - **AutoScalingGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            A generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is associated with this game server group.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the game server group. Possible statuses include:

             

             
            * ``NEW`` - GameLift FleetIQ has validated the ``CreateGameServerGroup()`` request.  
             
            * ``ACTIVATING`` - GameLift FleetIQ is setting up a game server group, which includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account.  
             
            * ``ACTIVE`` - The game server group has been successfully created.  
             
            * ``DELETE_SCHEDULED`` - A request to delete the game server group has been received.  
             
            * ``DELETING`` - GameLift FleetIQ has received a valid ``DeleteGameServerGroup()`` request and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ must first complete and release hosts before it deletes the Auto Scaling group and the game server group.  
             
            * ``DELETED`` - The game server group has been successfully deleted.  
             
            * ``ERROR`` - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a game server group has failed, resulting in an error state. 
             

            
          

          - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

            Additional information about the current game server group status. This information might provide additional insight on groups that are in ``ERROR`` status.

            
          

          - **SuspendedActions** *(list) --* 

            A list of activities that are currently suspended for this game server group. If this property is empty, all activities are occurring.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ).

            
          

          - **LastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A timestamp that indicates when this game server group was last updated.

  .. py:method:: describe_game_server_instances(**kwargs)

    

     **This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.**  

     

    Retrieves status information about the Amazon EC2 instances associated with a GameLift FleetIQ game server group. Use this operation to detect when instances are active or not available to host new game servers. If you are looking for instance configuration information, call  DescribeGameServerGroup or access the corresponding Auto Scaling group properties.

     

    To request status for all instances in the game server group, provide a game server group ID only. To request status for specific instances, provide the game server group ID and one or more instance IDs. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results in sequential segments. If successful, a collection of ``GameServerInstance`` objects is returned. 

     

    This operation is not designed to be called with every game server claim request; this practice can cause you to exceed your API limit, which results in errors. Instead, as a best practice, cache the results and refresh your cache no more than once every 10 seconds.

When the instance is put in DRAINING, a new instance is started up to replace it. Once the instance has no UTILIZED game servers, it will be terminated in favor of the new instance. 
               
              * **SPOT_TERMINATING** -- The instance is in the process of shutting down due to a Spot instance interruption. No new game servers are started on this instance.

  .. py:method:: describe_game_session_details(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves additional game session properties, including the game session protection policy in force, a set of one or more game sessions in a specific fleet location. You can optionally filter the results by current game session status. Alternatively, use  SearchGameSessions to request a set of active game sessions that are filtered by certain criteria. To retrieve all game session properties, use  DescribeGameSessions . 

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To retrieve details for all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID, with an optional status filter. This approach returns details from the fleet's home Region and all remote locations. 
     
    * To retrieve details for all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, with optional status filter. The location can be the fleet's home Region or any remote location. 
     
    * To retrieve details for a specific game session, provide the game session ID. This approach looks for the game session ID in all fleets that reside in the AWS Region defined in the request. 
     

     

    Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. 

     

    If successful, a ``GameSessionDetail`` object is returned for each game session that matches the request.

            * **FULFILLED** -- A new game session and player sessions (if requested) have been successfully created. Values for *GameSessionArn* and *GameSessionRegion* are available.  
             
            * **CANCELLED** -- The placement request was canceled with a call to  StopGameSessionPlacement . 
             
            * **TIMED_OUT** -- A new game session was not successfully created before the time limit expired. You can resubmit the placement request as needed. 
             
            * **FAILED** -- GameLift is not able to complete the process of placing the game session. Common reasons are the game session terminated before the placement process was completed, or an unexpected internal error. 
             

            
          

          - **GameProperties** *(list) --* 

            A set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__ ).

ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name>`` . In a GameLift game session queue ARN, the resource ID matches the *Name* value.

              
            

            - **TimeoutInSeconds** *(integer) --* 

              The maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement request remains in the queue. When a request exceeds this time, the game session placement changes to a ``TIMED_OUT`` status.

              
            

            - **PlayerLatencyPolicies** *(list) --* 

              A set of policies that act as a sliding cap on player latency. FleetIQ works to deliver low latency for most players in a game session. These policies ensure that no individual player can be placed into a game with unreasonably high latency. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency requirements a step at a time. Multiple policies are applied based on their maximum allowed latency, starting with the lowest value. 

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Sets a latency cap for individual players when placing a game session. With a latency policy in force, a game session cannot be placed in a fleet location where a player reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are used only with placement request that provide player latency information. Player latency policies can be stacked to gradually relax latency requirements over time. 

                 

                Latency policies are part of a  GameSessionQueue .

                
                

                - **MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds** *(integer) --* 

                  The maximum latency value that is allowed for any player, in milliseconds. All policies must have a value set for this property.

                  
                

                - **PolicyDurationSeconds** *(integer) --* 

                  The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. A null value for this property means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.

                  
            
          
            

            - **Destinations** *(list) --* 

              A list of fleets and/or fleet aliases that can be used to fulfill game session placement requests in the queue. Destinations are identified by either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias ARN, and are listed in order of placement preference.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A fleet or alias designated in a game session queue. Queues fulfill requests for new game sessions by placing a new game session on any of the queue's destinations. 

                 

                Destinations are part of a  GameSessionQueue .

                
                

                - **DestinationArn** *(string) --* 

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is assigned to fleet or fleet alias. ARNs, which include a fleet ID or alias ID and a Region name, provide a unique identifier across all Regions. 

                  
            
          
            

            - **FilterConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

              A list of locations where a queue is allowed to place new game sessions. Locations are specified in the form of AWS Region codes, such as ``us-west-2`` . If this parameter is not set, game sessions can be placed in any queue location. 

              
              

              - **AllowedLocations** *(list) --* 

                A list of locations to allow game session placement in, in the form of AWS Region codes such as ``us-west-2`` .

            - **PriorityConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

              Custom settings to use when prioritizing destinations and locations for game session placements. This configuration replaces the FleetIQ default prioritization process. Priority types that are not explicitly named will be automatically applied at the end of the prioritization process. 

              
              

              - **PriorityOrder** *(list) --* 

                The recommended sequence to use when prioritizing where to place new game sessions. Each type can only be listed once.

                 

                 
                * ``LATENCY`` -- FleetIQ prioritizes locations where the average player latency (provided in each game session request) is lowest.  
                 
                * ``COST`` -- FleetIQ prioritizes destinations with the lowest current hosting costs. Cost is evaluated based on the location, instance type, and fleet type (Spot or On-Demand) for each destination in the queue. 
                 
                * ``DESTINATION`` -- FleetIQ prioritizes based on the order that destinations are listed in the queue configuration.

  .. py:method:: describe_game_sessions(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves a set of one or more game sessions in a specific fleet location. You can optionally filter the results by current game session status. Alternatively, use  SearchGameSessions to request a set of active game sessions that are filtered by certain criteria. To retrieve the protection policy for game sessions, use  DescribeGameSessionDetails .

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To retrieve all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID, with an optional status filter. This approach returns all game sessions in the fleet's home Region and all remote locations. 
     
    * To retrieve all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, with optional status filter. The location can be the fleet's home Region or any remote location. 
     
    * To retrieve a specific game session, provide the game session ID. This approach looks for the game session ID in all fleets that reside in the AWS Region defined in the request. 
     

     

    Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. 

     

    If successful, a ``GameSession`` object is returned for each game session that matches the request.

     

     *Available in GameLift Local.*

            - **CreatorId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can create.

              
            

            - **GameSessionData** *(string) --* 

              A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session.

              
            

            - **MatchmakerData** *(string) --* 

              Information about the matchmaking process that was used to create the game session. It is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. In addition the matchmaking configuration used, it contains data on all players assigned to the match, including player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see `Match Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-server.html#match-server-data>`__ . Matchmaker data is useful when requesting match backfills, and is updated whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see  StartMatchBackfill ). 

              
            

            - **Location** *(string) --*

            - **FleetId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for the fleet that the instance is in.

              
            

            - **FleetArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (`ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912`` .

              
            

            - **InstanceId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for the instance.

              
            

            - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

              IP address that is assigned to the instance.

              
            

            - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

              The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:

               

               
              * TLS-enabled fleets: ``<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com`` .

              * **ACTIVE** -- The instance has been successfully created and at least one server process has successfully launched and reported back to GameLift that it is ready to host a game session. The instance is now considered ready to host game sessions.  
               
              * **TERMINATING** -- The instance is in the process of shutting down. This may happen to reduce capacity during a scaling down event or to recycle resources in the event of a problem. 
               

              
            

            - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ).

              
            

            - **Location** *(string) --* 

              The fleet location of the instance, expressed as an AWS Region code, such as ``us-west-2`` .

  .. py:method:: describe_matchmaking(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves one or more matchmaking tickets. Use this operation to retrieve ticket information, including--after a successful match is made--connection information for the resulting new game session. 

     

    To request matchmaking tickets, provide a list of up to 10 ticket IDs. If the request is successful, a ticket object is returned for each requested ID that currently exists.

     

    This operation is not designed to be continually called to track matchmaking ticket status. This practice can cause you to exceed your API limit, which results in errors. Instead, as a best practice, set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to receive notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration. Continuously poling ticket status with  DescribeMatchmaking should only be used for games in development with low matchmaking usage.

                - **Team** *(string) --* 

                  Name of the team that the player is assigned to in a match. Team names are defined in a matchmaking rule set.

                  
                

                - **LatencyInMs** *(dict) --* 

                  A set of values, expressed in milliseconds, that indicates the amount of latency that a player experiences when connected to AWS Regions. If this property is present, FlexMatch considers placing the match only in Regions for which latency is reported. 

                   

                  If a matchmaker has a rule that evaluates player latency, players must report latency in order to be matched. If no latency is reported in this scenario, FlexMatch assumes that no Regions are available to the player and the ticket is not matchable.

This parameter is not set when FlexMatch is being used without GameLift hosting.

              
              

              - **GameSessionArn** *(string) --* 

                A unique identifier for the game session. Use the game session ID.

                
              

              - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

                The IP address of the game session. To connect to a GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

                
              

              - **DnsName** *(string) --*

                * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: ``ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com`` . (See `Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses>`__ .) 
                 

                 

                When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

                
              

              - **Port** *(integer) --* 

                The port number for the game session. To connect to a GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

                
              

              - **MatchedPlayerSessions** *(list) --* 

                A collection of player session IDs, one for each player ID that was included in the original matchmaking request. 

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  Represents a new player session that is created as a result of a successful FlexMatch match. A successful match automatically creates new player sessions for every player ID in the original matchmaking request. 

                   

                  When players connect to the match's game session, they must include both player ID and player session ID in order to claim their assigned player slot.

                  
                  

                  - **PlayerId** *(string) --* 

                    A unique identifier for a player 

                    
                  

                  - **PlayerSessionId** *(string) --* 

                    A unique identifier for a player session

                    
              
            
          
            

            - **EstimatedWaitTime** *(integer) --* 

              Average amount of time (in seconds) that players are currently waiting for a match. If there is not enough recent data, this property may be empty.

      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents the returned data in response to a request operation.

        
        

        - **RuleSets** *(list) --* 

          A collection of requested matchmaking rule set objects. 

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Set of rule statements, used with FlexMatch, that determine how to build your player matches. Each rule set describes a type of group to be created and defines the parameters for acceptable player matches. Rule sets are used in  MatchmakingConfiguration objects.

             

            A rule set may define the following elements for a match. For detailed information and examples showing how to construct a rule set, see `Build a FlexMatch rule set <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-rulesets.html>`__ . 

             

             
            * Teams -- Required. A rule set must define one or multiple teams for the match and set minimum and maximum team sizes. For example, a rule set might describe a 4x4 match that requires all eight slots to be filled.  
             
            * Player attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set of player characteristics to evaluate when looking for a match. Matchmaking requests that use a rule set with player attributes must provide the corresponding attribute values. For example, an attribute might specify a player's skill or level. 
             
            * Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a match based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for individual players, teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might require each player to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least one player in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may describe an entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at least one player in a certain role.  
             
            * Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a period of time when no acceptable matches are found. This feature lets you balance getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of making them wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill variance between players after 30 seconds.

  .. py:method:: describe_player_sessions(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves properties for one or more player sessions. 

     

    This action can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To retrieve a specific player session, provide the player session ID only. 
     
    * To retrieve all player sessions in a game session, provide the game session ID only. 
     
    * To retrieve all player sessions for a specific player, provide a player ID only. 
     

     

    To request player sessions, specify either a player session ID, game session ID, or player ID. You can filter this request by player session status. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. 

     

    If successful, a ``PlayerSession`` object is returned for each session that matches the request.

  .. py:method:: describe_scaling_policies(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves all scaling policies applied to a fleet.

     

    To get a fleet's scaling policies, specify the fleet ID. You can filter this request by policy status, such as to retrieve only active scaling policies. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, set of  ScalingPolicy objects is returned for the fleet.

     

    A fleet may have all of its scaling policies suspended ( StopFleetActions ). This operation does not affect the status of the scaling policies, which remains ACTIVE. To see whether a fleet's scaling policies are in force or suspended, call  DescribeFleetAttributes and check the stopped actions.

  .. py:method:: get_instance_access(**kwargs)

    

    Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for debugging, gathering benchmarking data, or observing activity in real time. 

     

    To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the operating system of the instance. For a Windows instance, GameLift returns a user name and password as strings for use with a Windows Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, GameLift returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with an SSH client. The private key must be saved in the proper format to a ``.pem`` file before using. If you're making this request using the AWS CLI, saving the secret can be handled as part of the ``GetInstanceAccess`` request, as shown in one of the examples for this operation. 

     

    To request access to a specific instance, specify the IDs of both the instance and the fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve a fleet's instance IDs by calling  DescribeInstances . If successful, an  InstanceAccess object is returned that contains the instance's IP address and a set of credentials.

  .. py:method:: list_fleets(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves a collection of fleet resources in an AWS Region. You can call this operation to get fleets in a previously selected default Region (see `https\://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/setting-global-region.html <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/setting-global-region.html>`__ or specify a Region in your request. You can filter the result set to find only those fleets that are deployed with a specific build or script. For fleets that have multiple locations, this operation retrieves fleets based on their home Region only.

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To get a list of all fleets in a Region, don't provide a build or script identifier.  
     
    * To get a list of all fleets where a specific custom game build is deployed, provide the build ID. 
     
    * To get a list of all Realtime Servers fleets with a specific configuration script, provide the script ID.  
     

     

    Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. 

     

    If successful, a list of fleet IDs that match the request parameters is returned. A NextToken value is also returned if there are more result pages to retrieve.

     

    .. note::

       

      Fleet resources are not listed in a particular order.

If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced. 
               
              * ``SPOT_PREFERRED`` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances. 
               
              * ``ON_DEMAND_ONLY`` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force. 
               

              
            

            - **GameServerProtectionPolicy** *(string) --* 

              A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. 

              
            

            - **AutoScalingGroupArn** *(string) --* 

              A generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is associated with this game server group.

              
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              The current status of the game server group. Possible statuses include:

               

               
              * ``NEW`` - GameLift FleetIQ has validated the ``CreateGameServerGroup()`` request.  
               
              * ``ACTIVATING`` - GameLift FleetIQ is setting up a game server group, which includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account.  
               
              * ``ACTIVE`` - The game server group has been successfully created.  
               
              * ``DELETE_SCHEDULED`` - A request to delete the game server group has been received.  
               
              * ``DELETING`` - GameLift FleetIQ has received a valid ``DeleteGameServerGroup()`` request and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ must first complete and release hosts before it deletes the Auto Scaling group and the game server group.  
               
              * ``DELETED`` - The game server group has been successfully deleted.  
               
              * ``ERROR`` - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a game server group has failed, resulting in an error state. 
               

              
            

            - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

              Additional information about the current game server group status. This information might provide additional insight on groups that are in ``ERROR`` status.

              
            

            - **SuspendedActions** *(list) --* 

              A list of activities that are currently suspended for this game server group. If this property is empty, all activities are occurring.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
            

            - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --*

            - **LastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

              A timestamp that indicates when this game server group was last updated.

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token that indicates where to resume retrieving results on the next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results represent the end of the list.

              Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was claimed with a  ClaimGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ). This value is used to calculate when a claimed game server's status should revert to null.

              
            

            - **LastHealthCheckTime** *(datetime) --* 

              Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was updated with health status using an  UpdateGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ). After game server registration, this property is only changed when a game server update specifies a health check value.

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --*

  .. py:method:: put_scaling_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. 

     

    Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.

     

    You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling  StopFleetActions with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call  StartFleetActions with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with  DeleteScalingPolicy .

     

    Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in `Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html>`__ .

     

     **Target-based policy**  

     

    A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. 

     

    For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. 

     

    To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a  TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

     

     **Rule-based policy**  

     

    A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. 

     

    For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%."

     

    A policy's rule statement has the following structure:

     

    If ``[MetricName]`` is ``[ComparisonOperator]``  ``[Threshold]`` for ``[EvaluationPeriods]`` minutes, then ``[ScalingAdjustmentType]`` to/by ``[ScalingAdjustment]`` .

     

    To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:

     

    If ``[PercentIdleInstances]`` is ``[GreaterThanThreshold]``  ``[20]`` for ``[15]`` minutes, then ``[PercentChangeInCapacity]`` to/by ``[10]`` .

     

    To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

  .. py:method:: register_game_server(**kwargs)

    

     **This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.**  

     

    Creates a new game server resource and notifies GameLift FleetIQ that the game server is ready to host gameplay and players. This operation is called by a game server process that is running on an instance in a game server group. Registering game servers enables GameLift FleetIQ to track available game servers and enables game clients and services to claim a game server for a new game session. 

     

    To register a game server, identify the game server group and instance where the game server is running, and provide a unique identifier for the game server. You can also include connection and game server data. When a game client or service requests a game server by calling  ClaimGameServer , this information is returned in the response.

     

    Once a game server is successfully registered, it is put in status ``AVAILABLE`` . A request to register a game server may fail if the instance it is running on is in the process of shutting down as part of instance balancing or scale-down activity.

  .. py:method:: resume_game_server_group(**kwargs)

    

     **This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.**  

     

    Reinstates activity on a game server group after it has been suspended. A game server group might be suspended by the SuspendGameServerGroup operation, or it might be suspended involuntarily due to a configuration problem. In the second case, you can manually resume activity on the group once the configuration problem has been resolved. Refer to the game server group status and status reason for more information on why group activity is suspended.

     

    To resume activity, specify a game server group ARN and the type of activity to be resumed. If successful, a  GameServerGroup object is returned showing that the resumed activity is no longer listed in ``SuspendedActions`` .

            A developer-defined identifier for the game server group. The name is unique for each Region in each AWS account.

            
          

          - **GameServerGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            A generated unique ID for the game server group.

            
          

          - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (`ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

            
          

          - **InstanceDefinitions** *(list) --* 

            The set of EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ can use when balancing and automatically scaling instances in the corresponding Auto Scaling group. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

               **This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game server groups.**  

               

              An allowed instance type for a  GameServerGroup . All game server groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of viable instance types.

              
              

              - **InstanceType** *(string) --* 

                An EC2 instance type designation.

                
              

              - **WeightedCapacity** *(string) --* 

                Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effective options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see `Instance Weighting <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default value is "1".

                
          
        
          

          - **BalancingStrategy** *(string) --* 

            Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:

             

             
            * ``SPOT_ONLY`` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced. 
             
            * ``SPOT_PREFERRED`` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances. 
             
            * ``ON_DEMAND_ONLY`` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force. 
             

            
          

          - **GameServerProtectionPolicy** *(string) --* 

            A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. 

            
          

          - **AutoScalingGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            A generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is associated with this game server group.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the game server group. Possible statuses include:

             

             
            * ``NEW`` - GameLift FleetIQ has validated the ``CreateGameServerGroup()`` request.  
             
            * ``ACTIVATING`` - GameLift FleetIQ is setting up a game server group, which includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account.  
             
            * ``ACTIVE`` - The game server group has been successfully created.  
             
            * ``DELETE_SCHEDULED`` - A request to delete the game server group has been received.  
             
            * ``DELETING`` - GameLift FleetIQ has received a valid ``DeleteGameServerGroup()`` request and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ must first complete and release hosts before it deletes the Auto Scaling group and the game server group.  
             
            * ``DELETED`` - The game server group has been successfully deleted.  
             
            * ``ERROR`` - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a game server group has failed, resulting in an error state. 
             

            
          

          - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

            Additional information about the current game server group status. This information might provide additional insight on groups that are in ``ERROR`` status.

            
          

          - **SuspendedActions** *(list) --* 

            A list of activities that are currently suspended for this game server group. If this property is empty, all activities are occurring.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ).

            
          

          - **LastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A timestamp that indicates when this game server group was last updated.

  .. py:method:: search_game_sessions(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria and sorts them into a specified order. 

     

    When searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to search and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all of a fleet's locations. 

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To search all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach returns game sessions in the fleet's home Region and all remote locations that fit the search criteria. 
     
    * To search all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name. For location, you can specify a fleet's home Region or any remote location. 
     

     

    Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. 

     

    If successful, a ``GameSession`` object is returned for each game session that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in ``ACTIVE`` status only. To retrieve information on game sessions in other statuses, use  DescribeGameSessions .

     

    You can search or sort by the following game session attributes:

     

     
    * **gameSessionId** -- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a ``GameSessionId`` or ``GameSessionArn`` value.  
     
    * **gameSessionName** -- Name assigned to a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with  CreateGameSession or updating with  UpdateGameSession . Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session. 
     
    * **gameSessionProperties** -- Custom data defined in a game session's ``GameProperty`` parameter. ``GameProperty`` values are stored as key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the key and a string to search the data values for. For example, to search for game sessions with custom data containing the key:value pair "gameMode:brawl", specify the following: ``gameSessionProperties.gameMode = "brawl"`` . All custom data values are searched as strings. 
     
    * **maximumSessions** -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with  CreateGameSession or updating with  UpdateGameSession . 
     
    * **creationTimeMillis** -- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds. 
     
    * **playerSessionCount** -- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out. 
     
    * **hasAvailablePlayerSessions** -- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join.  
     

     

    .. note::

       

      Returned values for ``playerSessionCount`` and ``hasAvailablePlayerSessions`` change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to refresh search results often, and handle sessions that fill up before a player can join.

      A unique identifier for the fleet to search for active game sessions. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

      

    
    :type AliasId: string
    :param AliasId: 

      A unique identifier for the alias associated with the fleet to search for active game sessions. You can use either the alias ID or ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

      

    
    :type Location: string
    :param Location: 

      A fleet location to search for game sessions. You can specify a fleet's home Region or a remote location. Use the AWS Region code format, such as ``us-west-2`` . 

       

       

      

    
    :type FilterExpression: string
    :param FilterExpression: 

      String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in ``ACTIVE`` status.

       

      A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists of the following:

       

       
      * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are ``gameSessionName`` , ``gameSessionId`` , ``gameSessionProperties`` , ``maximumSessions`` , ``creationTimeMillis`` , ``playerSessionCount`` , ``hasAvailablePlayerSessions`` . 
       
      * **Comparator** -- Valid comparators are: ``=`` , ``<>`` , ``<`` , ``>`` , ``<=`` , ``>=`` .  
       
      * **Value** -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators ``=`` and ``<>`` . For example, the following filter expression searches on ``gameSessionName`` : "``FilterExpression": "gameSessionName = 'Matt\\'s Awesome Game 1'"`` .  
       

       

      To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords ``AND`` , ``OR`` , and ``NOT`` and parentheses as needed. For example: ``x AND y AND NOT z`` , ``NOT (x OR y)`` .

       

      Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:

       

       
      * ``=`` , ``<>`` , ``<`` , ``>`` , ``<=`` , ``>=``   
       
      * Parentheses 
       
      * NOT 
       
      * AND 
       
      * OR 
       

       

      For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: ``"maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true"`` . 

      

    
    :type SortExpression: string
    :param SortExpression: 

      Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression is included, the request returns results in random order. A sort expression consists of the following elements:

       

       
      * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are ``gameSessionName`` , ``gameSessionId`` , ``gameSessionProperties`` , ``maximumSessions`` , ``creationTimeMillis`` , ``playerSessionCount`` , ``hasAvailablePlayerSessions`` . 
       
      * **Order** -- Valid sort orders are ``ASC`` (ascending) and ``DESC`` (descending). 
       

       

      For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions first: ``"SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC"`` . Results with a null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.

      

    
    :type Limit: integer
    :param Limit: 

      The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with ``NextToken`` to get results as a set of sequential pages. The maximum number of results returned is 20, even if this value is not set or is set higher than 20. 

      

    
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      A token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.

            - **CreatorId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can create.

              
            

            - **GameSessionData** *(string) --* 

              A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session.

              
            

            - **MatchmakerData** *(string) --* 

              Information about the matchmaking process that was used to create the game session. It is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. In addition the matchmaking configuration used, it contains data on all players assigned to the match, including player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see `Match Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-server.html#match-server-data>`__ . Matchmaker data is useful when requesting match backfills, and is updated whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see  StartMatchBackfill ). 

              
            

            - **Location** *(string) --* 

              The fleet location where the game session is running. This value might specify the fleet's home Region or a remote location. Location is expressed as an AWS Region code such as ``us-west-2`` . 

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token that indicates where to resume retrieving results on the next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results represent the end of the list.

  .. py:method:: start_fleet_actions(**kwargs)

    

    Resumes certain types of activity on fleet instances that were suspended with  StopFleetActions . For multi-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location. Currently, this operation is used to restart a fleet's auto-scaling activity.

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To restart actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a fleet ID and the type of actions to resume.  
     
    * To restart actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to resume.  
     

     

    If successful, GameLift once again initiates scaling events as triggered by the fleet's scaling policies. If actions on the fleet location were never stopped, this operation will have no effect. You can view a fleet's stopped actions using  DescribeFleetAttributes or  DescribeFleetLocationAttributes .

  .. py:method:: start_game_session_placement(**kwargs)

    

    Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see  CreateGameSessionQueue ). When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out.

     

    A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request.

     

    When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order.

     

    Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players. 

     

    To place a new game session request, specify the following:

     

     
    * The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings 
     
    * A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the placement request 
     
    * (Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for each player) 
     
    * Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players) 
     

     

    If successful, a new game session placement is created.

     

    To track the status of a placement request, call  DescribeGameSessionPlacement and check the request's status. If the status is ``FULFILLED`` , a new game session has been created and a game session ARN and Region are referenced. If the placement request times out, you can resubmit the request or retry it with a different queue.

  .. py:method:: start_match_backfill(**kwargs)

    

    Finds new players to fill open slots in currently running game sessions. The backfill match process is essentially identical to the process of forming new matches. Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements. 

     

    When using FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a  GameSession identifier. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the ``GameSession`` resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request.

     

    When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled.

     

    To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the ``GameSession`` ARN. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches.

        - **LatencyInMs** *(dict) --* 

          A set of values, expressed in milliseconds, that indicates the amount of latency that a player experiences when connected to AWS Regions. If this property is present, FlexMatch considers placing the match only in Regions for which latency is reported. 

           

          If a matchmaker has a rule that evaluates player latency, players must report latency in order to be matched. If no latency is reported in this scenario, FlexMatch assumes that no Regions are available to the player and the ticket is not matchable.

            - **GameSessionArn** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for the game session. Use the game session ID.

              
            

            - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

              The IP address of the game session. To connect to a GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

              
            

            - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

              The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:

  .. py:method:: start_matchmaking(**kwargs)

    

    Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules. With games that use GameLift managed hosting, this operation also triggers GameLift to find hosting resources and start a new game session for the new match. Each matchmaking request includes information on one or more players and specifies the FlexMatch matchmaker to use. When a request is for multiple players, FlexMatch attempts to build a match that includes all players in the request, placing them in the same team and finding additional players as needed to fill the match. 

     

    To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include any player attributes that are required by the matchmaking configuration's rule set. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to ``QUEUED`` . 

     

    Track matchmaking events to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches. Ticket status updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), which is defined in the matchmaking configuration.

        - **LatencyInMs** *(dict) --* 

          A set of values, expressed in milliseconds, that indicates the amount of latency that a player experiences when connected to AWS Regions. If this property is present, FlexMatch considers placing the match only in Regions for which latency is reported. 

           

          If a matchmaker has a rule that evaluates player latency, players must report latency in order to be matched. If no latency is reported in this scenario, FlexMatch assumes that no Regions are available to the player and the ticket is not matchable.

              - **Team** *(string) --* 

                Name of the team that the player is assigned to in a match. Team names are defined in a matchmaking rule set.

                
              

              - **LatencyInMs** *(dict) --* 

                A set of values, expressed in milliseconds, that indicates the amount of latency that a player experiences when connected to AWS Regions. If this property is present, FlexMatch considers placing the match only in Regions for which latency is reported. 

                 

                If a matchmaker has a rule that evaluates player latency, players must report latency in order to be matched. If no latency is reported in this scenario, FlexMatch assumes that no Regions are available to the player and the ticket is not matchable. 

                
                

                - *(string) --*

This parameter is not set when FlexMatch is being used without GameLift hosting.

            
            

            - **GameSessionArn** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for the game session. Use the game session ID.

              
            

            - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

              The IP address of the game session. To connect to a GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

              
            

            - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

              The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:

               

               
              * TLS-enabled fleets: ``<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com`` . 
               
              * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: ``ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com`` . (See `Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses>`__ .) 
               

               

              When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

              
            

            - **Port** *(integer) --* 

              The port number for the game session. To connect to a GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

              
            

            - **MatchedPlayerSessions** *(list) --* 

              A collection of player session IDs, one for each player ID that was included in the original matchmaking request. 

              
              

              - *(dict) --*

  .. py:method:: stop_fleet_actions(**kwargs)

    

    Suspends certain types of activity in a fleet location. Currently, this operation is used to stop auto-scaling activity. For multi-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location. 

     

    Stopping fleet actions has several potential purposes. It allows you to temporarily stop auto-scaling activity but retain your scaling policies for use in the future. For multi-location fleets, you can set up fleet-wide auto-scaling, and then opt out of it for certain locations. 

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To stop actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a fleet ID and the type of actions to suspend.  
     
    * To stop actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to suspend.  
     

     

    If successful, GameLift no longer initiates scaling events except in response to manual changes using  UpdateFleetCapacity . You can view a fleet's stopped actions using  DescribeFleetAttributes or  DescribeFleetLocationAttributes . Suspended activity can be restarted using  StartFleetActions .

     **This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.**  

     

    Temporarily stops activity on a game server group without terminating instances or the game server group. You can restart activity by calling  ResumeGameServerGroup . You can suspend the following activity:

     

     
    * **Instance type replacement** - This activity evaluates the current game hosting viability of all Spot instance types that are defined for the game server group. It updates the Auto Scaling group to remove nonviable Spot Instance types, which have a higher chance of game server interruptions. It then balances capacity across the remaining viable Spot Instance types. When this activity is suspended, the Auto Scaling group continues with its current balance, regardless of viability. Instance protection, utilization metrics, and capacity scaling activities continue to be active.  
     

     

    To suspend activity, specify a game server group ARN and the type of activity to be suspended. If successful, a  GameServerGroup object is returned showing that the activity is listed in ``SuspendedActions`` .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **GameServerGroup** *(dict) --* 

          An object that describes the game server group resource, with the ``SuspendedActions`` property updated to reflect the suspended activity.

          
          

          - **GameServerGroupName** *(string) --* 

            A developer-defined identifier for the game server group. The name is unique for each Region in each AWS account.

            
          

          - **GameServerGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            A generated unique ID for the game server group.

            
          

          - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (`ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

            
          

          - **InstanceDefinitions** *(list) --* 

            The set of EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ can use when balancing and automatically scaling instances in the corresponding Auto Scaling group. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

               **This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game server groups.**  

               

              An allowed instance type for a  GameServerGroup . All game server groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of viable instance types.

              
              

              - **InstanceType** *(string) --* 

                An EC2 instance type designation.

                
              

              - **WeightedCapacity** *(string) --* 

                Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effective options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see `Instance Weighting <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default value is "1".

                
          
        
          

          - **BalancingStrategy** *(string) --* 

            Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:

             

             
            * ``SPOT_ONLY`` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced. 
             
            * ``SPOT_PREFERRED`` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances. 
             
            * ``ON_DEMAND_ONLY`` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force. 
             

            
          

          - **GameServerProtectionPolicy** *(string) --* 

            A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. 

            
          

          - **AutoScalingGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            A generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is associated with this game server group.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the game server group. Possible statuses include:

             

             
            * ``NEW`` - GameLift FleetIQ has validated the ``CreateGameServerGroup()`` request.  
             
            * ``ACTIVATING`` - GameLift FleetIQ is setting up a game server group, which includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account.  
             
            * ``ACTIVE`` - The game server group has been successfully created.  
             
            * ``DELETE_SCHEDULED`` - A request to delete the game server group has been received.  
             
            * ``DELETING`` - GameLift FleetIQ has received a valid ``DeleteGameServerGroup()`` request and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ must first complete and release hosts before it deletes the Auto Scaling group and the game server group.  
             
            * ``DELETED`` - The game server group has been successfully deleted.  
             
            * ``ERROR`` - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a game server group has failed, resulting in an error state. 
             

            
          

          - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

            Additional information about the current game server group status. This information might provide additional insight on groups that are in ``ERROR`` status.

            
          

          - **SuspendedActions** *(list) --* 

            A list of activities that are currently suspended for this game server group. If this property is empty, all activities are occurring.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ).

            
          

          - **LastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A timestamp that indicates when this game server group was last updated.

  .. py:method:: tag_resource(**kwargs)

    

    Assigns a tag to a GameLift resource. AWS resource tags provide an additional management tool set. You can use tags to organize resources, create IAM permissions policies to manage access to groups of resources, customize AWS cost breakdowns, etc. This operation handles the permissions necessary to manage tags for the following GameLift resource types:

     

     
    * Build 
     
    * Script 
     
    * Fleet 
     
    * Alias 
     
    * GameSessionQueue 
     
    * MatchmakingConfiguration 
     
    * MatchmakingRuleSet 
     

     

    To add a tag to a resource, specify the unique ARN value for the resource and provide a tag list containing one or more tags. The operation succeeds even if the list includes tags that are already assigned to the specified resource.

              * **SIMPLE** - The alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this type when routing to active fleets. 
               
              * **TERMINAL** - The alias does not resolve to a fleet but instead can be used to display a message to the user. A terminal alias throws a TerminalRoutingStrategyException with the  RoutingStrategy message embedded. 
               

              
            

            - **FleetId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for the fleet that the alias points to. This value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

              
            

            - **Message** *(string) --*

  .. py:method:: update_fleet_capacity(**kwargs)

    

    Updates capacity settings for a fleet. For fleets with multiple locations, use this operation to manage capacity settings in each location individually. Fleet capacity determines the number of game sessions and players that can be hosted based on the fleet configuration. Use this operation to set the following fleet capacity properties: 

     

     
    * Minimum/maximum size: Set hard limits on fleet capacity. GameLift cannot set the fleet's capacity to a value outside of this range, whether the capacity is changed manually or through automatic scaling.  
     
    * Desired capacity: Manually set the number of EC2 instances to be maintained in a fleet location. Before changing a fleet's desired capacity, you may want to call  DescribeEC2InstanceLimits to get the maximum capacity of the fleet's EC2 instance type. Alternatively, consider using automatic scaling to adjust capacity based on player demand. 
     

     

    This operation can be used in the following ways: 

     

     
    * To update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the fleet has no remote locations, omit the ``Location`` parameter. The fleet must be in ``ACTIVE`` status.  
     
    * To update capacity for a fleet's remote location, include the ``Location`` parameter set to the location to be updated. The location must be in ``ACTIVE`` status. 
     

     

    If successful, capacity settings are updated immediately. In response a change in desired capacity, GameLift initiates steps to start new instances or terminate existing instances in the requested fleet location. This continues until the location's active instance count matches the new desired instance count. You can track a fleet's current capacity by calling  DescribeFleetCapacity or  DescribeFleetLocationCapacity . If the requested desired instance count is higher than the instance type's limit, the ``LimitExceeded`` exception occurs.

  .. py:method:: update_game_server(**kwargs)

    

     **This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.**  

     

    Updates information about a registered game server to help GameLift FleetIQ to track game server availability. This operation is called by a game server process that is running on an instance in a game server group. 

     

    Use this operation to update the following types of game server information. You can make all three types of updates in the same request:

     

     
    * To update the game server's utilization status, identify the game server and game server group and specify the current utilization status. Use this status to identify when game servers are currently hosting games and when they are available to be claimed. 
     
    * To report health status, identify the game server and game server group and set health check to ``HEALTHY`` . If a game server does not report health status for a certain length of time, the game server is no longer considered healthy. As a result, it will be eventually deregistered from the game server group to avoid affecting utilization metrics. The best practice is to report health every 60 seconds. 
     
    * To change game server metadata, provide updated game server data. 
     

     

    Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant statuses and timestamps are updated.

  .. py:method:: update_game_server_group(**kwargs)

    

     **This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.**  

     

    Updates GameLift FleetIQ-specific properties for a game server group. Many Auto Scaling group properties are updated on the Auto Scaling group directly, including the launch template, Auto Scaling policies, and maximum/minimum/desired instance counts.

     

    To update the game server group, specify the game server group ID and provide the updated values. Before applying the updates, the new values are validated to ensure that GameLift FleetIQ can continue to perform instance balancing activity. If successful, a  GameServerGroup object is returned.

      An updated list of EC2 instance types to use in the Auto Scaling group. The instance definitions must specify at least two different instance types that are supported by GameLift FleetIQ. This updated list replaces the entire current list of instance definitions for the game server group. For more information on instance types, see `EC2 Instance Types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* . You can optionally specify capacity weighting for each instance type. If no weight value is specified for an instance type, it is set to the default value "1". For more information about capacity weighting, see `Instance Weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html>`__ in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

         **This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game server groups.**  

         

        An allowed instance type for a  GameServerGroup . All game server groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of viable instance types.

        

      
        - **InstanceType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          An EC2 instance type designation.

          

        
        - **WeightedCapacity** *(string) --* 

          Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effective options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see `Instance Weighting <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default value is "1".

          

        
      
  
    :type GameServerProtectionPolicy: string
    :param GameServerProtectionPolicy: 

      A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. This property is set to ``NO_PROTECTION`` by default.

      

    
    :type BalancingStrategy: string
    :param BalancingStrategy: 

      Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:

       

       
      * ``SPOT_ONLY`` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced. 
       
      * ``SPOT_PREFERRED`` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances. 
       
      * ``ON_DEMAND_ONLY`` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.

            The Amazon Resource Name (`ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

            
          

          - **InstanceDefinitions** *(list) --* 

            The set of EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ can use when balancing and automatically scaling instances in the corresponding Auto Scaling group. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

               **This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game server groups.**  

               

              An allowed instance type for a  GameServerGroup . All game server groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of viable instance types.

              
              

              - **InstanceType** *(string) --* 

                An EC2 instance type designation.

                
              

              - **WeightedCapacity** *(string) --* 

                Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effective options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see `Instance Weighting <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default value is "1".

                
          
        
          

          - **BalancingStrategy** *(string) --* 

            Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:

             

             
            * ``SPOT_ONLY`` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced. 
             
            * ``SPOT_PREFERRED`` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances. 
             
            * ``ON_DEMAND_ONLY`` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force. 
             

            
          

          - **GameServerProtectionPolicy** *(string) --* 

            A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. 

            
          

          - **AutoScalingGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            A generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is associated with this game server group.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the game server group. Possible statuses include:

             

             
            * ``NEW`` - GameLift FleetIQ has validated the ``CreateGameServerGroup()`` request.  
             
            * ``ACTIVATING`` - GameLift FleetIQ is setting up a game server group, which includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account.  
             
            * ``ACTIVE`` - The game server group has been successfully created.  
             
            * ``DELETE_SCHEDULED`` - A request to delete the game server group has been received.  
             
            * ``DELETING`` - GameLift FleetIQ has received a valid ``DeleteGameServerGroup()`` request and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ must first complete and release hosts before it deletes the Auto Scaling group and the game server group.  
             
            * ``DELETED`` - The game server group has been successfully deleted.  
             
            * ``ERROR`` - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a game server group has failed, resulting in an error state. 
             

            
          

          - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

            Additional information about the current game server group status. This information might provide additional insight on groups that are in ``ERROR`` status.

            A list of activities that are currently suspended for this game server group. If this property is empty, all activities are occurring.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ).

            
          

          - **LastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A timestamp that indicates when this game server group was last updated.

These policies ensure that no individual player can be placed into a game with unreasonably high latency. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency requirements a step at a time. Multiple policies are applied based on their maximum allowed latency, starting with the lowest value. When updating policies, provide a complete collection of policies.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Sets a latency cap for individual players when placing a game session. With a latency policy in force, a game session cannot be placed in a fleet location where a player reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are used only with placement request that provide player latency information. Player latency policies can be stacked to gradually relax latency requirements over time. 

         

        Latency policies are part of a  GameSessionQueue .

        

      
        - **MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds** *(integer) --* 

          The maximum latency value that is allowed for any player, in milliseconds. All policies must have a value set for this property.

          

        
        - **PolicyDurationSeconds** *(integer) --* 

          The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. A null value for this property means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.

          

        
      
  
    :type Destinations: list
    :param Destinations: 

      A list of fleets and/or fleet aliases that can be used to fulfill game session placement requests in the queue. Destinations are identified by either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias ARN, and are listed in order of placement preference. When updating this list, provide a complete list of destinations.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A fleet or alias designated in a game session queue. Queues fulfill requests for new game sessions by placing a new game session on any of the queue's destinations.

  .. py:method:: update_runtime_configuration(**kwargs)

    

    Updates the current runtime configuration for the specified fleet, which tells GameLift how to launch server processes on all instances in the fleet. You can update a fleet's runtime configuration at any time after the fleet is created; it does not need to be in ``ACTIVE`` status.

     

    To update runtime configuration, specify the fleet ID and provide a ``RuntimeConfiguration`` with an updated set of server process configurations.

     

    If successful, the fleet's runtime configuration settings are updated. Each instance in the fleet regularly checks for and retrieves updated runtime configurations. Instances immediately begin complying with the new configuration by launching new server processes or not replacing existing processes when they shut down. Updating a fleet's runtime configuration never affects existing server processes.

  .. py:method:: update_script(**kwargs)

    

    Updates Realtime script metadata and content.

     

    To update script metadata, specify the script ID and provide updated name and/or version values. 

     

    To update script content, provide an updated zip file by pointing to either a local file or an Amazon S3 bucket location. You can use either method regardless of how the original script was uploaded. Use the *Version* parameter to track updates to the script.

     

    If the call is successful, the updated metadata is stored in the script record and a revised script is uploaded to the Amazon GameLift service. Once the script is updated and acquired by a fleet instance, the new version is used for all new game sessions.

              * FLEET_CREATED -- A fleet resource was successfully created with a status of ``NEW`` . Event messaging includes the fleet ID. 
               
              * FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING -- Fleet status changed from ``NEW`` to ``DOWNLOADING`` . The compressed build has started downloading to a fleet instance for installation. 
               
              * FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build failed to download to the fleet instance. 
               
              * FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files are now being extracted from the uploaded build and saved to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* . 
               
              * FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER – The game server build files were successfully extracted, and the GameLift is now running the build's install script (if one is included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs for this stage list the installation steps and whether or not the install completed successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .  
               
              * FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG -- The build process was successful, and the GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths, which are specified in the fleet's runtime configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths in the runtime configuration and indicate whether each is found. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .  
               
              * FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from ``DOWNLOADING`` to ``VALIDATING`` . 
               
              * FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the runtime configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not exist on the instance. 
               
              * FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from ``VALIDATING`` to ``BUILDING`` . 
               
              * FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE -- Validation of the runtime configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to run on the fleet instance. 
               
              * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from ``BUILDING`` to ``ACTIVATING`` .  
               
              * FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED - The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the steps in the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the game build was successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not able to start a server process.

              * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status changed from ``ACTIVATING`` to ``ACTIVE`` . The fleet is now ready to host game sessions. 
               

               

               **VPC peering events:**  

               

               
              * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has been established between the VPC for an GameLift fleet and a VPC in your AWS account. 
               
              * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connection has failed. Event details and status information (see  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections ) provide additional detail. A common reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks of IPv4 addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR block for the VPC in your AWS account. For more information on VPC peering failures, see `https\://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html>`__   
               
              * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_DELETED -- A VPC peering connection has been successfully deleted. 
               

               

               **Spot instance events:**  

               

               
              * INSTANCE_INTERRUPTED -- A spot instance was interrupted by EC2 with a two-minute notification. 
               

               

               **Other fleet events:**  

               

               
              * FLEET_SCALING_EVENT -- A change was made to the fleet's capacity settings (desired instances, minimum/maximum scaling limits). Event messaging includes the new capacity settings. 
               
              * FLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED -- A change was made to the fleet's game session protection policy setting. Event messaging includes both the old and new policy setting.  
               
              * FLEET_DELETED -- A request to delete a fleet was initiated. 
               
              * GENERIC_EVENT -- An unspecified event has occurred.

              - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

                Provides additional information about game session status. ``INTERRUPTED`` indicates that the game session was hosted on a spot instance that was reclaimed, causing the active game session to be terminated.

                
              

              - **GameProperties** *(list) --* 

                A set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session. You can search for active game sessions based on this custom data with  SearchGameSessions .

                
                

                - *(dict) --*

              - **CreatorId** *(string) --* 

                A unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can create.

                
              

              - **GameSessionData** *(string) --* 

                A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session.

                
              

              - **MatchmakerData** *(string) --* 

                Information about the matchmaking process that was used to create the game session. It is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. In addition the matchmaking configuration used, it contains data on all players assigned to the match, including player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see `Match Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-server.html#match-server-data>`__ . Matchmaker data is useful when requesting match backfills, and is updated whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see  StartMatchBackfill ). 

                
              

              - **Location** *(string) --*

            - **ProtectionPolicy** *(string) --* 

              Current status of protection for the game session.

               

               
              * **NoProtection** -- The game session can be terminated during a scale-down event. 
               
              * **FullProtection** -- If the game session is in an ``ACTIVE`` status, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.

            - **Name** *(string) --* 

              A descriptive label that is associated with game session queue. Queue names must be unique within each Region.

              
            

            - **GameSessionQueueArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (`ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) that is assigned to a GameLift game session queue resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name>`` . In a GameLift game session queue ARN, the resource ID matches the *Name* value.

              
            

            - **TimeoutInSeconds** *(integer) --* 

              The maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement request remains in the queue. When a request exceeds this time, the game session placement changes to a ``TIMED_OUT`` status.

              
            

            - **PlayerLatencyPolicies** *(list) --* 

              A set of policies that act as a sliding cap on player latency. FleetIQ works to deliver low latency for most players in a game session. These policies ensure that no individual player can be placed into a game with unreasonably high latency. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency requirements a step at a time. Multiple policies are applied based on their maximum allowed latency, starting with the lowest value. 

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Sets a latency cap for individual players when placing a game session. With a latency policy in force, a game session cannot be placed in a fleet location where a player reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are used only with placement request that provide player latency information. Player latency policies can be stacked to gradually relax latency requirements over time. 

                 

                Latency policies are part of a  GameSessionQueue .

                
                

                - **MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds** *(integer) --* 

                  The maximum latency value that is allowed for any player, in milliseconds. All policies must have a value set for this property.

                  
                

                - **PolicyDurationSeconds** *(integer) --* 

                  The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. A null value for this property means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.

                  
            
          
            

            - **Destinations** *(list) --* 

              A list of fleets and/or fleet aliases that can be used to fulfill game session placement requests in the queue. Destinations are identified by either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias ARN, and are listed in order of placement preference.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A fleet or alias designated in a game session queue. Queues fulfill requests for new game sessions by placing a new game session on any of the queue's destinations. 

                 

                Destinations are part of a  GameSessionQueue .

                
                

                - **DestinationArn** *(string) --* 

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is assigned to fleet or fleet alias. ARNs, which include a fleet ID or alias ID and a Region name, provide a unique identifier across all Regions. 

                  
            
          
            

            - **FilterConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

              A list of locations where a queue is allowed to place new game sessions. Locations are specified in the form of AWS Region codes, such as ``us-west-2`` . If this parameter is not set, game sessions can be placed in any queue location. 

              
              

              - **AllowedLocations** *(list) --* 

                A list of locations to allow game session placement in, in the form of AWS Region codes such as ``us-west-2`` .

            - **PriorityConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

              Custom settings to use when prioritizing destinations and locations for game session placements. This configuration replaces the FleetIQ default prioritization process. Priority types that are not explicitly named will be automatically applied at the end of the prioritization process. 

              
              

              - **PriorityOrder** *(list) --* 

                The recommended sequence to use when prioritizing where to place new game sessions. Each type can only be listed once.

                 

                 
                * ``LATENCY`` -- FleetIQ prioritizes locations where the average player latency (provided in each game session request) is lowest.  
                 
                * ``COST`` -- FleetIQ prioritizes destinations with the lowest current hosting costs. Cost is evaluated based on the location, instance type, and fleet type (Spot or On-Demand) for each destination in the queue. 
                 
                * ``DESTINATION`` -- FleetIQ prioritizes based on the order that destinations are listed in the queue configuration. 
                 
                * ``LOCATION`` -- FleetIQ prioritizes based on the provided order of locations, as defined in ``LocationOrder`` .  
                 

                
                

                - *(string) --*

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents the returned data in response to a request operation.

        
        

        - **GameSessions** *(list) --* 

          A collection of properties for each game session that matches the request.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Properties describing a game session.

             

            A game session in ACTIVE status can host players. When a game session ends, its status is set to ``TERMINATED`` . 

             

            Once the session ends, the game session object is retained for 30 days. This means you can reuse idempotency token values after this time. Game session logs are retained for 14 days.

You can search for active game sessions based on this custom data with  SearchGameSessions .

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a game session. When included in a game session request, these properties communicate details to be used when setting up the new game session. For example, a game property might specify a game mode, level, or map. Game properties are passed to the game server process when initiating a new game session. For more information, see the `GameLift Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#gamelift-sdk-client-api-create>`__ .

        - **RuleSets** *(list) --* 

          A collection of requested matchmaking rule set objects. 

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Set of rule statements, used with FlexMatch, that determine how to build your player matches. Each rule set describes a type of group to be created and defines the parameters for acceptable player matches. Rule sets are used in  MatchmakingConfiguration objects.

             

            A rule set may define the following elements for a match. For detailed information and examples showing how to construct a rule set, see `Build a FlexMatch rule set <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-rulesets.html>`__ . 

             

             
            * Teams -- Required. A rule set must define one or multiple teams for the match and set minimum and maximum team sizes. For example, a rule set might describe a 4x4 match that requires all eight slots to be filled.  
             
            * Player attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set of player characteristics to evaluate when looking for a match. Matchmaking requests that use a rule set with player attributes must provide the corresponding attribute values. For example, an attribute might specify a player's skill or level. 
             
            * Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a match based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for individual players, teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might require each player to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least one player in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may describe an entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at least one player in a certain role.  
             
            * Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a period of time when no acceptable matches are found. This feature lets you balance getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of making them wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill variance between players after 30 seconds.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents the returned data in response to a request operation.

        
        

        - **PlayerSessions** *(list) --* 

          A collection of objects containing properties for each player session that matches the request.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Represents a player session. Player sessions are created either for a specific game session, or as part of a game session placement or matchmaking request. A player session can represents a reserved player slot in a game session (when status is ``RESERVED`` ) or actual player activity in a game session (when status is ``ACTIVE`` ). A player session object, including player data, is automatically passed to a game session when the player connects to the game session and is validated. After the game session ends, player sessions information is retained for 30 days and then removed.

              The Amazon Resource Name (`ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) that is assigned to a GameLift alias resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::alias/alias-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912`` . In a GameLift alias ARN, the resource ID matches the alias ID value.

              
            

            - **Description** *(string) --* 

              A human-readable description of an alias.

            - **InstanceDefinitions** *(list) --* 

              The set of EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ can use when balancing and automatically scaling instances in the corresponding Auto Scaling group. 

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                 **This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game server groups.**  

                 

                An allowed instance type for a  GameServerGroup . All game server groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of viable instance types.

                
                

                - **InstanceType** *(string) --* 

                  An EC2 instance type designation.

                  
                

                - **WeightedCapacity** *(string) --* 

                  Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effective options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see `Instance Weighting <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default value is "1".

                  
            
          
            

            - **BalancingStrategy** *(string) --* 

              Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:

               

               
              * ``SPOT_ONLY`` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced. 
               
              * ``SPOT_PREFERRED`` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances. 
               
              * ``ON_DEMAND_ONLY`` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force. 
               

              
            

            - **GameServerProtectionPolicy** *(string) --* 

              A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. 

              
            

            - **AutoScalingGroupArn** *(string) --* 

              A generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is associated with this game server group.

              
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              The current status of the game server group. Possible statuses include:

               

               
              * ``NEW`` - GameLift FleetIQ has validated the ``CreateGameServerGroup()`` request.  
               
              * ``ACTIVATING`` - GameLift FleetIQ is setting up a game server group, which includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account.  
               
              * ``ACTIVE`` - The game server group has been successfully created.  
               
              * ``DELETE_SCHEDULED`` - A request to delete the game server group has been received.  
               
              * ``DELETING`` - GameLift FleetIQ has received a valid ``DeleteGameServerGroup()`` request and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ must first complete and release hosts before it deletes the Auto Scaling group and the game server group.  
               
              * ``DELETED`` - The game server group has been successfully deleted.  
               
              * ``ERROR`` - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a game server group has failed, resulting in an error state. 
               

              
            

            - **StatusReason** *(string) --*

              Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was claimed with a  ClaimGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ). This value is used to calculate when a claimed game server's status should revert to null.

              
            

            - **LastHealthCheckTime** *(datetime) --* 

              Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was updated with health status using an  UpdateGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"`` ). After game server registration, this property is only changed when a game server update specifies a health check value.

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          FleetId='string',
          AliasId='string',
          Location='string',
          FilterExpression='string',
          SortExpression='string',
          PaginationConfig={
              'MaxItems': 123,
              'PageSize': 123,
              'StartingToken': 'string'
          }
      )
    :type FleetId: string
    :param FleetId: 

      A unique identifier for the fleet to search for active game sessions. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

      

    
    :type AliasId: string
    :param AliasId: 

      A unique identifier for the alias associated with the fleet to search for active game sessions. You can use either the alias ID or ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

      

    
    :type Location: string
    :param Location: 

      A fleet location to search for game sessions. You can specify a fleet's home Region or a remote location. Use the AWS Region code format, such as ``us-west-2`` . 

       

       

      

    
    :type FilterExpression: string
    :param FilterExpression: 

      String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in ``ACTIVE`` status.

       

      A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists of the following:

       

       
      * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are ``gameSessionName`` , ``gameSessionId`` , ``gameSessionProperties`` , ``maximumSessions`` , ``creationTimeMillis`` , ``playerSessionCount`` , ``hasAvailablePlayerSessions`` . 
       
      * **Comparator** -- Valid comparators are: ``=`` , ``<>`` , ``<`` , ``>`` , ``<=`` , ``>=`` .  
       
      * **Value** -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators ``=`` and ``<>`` . For example, the following filter expression searches on ``gameSessionName`` : "``FilterExpression": "gameSessionName = 'Matt\\'s Awesome Game 1'"`` .  
       

       

      To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords ``AND`` , ``OR`` , and ``NOT`` and parentheses as needed. For example: ``x AND y AND NOT z`` , ``NOT (x OR y)`` .

       

      Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:

       

       
      * ``=`` , ``<>`` , ``<`` , ``>`` , ``<=`` , ``>=``   
       
      * Parentheses 
       
      * NOT 
       
      * AND 
       
      * OR 
       

       

      For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: ``"maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true"`` . 

      

    
    :type SortExpression: string
    :param SortExpression: 

      Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression is included, the request returns results in random order. A sort expression consists of the following elements:

       

       
      * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are ``gameSessionName`` , ``gameSessionId`` , ``gameSessionProperties`` , ``maximumSessions`` , ``creationTimeMillis`` , ``playerSessionCount`` , ``hasAvailablePlayerSessions`` . 
       
      * **Order** -- Valid sort orders are ``ASC`` (ascending) and ``DESC`` (descending). 
       

       

      For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions first: ``"SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC"`` . Results with a null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

        

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents the returned data in response to a request operation.

        
        

        - **GameSessions** *(list) --* 

          A collection of objects containing game session properties for each session that matches the request.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Properties describing a game session.

             

            A game session in ACTIVE status can host players. When a game session ends, its status is set to ``TERMINATED`` . 

             

            Once the session ends, the game session object is retained for 30 days. This means you can reuse idempotency token values after this time. Game session logs are retained for 14 days.

            - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

              Provides additional information about game session status. ``INTERRUPTED`` indicates that the game session was hosted on a spot instance that was reclaimed, causing the active game session to be terminated.

              
            

            - **GameProperties** *(list) --* 

              A set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session. You can search for active game sessions based on this custom data with  SearchGameSessions .

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a game session. When included in a game session request, these properties communicate details to be used when setting up the new game session. For example, a game property might specify a game mode, level, or map. Game properties are passed to the game server process when initiating a new game session. For more information, see the `GameLift Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#gamelift-sdk-client-api-create>`__ .

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The game property identifier.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --*

            - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

              The IP address of the game session. To connect to a GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

              
            

            - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

              The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:

               

               
              * TLS-enabled fleets: ``<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com`` . 
               
              * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: ``ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com`` . (See `Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses>`__ .) 
               

               

              When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

              
            

            - **Port** *(integer) --* 

              The port number for the game session. To connect to a GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

              
            

            - **PlayerSessionCreationPolicy** *(string) --* 

              Indicates whether or not the game session is accepting new players.

              
            

            - **CreatorId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can create.

              
            

            - **GameSessionData** *(string) --* 

              A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session.

              
            

            - **MatchmakerData** *(string) --* 

              Information about the matchmaking process that was used to create the game session. It is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. In addition the matchmaking configuration used, it contains data on all players assigned to the match, including player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see `Match Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-server.html#match-server-data>`__ . Matchmaker data is useful when requesting match backfills, and is updated whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see  StartMatchBackfill ). 

              
            

            - **Location** *(string) --* 

              The fleet location where the game session is running. This value might specify the fleet's home Region or a remote location. Location is expressed as an AWS Region code such as ``us-west-2`` .
