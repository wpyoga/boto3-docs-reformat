.. py:class:: NetworkFirewall.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Network Firewall
  

  This is the API Reference for AWS Network Firewall. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Network Firewall API actions, data types, and errors. 

   

   
  * The REST API requires you to handle connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. For general information about using the AWS REST APIs, see `AWS APIs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html>`__ .  To access Network Firewall using the REST API endpoint: ``https://network-firewall.<region>.amazonaws.com``   
   
  * Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see `AWS SDKs <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs>`__ . 
   
  * For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and step-by-step instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall console, see the `Network Firewall Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/>`__ . 
   

   

  Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules that are compatible with Suricata, a free, open source intrusion detection system (IDS) engine. For information about Suricata, see the `Suricata website <https://suricata-ids.org/>`__ .

   

  You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of ways. The following are just a few examples: 

   

   
  * Allow domains or IP addresses for known AWS service endpoints, such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic. 
   
  * Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your applications can access. 
   
  * Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC. 
   
  * Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, regardless of the port used. 
   

   

  To enable Network Firewall for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in Network Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see `Amazon VPC User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/>`__ .

   

  To start using Network Firewall, do the following: 

   

   
  * (Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to protect, create it in Amazon VPC.  
   
  * In Amazon VPC, in each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall endpoint, create a subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall.  
   
  * In Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define the components of the network traffic filtering behavior that you want your firewall to have.  
   
  * In Network Firewall, create a firewall policy that uses your rule groups and specifies additional default traffic filtering behavior.  
   
  * In Network Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy and VPC subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet that you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy. 
   
  * In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route traffic through the new firewall endpoints.

  .. py:method:: associate_firewall_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Associates a  FirewallPolicy to a  Firewall . 

     

    A firewall policy defines how to monitor and manage your VPC network traffic, using a collection of inspection rule groups and other settings. Each firewall requires one firewall policy association, and you can use the same firewall policy for multiple firewalls.

  .. py:method:: associate_subnets(**kwargs)

    

    Associates the specified subnets in the Amazon VPC to the firewall. You can specify one subnet for each of the Availability Zones that the VPC spans. 

     

    This request creates an AWS Network Firewall firewall endpoint in each of the subnets. To enable the firewall's protections, you must also modify the VPC's route tables for each subnet's Availability Zone, to redirect the traffic that's coming into and going out of the zone through the firewall endpoint.

        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: create_firewall(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an AWS Network Firewall  Firewall and accompanying  FirewallStatus for a VPC. 

     

    The firewall defines the configuration settings for an AWS Network Firewall firewall. The settings that you can define at creation include the firewall policy, the subnets in your VPC to use for the firewall endpoints, and any tags that are attached to the firewall AWS resource. 

     

    After you create a firewall, you can provide additional settings, like the logging configuration. 

     

    To update the settings for a firewall, you use the operations that apply to the settings themselves, for example  UpdateLoggingConfiguration ,  AssociateSubnets , and  UpdateFirewallDeleteProtection . 

     

    To manage a firewall's tags, use the standard AWS resource tagging operations,  ListTagsForResource ,  TagResource , and  UntagResource .

     

    To retrieve information about firewalls, use  ListFirewalls and  DescribeFirewall .

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **Firewall** *(dict) --* 

          The configuration settings for the firewall. These settings include the firewall policy and the subnets in your VPC to use for the firewall endpoints. 

          
          

          - **FirewallName** *(string) --* 

            The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a firewall after you create it.

            
          

          - **FirewallArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

            
          

          - **FirewallPolicyArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

             

            The relationship of firewall to firewall policy is many to one. Each firewall requires one firewall policy association, and you can use the same firewall policy for multiple firewalls. 

            
          

          - **VpcId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier of the VPC where the firewall is in use. 

            
          

          - **SubnetMappings** *(list) --* 

            The public subnets that Network Firewall is using for the firewall. Each subnet must belong to a different Availability Zone. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              The ID for a subnet that you want to associate with the firewall. This is used with  CreateFirewall and  AssociateSubnets . AWS Network Firewall creates an instance of the associated firewall in each subnet that you specify, to filter traffic in the subnet's Availability Zone.

              
              

              - **SubnetId** *(string) --* 

                The unique identifier for the subnet. 

                
          
        
          

          - **DeleteProtection** *(boolean) --* 

            A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall. A setting of ``TRUE`` indicates that the firewall is protected against deletion. Use this setting to protect against accidentally deleting a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this flag to ``TRUE`` .

            
          

          - **SubnetChangeProtection** *(boolean) --* 

            A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against changes to the subnet associations. Use this setting to protect against accidentally modifying the subnet associations for a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting to ``TRUE`` .

            
          

          - **FirewallPolicyChangeProtection** *(boolean) --* 

            A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against a change to the firewall policy association. Use this setting to protect against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting to ``TRUE`` .

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            A description of the firewall.

            
          

          - **FirewallId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the firewall. 

            
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A key:value pair associated with an AWS resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource. 

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a category, such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensitive.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **FirewallStatus** *(dict) --* 

          Detailed information about the current status of a  Firewall . You can retrieve this for a firewall by calling  DescribeFirewall and providing the firewall name and ARN.

          
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The readiness of the configured firewall to handle network traffic across all of the Availability Zones where you've configured it. This setting is ``READY`` only when the ``ConfigurationSyncStateSummary`` value is ``IN_SYNC`` and the ``Attachment``  ``Status`` values for all of the configured subnets are ``READY`` . 

            
          

          - **ConfigurationSyncStateSummary** *(string) --* 

            The configuration sync state for the firewall. This summarizes the sync states reported in the ``Config`` settings for all of the Availability Zones where you have configured the firewall. 

             

            When you create a firewall or update its configuration, for example by adding a rule group to its firewall policy, Network Firewall distributes the configuration changes to all zones where the firewall is in use. This summary indicates whether the configuration changes have been applied everywhere. 

             

            This status must be ``IN_SYNC`` for the firewall to be ready for use, but it doesn't indicate that the firewall is ready. The ``Status`` setting indicates firewall readiness.

            
          

          - **SyncStates** *(dict) --* 

            The subnets that you've configured for use by the Network Firewall firewall. This contains one array element per Availability Zone where you've configured a subnet. These objects provide details of the information that is summarized in the ``ConfigurationSyncStateSummary`` and ``Status`` , broken down by zone and configuration object. 

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                The status of the firewall endpoint and firewall policy configuration for a single VPC subnet. 

                 

                For each VPC subnet that you associate with a firewall, AWS Network Firewall does the following: 

                 

                 
                * Instantiates a firewall endpoint in the subnet, ready to take traffic. 
                 
                * Configures the endpoint with the current firewall policy settings, to provide the filtering behavior for the endpoint. 
                 

                 

                When you update a firewall, for example to add a subnet association or change a rule group in the firewall policy, the affected sync states reflect out-of-sync or not ready status until the changes are complete. 

                
                

                - **Attachment** *(dict) --* 

                  The attachment status of the firewall's association with a single VPC subnet. For each configured subnet, Network Firewall creates the attachment by instantiating the firewall endpoint in the subnet so that it's ready to take traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .

                  
                  

                  - **SubnetId** *(string) --* 

                    The unique identifier of the subnet that you've specified to be used for a firewall endpoint. 

                    
                  

                  - **EndpointId** *(string) --* 

                    The identifier of the firewall endpoint that Network Firewall has instantiated in the subnet. You use this to identify the firewall endpoint in the VPC route tables, when you redirect the VPC traffic through the endpoint. 

                    
                  

                  - **Status** *(string) --* 

                    The current status of the firewall endpoint in the subnet. This value reflects both the instantiation of the endpoint in the VPC subnet and the sync states that are reported in the ``Config`` settings. When this value is ``READY`` , the endpoint is available and configured properly to handle network traffic. When the endpoint isn't available for traffic, this value will reflect its state, for example ``CREATING`` , ``DELETING`` , or ``FAILED`` .

                    
              
                

                - **Config** *(dict) --* 

                  The configuration status of the firewall endpoint in a single VPC subnet. Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the rules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
                    

                    - *(dict) --* 

                      Provides configuration status for a single policy or rule group that is used for a firewall endpoint. Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the rules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is part of a  SyncState for a firewall.

                      
                      

                      - **SyncStatus** *(string) --* 

                        Indicates whether this object is in sync with the version indicated in the update token.

                        
                      

                      - **UpdateToken** *(string) --* 

                        The current version of the object that is either in sync or pending synchronization.

      The descriptive name of the firewall policy. You can't change the name of a firewall policy after you create it.

      

    
    :type FirewallPolicy: dict
    :param FirewallPolicy: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The rule groups and policy actions to use in the firewall policy.

      

    
      - **StatelessRuleGroupReferences** *(list) --* 

        References to the stateless rule groups that are used in the policy. These define the matching criteria in stateless rules. 

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Identifier for a single stateless rule group, used in a firewall policy to refer to the rule group. 

          

        
          - **ResourceArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stateless rule group.

            

          
          - **Priority** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            An integer setting that indicates the order in which to run the stateless rule groups in a single  FirewallPolicy . Network Firewall applies each stateless rule group to a packet starting with the group that has the lowest priority setting. You must ensure that the priority settings are unique within each policy.

            

          
        
    
      - **StatelessDefaultActions** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The actions to take on a packet if it doesn't match any of the stateless rules in the policy. If you want non-matching packets to be forwarded for stateful inspection, specify ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` . 

         

        You must specify one of the standard actions: ``aws:pass`` , ``aws:drop`` , or ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` . In addition, you can specify custom actions that are compatible with your standard section choice.

         

        For example, you could specify ``["aws:pass"]`` or you could specify ``["aws:pass", “customActionName”]`` . For information about compatibility, see the custom action descriptions under  CustomAction .

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **StatelessFragmentDefaultActions** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The actions to take on a fragmented UDP packet if it doesn't match any of the stateless rules in the policy. Network Firewall only manages UDP packet fragments and silently drops packet fragments for other protocols. If you want non-matching fragmented UDP packets to be forwarded for stateful inspection, specify ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` . 

         

        You must specify one of the standard actions: ``aws:pass`` , ``aws:drop`` , or ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` . In addition, you can specify custom actions that are compatible with your standard section choice.

         

        For example, you could specify ``["aws:pass"]`` or you could specify ``["aws:pass", “customActionName”]`` . For information about compatibility, see the custom action descriptions under  CustomAction .

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **StatelessCustomActions** *(list) --* 

        The custom action definitions that are available for use in the firewall policy's ``StatelessDefaultActions`` setting. You name each custom action that you define, and then you can use it by name in your default actions specifications.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          An optional, non-standard action to use for stateless packet handling. You can define this in addition to the standard action that you must specify. 

           

          You define and name the custom actions that you want to be able to use, and then you reference them by name in your actions settings. 

           

          You can use custom actions in the following places: 

           

           
          * In a rule group's  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specification. The custom actions are available for use by name inside the ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` where you define them. You can use them for your stateless rule actions to specify what to do with a packet that matches the rule's match attributes.  
           
          * In a  FirewallPolicy specification, in ``StatelessCustomActions`` . The custom actions are available for use inside the policy where you define them. You can use them for the policy's default stateless actions settings to specify what to do with packets that don't match any of the policy's stateless rules.  
           

          

        
          - **ActionName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The descriptive name of the custom action. You can't change the name of a custom action after you create it.

            

          
          - **ActionDefinition** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The custom action associated with the action name.

            

          
            - **PublishMetricAction** *(dict) --* 

              Stateless inspection criteria that publishes the specified metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for the matching packet. This setting defines a CloudWatch dimension value to be published.

               

              You can pair this custom action with any of the standard stateless rule actions. For example, you could pair this in a rule action with the standard action that forwards the packet for stateful inspection. Then, when a packet matches the rule, Network Firewall publishes metrics for the packet and forwards it. 

              

            
              - **Dimensions** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                

                

              
                - *(dict) --* 

                  The value to use in an Amazon CloudWatch custom metric dimension. This is used in the ``PublishMetrics``   CustomAction . A CloudWatch custom metric dimension is a name/value pair that's part of the identity of a metric. 

                   

                  AWS Network Firewall sets the dimension name to ``CustomAction`` and you provide the dimension value. 

                   

                  For more information about CloudWatch custom metric dimensions, see `Publishing Custom Metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#usingDimensions>`__ in the `Amazon CloudWatch User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html>`__ .

                  

                
                  - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The value to use in the custom metric dimension.

        References to the stateless rule groups that are used in the policy. These define the inspection criteria in stateful rules. 

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Identifier for a single stateful rule group, used in a firewall policy to refer to a rule group. 

          

        
          - **ResourceArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stateful rule group.

            

          
        
    
    
    :type Description: string
    :param Description: 

      A description of the firewall policy.

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A key:value pair associated with an AWS resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource. 

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a category, such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensitive.

          

        
      
  
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the validity of the request, rather than run the request. 

       

      If set to ``TRUE`` , Network Firewall checks whether the request can run successfully, but doesn't actually make the requested changes. The call returns the value that the request would return if you ran it with dry run set to ``FALSE`` , but doesn't make additions or changes to your resources. This option allows you to make sure that you have the required permissions to run the request and that your request parameters are valid. 

       

      If set to ``FALSE`` , Network Firewall makes the requested changes to your resources.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **UpdateToken** *(string) --* 

          A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall policy. The token marks the state of the policy resource at the time of the request. 

           

          To make changes to the policy, you provide the token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the policy hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an ``InvalidTokenException`` . If this happens, retrieve the firewall policy again to get a current copy of it with current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token. 

          
        

        - **FirewallPolicyResponse** *(dict) --* 

          The high-level properties of a firewall policy. This, along with the  FirewallPolicy , define the policy. You can retrieve all objects for a firewall policy by calling  DescribeFirewallPolicy . 

          
          

          - **FirewallPolicyName** *(string) --* 

            The descriptive name of the firewall policy. You can't change the name of a firewall policy after you create it.

            - **Action** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              Defines what Network Firewall should do with the packets in a traffic flow when the flow matches the stateful rule criteria. For all actions, Network Firewall performs the specified action and discontinues stateful inspection of the traffic flow. 

               

              The actions for a stateful rule are defined as follows: 

               

               
              * **PASS** - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination. 
               
              * **DROP** - Blocks the packets from going to the intended destination and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the  Firewall   LoggingConfiguration .  
               
              * **ALERT** - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the  Firewall   LoggingConfiguration .  You can use this action to test a rule that you intend to use to drop traffic. You can enable the rule with ``ALERT`` action, verify in the logs that the rule is filtering as you want, then change the action to ``DROP`` . 
               

              

            
            - **Header** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                        * The ones that are not set in this flags setting must also not be set in the packet.  
                         

                        

                      
                        - *(string) --* 

                        
                    
                      - **Masks** *(list) --* 

                        The set of flags to consider in the inspection. To inspect all flags in the valid values list, leave this with no setting.

                        

                      
                        - *(string) --* 

                        
                    
                    
                
                
                - **Actions** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The actions to take on a packet that matches one of the stateless rule definition's match attributes. You must specify a standard action and you can add custom actions. 

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Network Firewall only forwards a packet for stateful rule inspection if you specify ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` for a rule that the packet matches, or if the packet doesn't match any stateless rule and you specify ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` for the ``StatelessDefaultActions`` setting for the  FirewallPolicy .

                     

                   

                  For every rule, you must specify exactly one of the following standard actions. 

                   

                   
                  * **aws:pass** - Discontinues all inspection of the packet and permits it to go to its intended destination. 
                   
                  * **aws:drop** - Discontinues all inspection of the packet and blocks it from going to its intended destination. 
                   
                  * **aws:forward_to_sfe** - Discontinues stateless inspection of the packet and forwards it to the stateful rule engine for inspection.  
                   

                   

                  Additionally, you can specify a custom action. To do this, you define a custom action by name and type, then provide the name you've assigned to the action in this ``Actions`` setting. For information about the options, see  CustomAction . 

                   

                  To provide more than one action in this setting, separate the settings with a comma. For example, if you have a custom ``PublishMetrics`` action that you've named ``MyMetricsAction`` , then you could specify the standard action ``aws:pass`` and the custom action with ``[“aws:pass”, “MyMetricsAction”]`` . 

                  

                
                  - *(string) --* 

                  
              
              
              - **Priority** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                A setting that indicates the order in which to run this rule relative to all of the rules that are defined for a stateless rule group. Network Firewall evaluates the rules in a rule group starting with the lowest priority setting. You must ensure that the priority settings are unique for the rule group. 

                 

                Each stateless rule group uses exactly one ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` object, and each ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` contains exactly one ``StatelessRules`` object. To ensure unique priority settings for your rule groups, set unique priorities for the stateless rules that you define inside any single ``StatelessRules`` object.

                 

                You can change the priority settings of your rules at any time. To make it easier to insert rules later, number them so there's a wide range in between, for example use 100, 200, and so on. 

                

              
            
        
          - **CustomActions** *(list) --* 

            Defines an array of individual custom action definitions that are available for use by the stateless rules in this ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` specification. You name each custom action that you define, and then you can use it by name in your  StatelessRule   RuleDefinition  ``Actions`` specification.

            

          
            - *(dict) --* 

              An optional, non-standard action to use for stateless packet handling. You can define this in addition to the standard action that you must specify. 

               

              You define and name the custom actions that you want to be able to use, and then you reference them by name in your actions settings. 

               

              You can use custom actions in the following places: 

               

               
              * In a rule group's  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specification. The custom actions are available for use by name inside the ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` where you define them. You can use them for your stateless rule actions to specify what to do with a packet that matches the rule's match attributes.  
               
              * In a  FirewallPolicy specification, in ``StatelessCustomActions`` . The custom actions are available for use inside the policy where you define them. You can use them for the policy's default stateless actions settings to specify what to do with packets that don't match any of the policy's stateless rules.  
               

              

            
              - **ActionName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The descriptive name of the custom action. You can't change the name of a custom action after you create it.

                

              
              - **ActionDefinition** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The custom action associated with the action name.

                

              
                - **PublishMetricAction** *(dict) --* 

                  Stateless inspection criteria that publishes the specified metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for the matching packet. This setting defines a CloudWatch dimension value to be published.

                   

                  You can pair this custom action with any of the standard stateless rule actions. For example, you could pair this in a rule action with the standard action that forwards the packet for stateful inspection. Then, when a packet matches the rule, Network Firewall publishes metrics for the packet and forwards it. 

                  

                
                  - **Dimensions** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    

                    

                  
                    - *(dict) --* 

                      The value to use in an Amazon CloudWatch custom metric dimension. This is used in the ``PublishMetrics``   CustomAction . A CloudWatch custom metric dimension is a name/value pair that's part of the identity of a metric. 

                       

                      AWS Network Firewall sets the dimension name to ``CustomAction`` and you provide the dimension value. 

                       

                      For more information about CloudWatch custom metric dimensions, see `Publishing Custom Metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#usingDimensions>`__ in the `Amazon CloudWatch User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html>`__ .

                      

                    
                      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                        The value to use in the custom metric dimension.

                        

                      
                    
                
                
              
            
        
        
      
    
    :type Rules: string
    :param Rules: 

      A string containing stateful rule group rules specifications in Suricata flat format, with one rule per line. Use this to import your existing Suricata compatible rule groups. 

       

      .. note::

         

        You must provide either this rules setting or a populated ``RuleGroup`` setting, but not both. 

         

       

      You can provide your rule group specification in Suricata flat format through this setting when you create or update your rule group. The call response returns a  RuleGroup object that Network Firewall has populated from your string. 

      

    
    :type Type: string
    :param Type: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it contains stateful rules. 

      

    
    :type Description: string
    :param Description: 

      A description of the rule group. 

      

    
    :type Capacity: integer
    :param Capacity: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The maximum operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group, you are limited to this capacity. When you reference a rule group from a firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves this capacity for the rule group. 

       

      You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule group before you create the rule group by calling  CreateRuleGroup with ``DryRun`` set to ``TRUE`` . 

       

      .. note::

         

        You can't change or exceed this capacity when you update the rule group, so leave room for your rule group to grow. 

         

       

       **Capacity for a stateless rule group**  

       

      For a stateless rule group, the capacity required is the sum of the capacity requirements of the individual rules that you expect to have in the rule group. 

       

      To calculate the capacity requirement of a single rule, multiply the capacity requirement values of each of the rule's match settings:

       

       
      * A match setting with no criteria specified has a value of 1.  
       
      * A match setting with ``Any`` specified has a value of 1.  
       
      * All other match settings have a value equal to the number of elements provided in the setting. For example, a protocol setting ["UDP"] and a source setting ["10.0.0.0/24"] each have a value of 1. A protocol setting ["UDP","TCP"] has a value of 2. A source setting ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"] has a value of 3.  
       

       

      A rule with no criteria specified in any of its match settings has a capacity requirement of 1. A rule with protocol setting ["UDP","TCP"], source setting ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"], and a single specification or no specification for each of the other match settings has a capacity requirement of 6. 

       

       **Capacity for a stateful rule group**  

       

      For a stateful rule group, the minimum capacity required is the number of individual rules that you expect to have in the rule group. 

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A key:value pair associated with an AWS resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource. 

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a category, such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensitive.

          

        
      
  
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the validity of the request, rather than run the request. 

       

      If set to ``TRUE`` , Network Firewall checks whether the request can run successfully, but doesn't actually make the requested changes. The call returns the value that the request would return if you ran it with dry run set to ``FALSE`` , but doesn't make additions or changes to your resources. This option allows you to make sure that you have the required permissions to run the request and that your request parameters are valid. 

       

      If set to ``FALSE`` , Network Firewall makes the requested changes to your resources.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **UpdateToken** *(string) --* 

          A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the rule group. The token marks the state of the rule group resource at the time of the request. 

           

          To make changes to the rule group, you provide the token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the rule group hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an ``InvalidTokenException`` . If this happens, retrieve the rule group again to get a current copy of it with a current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token. 

          
        

        - **RuleGroupResponse** *(dict) --* 

          The high-level properties of a rule group. This, along with the  RuleGroup , define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects for a rule group by calling  DescribeRuleGroup .

  .. py:method:: delete_firewall(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the specified  Firewall and its  FirewallStatus . This operation requires the firewall's ``DeleteProtection`` flag to be ``FALSE`` . You can't revert this operation. 

     

    You can check whether a firewall is in use by reviewing the route tables for the Availability Zones where you have firewall subnet mappings. Retrieve the subnet mappings by calling  DescribeFirewall . You define and update the route tables through Amazon VPC. As needed, update the route tables for the zones to remove the firewall endpoints. When the route tables no longer use the firewall endpoints, you can remove the firewall safely.

     

    To delete a firewall, remove the delete protection if you need to using  UpdateFirewallDeleteProtection , then delete the firewall by calling  DeleteFirewall .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **Firewall** *(dict) --* 

          The firewall defines the configuration settings for an AWS Network Firewall firewall. These settings include the firewall policy, the subnets in your VPC to use for the firewall endpoints, and any tags that are attached to the firewall AWS resource. 

           

          The status of the firewall, for example whether it's ready to filter network traffic, is provided in the corresponding  FirewallStatus . You can retrieve both objects by calling  DescribeFirewall .

          
          

          - **FirewallName** *(string) --* 

            The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a firewall after you create it.

            
          

          - **FirewallArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

            
          

          - **FirewallPolicyArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

             

            The relationship of firewall to firewall policy is many to one. Each firewall requires one firewall policy association, and you can use the same firewall policy for multiple firewalls. 

            
          

          - **VpcId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier of the VPC where the firewall is in use. 

            
          

          - **SubnetMappings** *(list) --* 

            The public subnets that Network Firewall is using for the firewall. Each subnet must belong to a different Availability Zone. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              The ID for a subnet that you want to associate with the firewall. This is used with  CreateFirewall and  AssociateSubnets . AWS Network Firewall creates an instance of the associated firewall in each subnet that you specify, to filter traffic in the subnet's Availability Zone.

              
              

              - **SubnetId** *(string) --* 

                The unique identifier for the subnet. 

                
          
        
          

          - **DeleteProtection** *(boolean) --* 

            A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall. A setting of ``TRUE`` indicates that the firewall is protected against deletion. Use this setting to protect against accidentally deleting a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this flag to ``TRUE`` .

            
          

          - **SubnetChangeProtection** *(boolean) --* 

            A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against changes to the subnet associations. Use this setting to protect against accidentally modifying the subnet associations for a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting to ``TRUE`` .

            
          

          - **FirewallPolicyChangeProtection** *(boolean) --* 

            A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against a change to the firewall policy association. Use this setting to protect against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting to ``TRUE`` .

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            A description of the firewall.

            
          

          - **FirewallId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the firewall. 

            
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A key:value pair associated with an AWS resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource. 

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a category, such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensitive.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **FirewallStatus** *(dict) --* 

          Detailed information about the current status of a  Firewall . You can retrieve this for a firewall by calling  DescribeFirewall and providing the firewall name and ARN.

          
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The readiness of the configured firewall to handle network traffic across all of the Availability Zones where you've configured it. This setting is ``READY`` only when the ``ConfigurationSyncStateSummary`` value is ``IN_SYNC`` and the ``Attachment``  ``Status`` values for all of the configured subnets are ``READY`` . 

            
          

          - **ConfigurationSyncStateSummary** *(string) --* 

            The configuration sync state for the firewall. This summarizes the sync states reported in the ``Config`` settings for all of the Availability Zones where you have configured the firewall. 

             

            When you create a firewall or update its configuration, for example by adding a rule group to its firewall policy, Network Firewall distributes the configuration changes to all zones where the firewall is in use. This summary indicates whether the configuration changes have been applied everywhere. 

             

            This status must be ``IN_SYNC`` for the firewall to be ready for use, but it doesn't indicate that the firewall is ready. The ``Status`` setting indicates firewall readiness.

            
          

          - **SyncStates** *(dict) --* 

            The subnets that you've configured for use by the Network Firewall firewall. This contains one array element per Availability Zone where you've configured a subnet. These objects provide details of the information that is summarized in the ``ConfigurationSyncStateSummary`` and ``Status`` , broken down by zone and configuration object. 

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                The status of the firewall endpoint and firewall policy configuration for a single VPC subnet. 

                 

                For each VPC subnet that you associate with a firewall, AWS Network Firewall does the following: 

                 

                 
                * Instantiates a firewall endpoint in the subnet, ready to take traffic. 
                 
                * Configures the endpoint with the current firewall policy settings, to provide the filtering behavior for the endpoint. 
                 

                 

                When you update a firewall, for example to add a subnet association or change a rule group in the firewall policy, the affected sync states reflect out-of-sync or not ready status until the changes are complete. 

                
                

                - **Attachment** *(dict) --* 

                  The attachment status of the firewall's association with a single VPC subnet. For each configured subnet, Network Firewall creates the attachment by instantiating the firewall endpoint in the subnet so that it's ready to take traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .

                  
                  

                  - **SubnetId** *(string) --* 

                    The unique identifier of the subnet that you've specified to be used for a firewall endpoint. 

                    
                  

                  - **EndpointId** *(string) --* 

                    The identifier of the firewall endpoint that Network Firewall has instantiated in the subnet. You use this to identify the firewall endpoint in the VPC route tables, when you redirect the VPC traffic through the endpoint. 

                    
                  

                  - **Status** *(string) --* 

                    The current status of the firewall endpoint in the subnet. This value reflects both the instantiation of the endpoint in the VPC subnet and the sync states that are reported in the ``Config`` settings. When this value is ``READY`` , the endpoint is available and configured properly to handle network traffic. When the endpoint isn't available for traffic, this value will reflect its state, for example ``CREATING`` , ``DELETING`` , or ``FAILED`` .

                    
              
                

                - **Config** *(dict) --* 

                  The configuration status of the firewall endpoint in a single VPC subnet. Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the rules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
                    

                    - *(dict) --* 

                      Provides configuration status for a single policy or rule group that is used for a firewall endpoint. Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the rules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is part of a  SyncState for a firewall.

                      
                      

                      - **SyncStatus** *(string) --* 

                        Indicates whether this object is in sync with the version indicated in the update token.

                        
                      

                      - **UpdateToken** *(string) --* 

                        The current version of the object that is either in sync or pending synchronization.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **RuleGroupResponse** *(dict) --* 

          The high-level properties of a rule group. This, along with the  RuleGroup , define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects for a rule group by calling  DescribeRuleGroup . 

          
          

          - **RuleGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

             

            .. note::

               

              If this response is for a create request that had ``DryRun`` set to ``TRUE`` , then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't attached to a valid resource.

               

            
          

          - **RuleGroupName** *(string) --* 

            The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a rule group after you create it.

            
          

          - **RuleGroupId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the rule group. 

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            A description of the rule group. 

            
          

          - **Type** *(string) --* 

            Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it contains stateful rules. 

            
          

          - **Capacity** *(integer) --* 

            The maximum operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group, you are limited to this capacity. When you reference a rule group from a firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves this capacity for the rule group. 

             

            You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule group before you create the rule group by calling  CreateRuleGroup with ``DryRun`` set to ``TRUE`` . 

            
          

          - **RuleGroupStatus** *(string) --* 

            Detailed information about the current status of a rule group. 

            
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A key:value pair associated with an AWS resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource. 

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a category, such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensitive.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **UpdateToken** *(string) --* 

          An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall. The token marks the state of the firewall resource at the time of the request. 

           

          To make an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in your update request. Without the token, Network Firewall performs your updates regardless of whether the firewall has changed since you last retrieved it.

           

          To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an ``InvalidTokenException`` . If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy of it with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token. 

          
        

        - **Firewall** *(dict) --* 

          The configuration settings for the firewall. These settings include the firewall policy and the subnets in your VPC to use for the firewall endpoints. 

          
          

          - **FirewallName** *(string) --* 

            The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a firewall after you create it.

            
          

          - **FirewallArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

            
          

          - **FirewallPolicyArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

             

            The relationship of firewall to firewall policy is many to one. Each firewall requires one firewall policy association, and you can use the same firewall policy for multiple firewalls. 

            
          

          - **VpcId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier of the VPC where the firewall is in use. 

            
          

          - **SubnetMappings** *(list) --* 

            The public subnets that Network Firewall is using for the firewall. Each subnet must belong to a different Availability Zone. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              The ID for a subnet that you want to associate with the firewall. This is used with  CreateFirewall and  AssociateSubnets . AWS Network Firewall creates an instance of the associated firewall in each subnet that you specify, to filter traffic in the subnet's Availability Zone.

              
              

              - **SubnetId** *(string) --* 

                The unique identifier for the subnet. 

                
          
        
          

          - **DeleteProtection** *(boolean) --* 

            A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall. A setting of ``TRUE`` indicates that the firewall is protected against deletion. Use this setting to protect against accidentally deleting a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this flag to ``TRUE`` .

            
          

          - **SubnetChangeProtection** *(boolean) --* 

            A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against changes to the subnet associations. Use this setting to protect against accidentally modifying the subnet associations for a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting to ``TRUE`` .

            
          

          - **FirewallPolicyChangeProtection** *(boolean) --* 

            A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against a change to the firewall policy association. Use this setting to protect against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting to ``TRUE`` .

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            A description of the firewall.

            
          

          - **FirewallId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the firewall. 

            
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A key:value pair associated with an AWS resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource. 

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a category, such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensitive.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **FirewallStatus** *(dict) --* 

          Detailed information about the current status of a  Firewall . You can retrieve this for a firewall by calling  DescribeFirewall and providing the firewall name and ARN.

          
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The readiness of the configured firewall to handle network traffic across all of the Availability Zones where you've configured it. This setting is ``READY`` only when the ``ConfigurationSyncStateSummary`` value is ``IN_SYNC`` and the ``Attachment``  ``Status`` values for all of the configured subnets are ``READY`` . 

            
          

          - **ConfigurationSyncStateSummary** *(string) --* 

            The configuration sync state for the firewall. This summarizes the sync states reported in the ``Config`` settings for all of the Availability Zones where you have configured the firewall. 

             

            When you create a firewall or update its configuration, for example by adding a rule group to its firewall policy, Network Firewall distributes the configuration changes to all zones where the firewall is in use. This summary indicates whether the configuration changes have been applied everywhere. 

             

            This status must be ``IN_SYNC`` for the firewall to be ready for use, but it doesn't indicate that the firewall is ready. The ``Status`` setting indicates firewall readiness.

            
          

          - **SyncStates** *(dict) --* 

            The subnets that you've configured for use by the Network Firewall firewall. This contains one array element per Availability Zone where you've configured a subnet. These objects provide details of the information that is summarized in the ``ConfigurationSyncStateSummary`` and ``Status`` , broken down by zone and configuration object. 

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                The status of the firewall endpoint and firewall policy configuration for a single VPC subnet. 

                 

                For each VPC subnet that you associate with a firewall, AWS Network Firewall does the following: 

                 

                 
                * Instantiates a firewall endpoint in the subnet, ready to take traffic. 
                 
                * Configures the endpoint with the current firewall policy settings, to provide the filtering behavior for the endpoint. 
                 

                 

                When you update a firewall, for example to add a subnet association or change a rule group in the firewall policy, the affected sync states reflect out-of-sync or not ready status until the changes are complete. 

                
                

                - **Attachment** *(dict) --* 

                  The attachment status of the firewall's association with a single VPC subnet. For each configured subnet, Network Firewall creates the attachment by instantiating the firewall endpoint in the subnet so that it's ready to take traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .

                  
                  

                  - **SubnetId** *(string) --* 

                    The unique identifier of the subnet that you've specified to be used for a firewall endpoint. 

                    
                  

                  - **EndpointId** *(string) --* 

                    The identifier of the firewall endpoint that Network Firewall has instantiated in the subnet. You use this to identify the firewall endpoint in the VPC route tables, when you redirect the VPC traffic through the endpoint. 

                    
                  

                  - **Status** *(string) --* 

                    The current status of the firewall endpoint in the subnet. This value reflects both the instantiation of the endpoint in the VPC subnet and the sync states that are reported in the ``Config`` settings. When this value is ``READY`` , the endpoint is available and configured properly to handle network traffic. When the endpoint isn't available for traffic, this value will reflect its state, for example ``CREATING`` , ``DELETING`` , or ``FAILED`` .

                    
              
                

                - **Config** *(dict) --* 

                  The configuration status of the firewall endpoint in a single VPC subnet. Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the rules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
                    

                    - *(dict) --* 

                      Provides configuration status for a single policy or rule group that is used for a firewall endpoint. Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the rules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is part of a  SyncState for a firewall.

                      
                      

                      - **SyncStatus** *(string) --* 

                        Indicates whether this object is in sync with the version indicated in the update token.

                        
                      

                      - **UpdateToken** *(string) --* 

                        The current version of the object that is either in sync or pending synchronization.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **UpdateToken** *(string) --* 

          A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall policy. The token marks the state of the policy resource at the time of the request. 

           

          To make changes to the policy, you provide the token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the policy hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an ``InvalidTokenException`` . If this happens, retrieve the firewall policy again to get a current copy of it with current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token. 

          
        

        - **FirewallPolicyResponse** *(dict) --* 

          The high-level properties of a firewall policy. This, along with the  FirewallPolicy , define the policy. You can retrieve all objects for a firewall policy by calling  DescribeFirewallPolicy . 

          
          

          - **FirewallPolicyName** *(string) --* 

            The descriptive name of the firewall policy. You can't change the name of a firewall policy after you create it.

            
          

          - **FirewallPolicyArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

             

            .. note::

               

              If this response is for a create request that had ``DryRun`` set to ``TRUE`` , then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't attached to a valid resource.

               

            
          

          - **FirewallPolicyId** *(string) --*

            A description of the firewall policy.

            
          

          - **FirewallPolicyStatus** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the firewall policy. You can retrieve this for a firewall policy by calling  DescribeFirewallPolicy and providing the firewall policy's name or ARN.

            
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A key:value pair associated with an AWS resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource. 

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a category, such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensitive.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **FirewallPolicy** *(dict) --* 

          The policy for the specified firewall policy. 

          
          

          - **StatelessRuleGroupReferences** *(list) --* 

            References to the stateless rule groups that are used in the policy. These define the matching criteria in stateless rules. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Identifier for a single stateless rule group, used in a firewall policy to refer to the rule group. 

              
              

              - **ResourceArn** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stateless rule group.

                
              

              - **Priority** *(integer) --* 

                An integer setting that indicates the order in which to run the stateless rule groups in a single  FirewallPolicy . Network Firewall applies each stateless rule group to a packet starting with the group that has the lowest priority setting. You must ensure that the priority settings are unique within each policy.

                
          
        
          

          - **StatelessDefaultActions** *(list) --* 

            The actions to take on a packet if it doesn't match any of the stateless rules in the policy. If you want non-matching packets to be forwarded for stateful inspection, specify ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` . 

             

            You must specify one of the standard actions: ``aws:pass`` , ``aws:drop`` , or ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` . In addition, you can specify custom actions that are compatible with your standard section choice.

             

            For example, you could specify ``["aws:pass"]`` or you could specify ``["aws:pass", “customActionName”]`` . For information about compatibility, see the custom action descriptions under  CustomAction .

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **StatelessFragmentDefaultActions** *(list) --* 

            The actions to take on a fragmented UDP packet if it doesn't match any of the stateless rules in the policy. Network Firewall only manages UDP packet fragments and silently drops packet fragments for other protocols. If you want non-matching fragmented UDP packets to be forwarded for stateful inspection, specify ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` . 

             

            You must specify one of the standard actions: ``aws:pass`` , ``aws:drop`` , or ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` . In addition, you can specify custom actions that are compatible with your standard section choice.

             

            For example, you could specify ``["aws:pass"]`` or you could specify ``["aws:pass", “customActionName”]`` . For information about compatibility, see the custom action descriptions under  CustomAction .

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **StatelessCustomActions** *(list) --* 

            The custom action definitions that are available for use in the firewall policy's ``StatelessDefaultActions`` setting. You name each custom action that you define, and then you can use it by name in your default actions specifications.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              An optional, non-standard action to use for stateless packet handling. You can define this in addition to the standard action that you must specify. 

               

              You define and name the custom actions that you want to be able to use, and then you reference them by name in your actions settings. 

               

              You can use custom actions in the following places: 

               

               
              * In a rule group's  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specification. The custom actions are available for use by name inside the ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` where you define them. You can use them for your stateless rule actions to specify what to do with a packet that matches the rule's match attributes.  
               
              * In a  FirewallPolicy specification, in ``StatelessCustomActions`` . The custom actions are available for use inside the policy where you define them. You can use them for the policy's default stateless actions settings to specify what to do with packets that don't match any of the policy's stateless rules.  
               

              
              

              - **ActionName** *(string) --* 

                The descriptive name of the custom action. You can't change the name of a custom action after you create it.

                
              

              - **ActionDefinition** *(dict) --* 

                The custom action associated with the action name.

                
                

                - **PublishMetricAction** *(dict) --* 

                  Stateless inspection criteria that publishes the specified metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for the matching packet. This setting defines a CloudWatch dimension value to be published.

                   

                  You can pair this custom action with any of the standard stateless rule actions. For example, you could pair this in a rule action with the standard action that forwards the packet for stateful inspection. Then, when a packet matches the rule, Network Firewall publishes metrics for the packet and forwards it. 

                  
                  

                  - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

                    

                    
                    

                    - *(dict) --* 

                      The value to use in an Amazon CloudWatch custom metric dimension. This is used in the ``PublishMetrics``   CustomAction . A CloudWatch custom metric dimension is a name/value pair that's part of the identity of a metric. 

                       

                      AWS Network Firewall sets the dimension name to ``CustomAction`` and you provide the dimension value. 

                       

                      For more information about CloudWatch custom metric dimensions, see `Publishing Custom Metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#usingDimensions>`__ in the `Amazon CloudWatch User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html>`__ .

                      
                      

                      - **Value** *(string) --* 

                        The value to use in the custom metric dimension.

                        
                  
                
              
            
          
        
          

          - **StatefulRuleGroupReferences** *(list) --* 

            References to the stateless rule groups that are used in the policy. These define the inspection criteria in stateful rules. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Identifier for a single stateful rule group, used in a firewall policy to refer to a rule group. 

              
              

              - **ResourceArn** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stateful rule group.

        - **LoggingConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

          Defines how AWS Network Firewall performs logging for a  Firewall . 

          
          

          - **LogDestinationConfigs** *(list) --* 

            Defines the logging destinations for the logs for a firewall. Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups. 

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Defines where AWS Network Firewall sends logs for the firewall for one log type. This is used in  LoggingConfiguration . You can send each type of log to an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch log group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

               

              Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups. You can save alert and flow log types. The stateful rules engine records flow logs for all network traffic that it receives. It records alert logs for traffic that matches stateful rules that have the rule action set to ``DROP`` or ``ALERT`` . 

              
              

              - **LogType** *(string) --* 

                The type of log to send. Alert logs report traffic that matches a  StatefulRule with an action setting that sends an alert log message. Flow logs are standard network traffic flow logs. 

                
              

              - **LogDestinationType** *(string) --*

    :param RuleGroupName: 

      The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a rule group after you create it.

       

      You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both. 

      

    
    :type RuleGroupArn: string
    :param RuleGroupArn: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

       

      You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both. 

      

    
    :type Type: string
    :param Type: 

      Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it contains stateful rules. 

       

      .. note::

         

        This setting is required for requests that do not include the ``RuleGroupARN`` .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **UpdateToken** *(string) --* 

          A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the rule group. The token marks the state of the rule group resource at the time of the request. 

           

          To make changes to the rule group, you provide the token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the rule group hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an ``InvalidTokenException`` . If this happens, retrieve the rule group again to get a current copy of it with a current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token. 

          
        

        - **RuleGroup** *(dict) --* 

          The object that defines the rules in a rule group. This, along with  RuleGroupResponse , define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects for a rule group by calling  DescribeRuleGroup . 

           

          AWS Network Firewall uses a rule group to inspect and control network traffic. You define stateless rule groups to inspect individual packets and you define stateful rule groups to inspect packets in the context of their traffic flow. 

           

          To use a rule group, you include it by reference in an Network Firewall firewall policy, then you use the policy in a firewall. You can reference a rule group from more than one firewall policy, and you can use a firewall policy in more than one firewall. 

          
          

          - **RuleVariables** *(dict) --* 

            Settings that are available for use in the rules in the rule group. You can only use these for stateful rule groups. 

            
            

            - **IPSets** *(dict) --* 

              A list of IP addresses and address ranges, in CIDR notation. 

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A list of IP addresses and address ranges, in CIDR notation. This is part of a  RuleVariables . 

                  
                  

                  - **Definition** *(list) --* 

                    The list of IP addresses and address ranges, in CIDR notation. 

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
          
        
            

            - **PortSets** *(dict) --* 

              A list of port ranges. 

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A set of port ranges for use in the rules in a rule group. 

                  
                  

                  - **Definition** *(list) --* 

                    The set of port ranges.

          - **RulesSource** *(dict) --* 

            The stateful rules or stateless rules for the rule group. 

            
            

            - **RulesString** *(string) --* 

              Stateful inspection criteria, provided in Suricata compatible intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules. Suricata is an open-source network IPS that includes a standard rule-based language for network traffic inspection.

               

              These rules contain the inspection criteria and the action to take for traffic that matches the criteria, so this type of rule group doesn't have a separate action setting.

              
            

            - **RulesSourceList** *(dict) --* 

              Stateful inspection criteria for a domain list rule group. 

              
              

              - **Targets** *(list) --* 

                The domains that you want to inspect for in your traffic flows. To provide multiple domains, separate them with commas. Valid domain specifications are the following:

                 

                 
                * Explicit names. For example, ``abc.example.com`` matches only the domain ``abc.example.com`` . 
                 
                * Names that use a domain wildcard, which you indicate with an initial '``.`` '. For example,``.example.com`` matches ``example.com`` and matches all subdomains of ``example.com`` , such as ``abc.example.com`` and ``www.example.com`` .  
                 

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **TargetTypes** *(list) --* 

                The protocols you want to inspect. Specify ``TLS_SNI`` for ``HTTPS`` . Specity ``HTTP_HOST`` for ``HTTP`` . You can specify either or both. 

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
              

              - **GeneratedRulesType** *(string) --*

            - **StatefulRules** *(list) --* 

              The 5-tuple stateful inspection criteria. This contains an array of individual 5-tuple stateful rules to be used together in a stateful rule group. 

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A single 5-tuple stateful rule, for use in a stateful rule group.

                
                

                - **Action** *(string) --* 

                  Defines what Network Firewall should do with the packets in a traffic flow when the flow matches the stateful rule criteria. For all actions, Network Firewall performs the specified action and discontinues stateful inspection of the traffic flow. 

                   

                  The actions for a stateful rule are defined as follows: 

                   

                   
                  * **PASS** - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination. 
                   
                  * **DROP** - Blocks the packets from going to the intended destination and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the  Firewall   LoggingConfiguration .  
                   
                  * **ALERT** - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the  Firewall   LoggingConfiguration .  You can use this action to test a rule that you intend to use to drop traffic. You can enable the rule with ``ALERT`` action, verify in the logs that the rule is filtering as you want, then change the action to ``DROP`` . 
                   

                  
                

                - **Header** *(dict) --* 

                  The stateful 5-tuple inspection criteria for this rule, used to inspect traffic flows. 

                  
                  

                  - **Protocol** *(string) --* 

                    The protocol to inspect for. To specify all, you can use ``IP`` , because all traffic on AWS and on the internet is IP.

                    
                  

                  - **Source** *(string) --*

                        Network Firewall only forwards a packet for stateful rule inspection if you specify ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` for a rule that the packet matches, or if the packet doesn't match any stateless rule and you specify ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` for the ``StatelessDefaultActions`` setting for the  FirewallPolicy .

                         

                       

                      For every rule, you must specify exactly one of the following standard actions. 

                       

                       
                      * **aws:pass** - Discontinues all inspection of the packet and permits it to go to its intended destination. 
                       
                      * **aws:drop** - Discontinues all inspection of the packet and blocks it from going to its intended destination. 
                       
                      * **aws:forward_to_sfe** - Discontinues stateless inspection of the packet and forwards it to the stateful rule engine for inspection.  
                       

                       

                      Additionally, you can specify a custom action. To do this, you define a custom action by name and type, then provide the name you've assigned to the action in this ``Actions`` setting. For information about the options, see  CustomAction . 

                       

                      To provide more than one action in this setting, separate the settings with a comma. For example, if you have a custom ``PublishMetrics`` action that you've named ``MyMetricsAction`` , then you could specify the standard action ``aws:pass`` and the custom action with ``[“aws:pass”, “MyMetricsAction”]`` . 

                      
                      

                      - *(string) --* 
                  
                
                  

                  - **Priority** *(integer) --* 

                    A setting that indicates the order in which to run this rule relative to all of the rules that are defined for a stateless rule group. Network Firewall evaluates the rules in a rule group starting with the lowest priority setting. You must ensure that the priority settings are unique for the rule group. 

                     

                    Each stateless rule group uses exactly one ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` object, and each ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` contains exactly one ``StatelessRules`` object. To ensure unique priority settings for your rule groups, set unique priorities for the stateless rules that you define inside any single ``StatelessRules`` object.

                     

                    You can change the priority settings of your rules at any time. To make it easier to insert rules later, number them so there's a wide range in between, for example use 100, 200, and so on. 

                    
              
            
              

              - **CustomActions** *(list) --* 

                Defines an array of individual custom action definitions that are available for use by the stateless rules in this ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` specification. You name each custom action that you define, and then you can use it by name in your  StatelessRule   RuleDefinition  ``Actions`` specification.

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  An optional, non-standard action to use for stateless packet handling. You can define this in addition to the standard action that you must specify. 

                   

                  You define and name the custom actions that you want to be able to use, and then you reference them by name in your actions settings. 

                   

                  You can use custom actions in the following places: 

                   

                   
                  * In a rule group's  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specification. The custom actions are available for use by name inside the ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` where you define them. You can use them for your stateless rule actions to specify what to do with a packet that matches the rule's match attributes.  
                   
                  * In a  FirewallPolicy specification, in ``StatelessCustomActions`` . The custom actions are available for use inside the policy where you define them. You can use them for the policy's default stateless actions settings to specify what to do with packets that don't match any of the policy's stateless rules.  
                   

                  
                  

                  - **ActionName** *(string) --* 

                    The descriptive name of the custom action. You can't change the name of a custom action after you create it.

                    
                  

                  - **ActionDefinition** *(dict) --* 

                    The custom action associated with the action name.

                    
                    

                    - **PublishMetricAction** *(dict) --* 

                      Stateless inspection criteria that publishes the specified metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for the matching packet. This setting defines a CloudWatch dimension value to be published.

                       

                      You can pair this custom action with any of the standard stateless rule actions. For example, you could pair this in a rule action with the standard action that forwards the packet for stateful inspection. Then, when a packet matches the rule, Network Firewall publishes metrics for the packet and forwards it. 

                      
                      

                      - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

                        

                        
                        

                        - *(dict) --* 

                          The value to use in an Amazon CloudWatch custom metric dimension. This is used in the ``PublishMetrics``   CustomAction . A CloudWatch custom metric dimension is a name/value pair that's part of the identity of a metric. 

                           

                          AWS Network Firewall sets the dimension name to ``CustomAction`` and you provide the dimension value. 

                           

                          For more information about CloudWatch custom metric dimensions, see `Publishing Custom Metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#usingDimensions>`__ in the `Amazon CloudWatch User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html>`__ .

                          
                          

                          - **Value** *(string) --* 

                            The value to use in the custom metric dimension.

                            
                      
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
        

        - **RuleGroupResponse** *(dict) --* 

          The high-level properties of a rule group. This, along with the  RuleGroup , define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects for a rule group by calling  DescribeRuleGroup . 

          
          

          - **RuleGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

             

            .. note::

               

              If this response is for a create request that had ``DryRun`` set to ``TRUE`` , then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't attached to a valid resource.

               

            
          

          - **RuleGroupName** *(string) --* 

            The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a rule group after you create it.

            
          

          - **RuleGroupId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the rule group. 

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            A description of the rule group. 

            
          

          - **Type** *(string) --* 

            Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it contains stateful rules. 

            
          

          - **Capacity** *(integer) --* 

            The maximum operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group, you are limited to this capacity. When you reference a rule group from a firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves this capacity for the rule group. 

             

            You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule group before you create the rule group by calling  CreateRuleGroup with ``DryRun`` set to ``TRUE`` . 

            
          

          - **RuleGroupStatus** *(string) --* 

            Detailed information about the current status of a rule group. 

            
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A key:value pair associated with an AWS resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource. 

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a category, such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensitive.

    :type UpdateToken: string
    :param UpdateToken: 

      An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall. The token marks the state of the firewall resource at the time of the request. 

       

      To make an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in your update request. Without the token, Network Firewall performs your updates regardless of whether the firewall has changed since you last retrieved it.

       

      To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an ``InvalidTokenException`` . If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy of it with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token.

    :type UpdateToken: string
    :param UpdateToken: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall policy. The token marks the state of the policy resource at the time of the request. 

       

      To make changes to the policy, you provide the token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the policy hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an ``InvalidTokenException`` . If this happens, retrieve the firewall policy again to get a current copy of it with current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token. 

      

    
    :type FirewallPolicyArn: string
    :param FirewallPolicyArn: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

       

      You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both. 

      

    
    :type FirewallPolicyName: string
    :param FirewallPolicyName: 

      The descriptive name of the firewall policy. You can't change the name of a firewall policy after you create it.

       

      You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both. 

      

    
    :type FirewallPolicy: dict
    :param FirewallPolicy: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The updated firewall policy to use for the firewall. 

      

    
      - **StatelessRuleGroupReferences** *(list) --* 

        References to the stateless rule groups that are used in the policy. These define the matching criteria in stateless rules. 

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Identifier for a single stateless rule group, used in a firewall policy to refer to the rule group. 

          

        
          - **ResourceArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stateless rule group.

            

          
          - **Priority** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            An integer setting that indicates the order in which to run the stateless rule groups in a single  FirewallPolicy . Network Firewall applies each stateless rule group to a packet starting with the group that has the lowest priority setting. You must ensure that the priority settings are unique within each policy.

            

          
        
    
      - **StatelessDefaultActions** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The actions to take on a packet if it doesn't match any of the stateless rules in the policy. If you want non-matching packets to be forwarded for stateful inspection, specify ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` . 

         

        You must specify one of the standard actions: ``aws:pass`` , ``aws:drop`` , or ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` . In addition, you can specify custom actions that are compatible with your standard section choice.

         

        For example, you could specify ``["aws:pass"]`` or you could specify ``["aws:pass", “customActionName”]`` . For information about compatibility, see the custom action descriptions under  CustomAction .

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **StatelessFragmentDefaultActions** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The actions to take on a fragmented UDP packet if it doesn't match any of the stateless rules in the policy. Network Firewall only manages UDP packet fragments and silently drops packet fragments for other protocols. If you want non-matching fragmented UDP packets to be forwarded for stateful inspection, specify ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` . 

         

        You must specify one of the standard actions: ``aws:pass`` , ``aws:drop`` , or ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` . In addition, you can specify custom actions that are compatible with your standard section choice.

         

        For example, you could specify ``["aws:pass"]`` or you could specify ``["aws:pass", “customActionName”]`` . For information about compatibility, see the custom action descriptions under  CustomAction .

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **StatelessCustomActions** *(list) --* 

        The custom action definitions that are available for use in the firewall policy's ``StatelessDefaultActions`` setting. You name each custom action that you define, and then you can use it by name in your default actions specifications.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          An optional, non-standard action to use for stateless packet handling. You can define this in addition to the standard action that you must specify. 

           

          You define and name the custom actions that you want to be able to use, and then you reference them by name in your actions settings. 

           

          You can use custom actions in the following places: 

           

           
          * In a rule group's  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specification. The custom actions are available for use by name inside the ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` where you define them. You can use them for your stateless rule actions to specify what to do with a packet that matches the rule's match attributes.  
           
          * In a  FirewallPolicy specification, in ``StatelessCustomActions`` . The custom actions are available for use inside the policy where you define them. You can use them for the policy's default stateless actions settings to specify what to do with packets that don't match any of the policy's stateless rules.  
           

          

        
          - **ActionName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The descriptive name of the custom action. You can't change the name of a custom action after you create it.

            

          
          - **ActionDefinition** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The custom action associated with the action name.

            

          
            - **PublishMetricAction** *(dict) --* 

              Stateless inspection criteria that publishes the specified metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for the matching packet. This setting defines a CloudWatch dimension value to be published.

               

              You can pair this custom action with any of the standard stateless rule actions. For example, you could pair this in a rule action with the standard action that forwards the packet for stateful inspection. Then, when a packet matches the rule, Network Firewall publishes metrics for the packet and forwards it. 

              

            
              - **Dimensions** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                

                

              
                - *(dict) --* 

                  The value to use in an Amazon CloudWatch custom metric dimension. This is used in the ``PublishMetrics``   CustomAction . A CloudWatch custom metric dimension is a name/value pair that's part of the identity of a metric. 

                   

                  AWS Network Firewall sets the dimension name to ``CustomAction`` and you provide the dimension value. 

                   

                  For more information about CloudWatch custom metric dimensions, see `Publishing Custom Metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#usingDimensions>`__ in the `Amazon CloudWatch User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html>`__ .

                  

                
                  - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    The value to use in the custom metric dimension.

                    

                  
                
            
            
          
        
    
      - **StatefulRuleGroupReferences** *(list) --* 

        References to the stateless rule groups that are used in the policy. These define the inspection criteria in stateful rules. 

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Identifier for a single stateful rule group, used in a firewall policy to refer to a rule group. 

          

        
          - **ResourceArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stateful rule group.

            

          
        
    
    
    :type Description: string
    :param Description: 

      A description of the firewall policy.

      

    
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the validity of the request, rather than run the request. 

       

      If set to ``TRUE`` , Network Firewall checks whether the request can run successfully, but doesn't actually make the requested changes. The call returns the value that the request would return if you ran it with dry run set to ``FALSE`` , but doesn't make additions or changes to your resources. This option allows you to make sure that you have the required permissions to run the request and that your request parameters are valid. 

       

      If set to ``FALSE`` , Network Firewall makes the requested changes to your resources.

    :type UpdateToken: string
    :param UpdateToken: 

      An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall. The token marks the state of the firewall resource at the time of the request. 

       

      To make an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in your update request. Without the token, Network Firewall performs your updates regardless of whether the firewall has changed since you last retrieved it.

       

      To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an ``InvalidTokenException`` . If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy of it with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token. 

      

    
    :type FirewallArn: string
    :param FirewallArn: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

    :param FirewallPolicyChangeProtection: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against a change to the firewall policy association. Use this setting to protect against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting to ``TRUE`` .

  .. py:method:: update_logging_configuration(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the logging configuration for the specified firewall. 

     

    To change the logging configuration, retrieve the  LoggingConfiguration by calling  DescribeLoggingConfiguration , then change it and provide the modified object to this update call. You must change the logging configuration one  LogDestinationConfig at a time inside the retrieved  LoggingConfiguration object. 

     

    You can perform only one of the following actions in any call to ``UpdateLoggingConfiguration`` : 

     

     
    * Create a new log destination object by adding a single ``LogDestinationConfig`` array element to ``LogDestinationConfigs`` . 
     
    * Delete a log destination object by removing a single ``LogDestinationConfig`` array element from ``LogDestinationConfigs`` . 
     
    * Change the ``LogDestination`` setting in a single ``LogDestinationConfig`` array element. 
     

     

    You can't change the ``LogDestinationType`` or ``LogType`` in a ``LogDestinationConfig`` . To change these settings, delete the existing ``LogDestinationConfig`` object and create a new one, using two separate calls to this update operation.

    :type LoggingConfiguration: dict
    :param LoggingConfiguration: 

      Defines how Network Firewall performs logging for a firewall. If you omit this setting, Network Firewall disables logging for the firewall.

      

    
      - **LogDestinationConfigs** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Defines the logging destinations for the logs for a firewall. Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups. 

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Defines where AWS Network Firewall sends logs for the firewall for one log type. This is used in  LoggingConfiguration . You can send each type of log to an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch log group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

           

          Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups. You can save alert and flow log types. The stateful rules engine records flow logs for all network traffic that it receives. It records alert logs for traffic that matches stateful rules that have the rule action set to ``DROP`` or ``ALERT`` . 

          

        
          - **LogType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The type of log to send. Alert logs report traffic that matches a  StatefulRule with an action setting that sends an alert log message. Flow logs are standard network traffic flow logs. 

            

          
          - **LogDestinationType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The type of storage destination to send these logs to. You can send logs to an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch log group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

            

          
          - **LogDestination** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The named location for the logs, provided in a key:value mapping that is specific to the chosen destination type. 

             

             
            * For an Amazon S3 bucket, provide the name of the bucket, with key ``bucketName`` , and optionally provide a prefix, with key ``prefix`` . The following example specifies an Amazon S3 bucket named ``DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET`` and the prefix ``alerts`` :   ``"LogDestination": { "bucketName": "DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET", "prefix": "alerts" }``   
             
            * For a CloudWatch log group, provide the name of the CloudWatch log group, with key ``logGroup`` . The following example specifies a log group named ``alert-log-group`` :   ``"LogDestination": { "logGroup": "alert-log-group" }``   
             
            * For a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, provide the name of the delivery stream, with key ``deliveryStream`` . The following example specifies a delivery stream named ``alert-delivery-stream`` :   ``"LogDestination": { "deliveryStream": "alert-delivery-stream" }``

    :type UpdateToken: string
    :param UpdateToken: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the rule group. The token marks the state of the rule group resource at the time of the request. 

       

      To make changes to the rule group, you provide the token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the rule group hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an ``InvalidTokenException`` . If this happens, retrieve the rule group again to get a current copy of it with a current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token. 

      

    
    :type RuleGroupArn: string
    :param RuleGroupArn: 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

    :type RuleGroupName: string
    :param RuleGroupName: 

      The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a rule group after you create it.

       

      You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both. 

      

    
    :type RuleGroup: dict
    :param RuleGroup: 

      An object that defines the rule group rules. 

       

      .. note::

         

        You must provide either this rule group setting or a ``Rules`` setting, but not both. 

         

      

    
      - **RuleVariables** *(dict) --* 

        Settings that are available for use in the rules in the rule group. You can only use these for stateful rule groups. 

        

      
        - **IPSets** *(dict) --* 

          A list of IP addresses and address ranges, in CIDR notation.

          Stateful inspection criteria, provided in Suricata compatible intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules. Suricata is an open-source network IPS that includes a standard rule-based language for network traffic inspection.

           

          These rules contain the inspection criteria and the action to take for traffic that matches the criteria, so this type of rule group doesn't have a separate action setting.

          

        
        - **RulesSourceList** *(dict) --* 

          Stateful inspection criteria for a domain list rule group. 

          

        
          - **Targets** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The domains that you want to inspect for in your traffic flows. To provide multiple domains, separate them with commas. Valid domain specifications are the following:

             

             
            * Explicit names. For example, ``abc.example.com`` matches only the domain ``abc.example.com`` . 
             
            * Names that use a domain wildcard, which you indicate with an initial '``.`` '. For example,``.example.com`` matches ``example.com`` and matches all subdomains of ``example.com`` , such as ``abc.example.com`` and ``www.example.com`` .

          - **GeneratedRulesType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Whether you want to allow or deny access to the domains in your target list.

            

          
        
        - **StatefulRules** *(list) --* 

          The 5-tuple stateful inspection criteria. This contains an array of individual 5-tuple stateful rules to be used together in a stateful rule group. 

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            A single 5-tuple stateful rule, for use in a stateful rule group.

            

          
            - **Action** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              Defines what Network Firewall should do with the packets in a traffic flow when the flow matches the stateful rule criteria. For all actions, Network Firewall performs the specified action and discontinues stateful inspection of the traffic flow. 

               

              The actions for a stateful rule are defined as follows: 

               

               
              * **PASS** - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination. 
               
              * **DROP** - Blocks the packets from going to the intended destination and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the  Firewall   LoggingConfiguration .  
               
              * **ALERT** - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the  Firewall   LoggingConfiguration .  You can use this action to test a rule that you intend to use to drop traffic. You can enable the rule with ``ALERT`` action, verify in the logs that the rule is filtering as you want, then change the action to ``DROP`` . 
               

              

            
            - **Header** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The stateful 5-tuple inspection criteria for this rule, used to inspect traffic flows. 

              

            
              - **Protocol** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The protocol to inspect for. To specify all, you can use ``IP`` , because all traffic on AWS and on the internet is IP.

                

              
              - **Source** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The source IP address or address range to inspect for, in CIDR notation. To match with any address, specify ``ANY`` . 

                 

                Specify an IP address or a block of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. Network Firewall supports all address ranges for IPv4.

              - **SourcePort** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The source port to inspect for. You can specify an individual port, for example ``1994`` and you can specify a port range, for example ``1990-1994`` . To match with any port, specify ``ANY`` . 

                

              
              - **Direction** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The direction of traffic flow to inspect. If set to ``ANY`` , the inspection matches bidirectional traffic, both from the source to the destination and from the destination to the source. If set to ``FORWARD`` , the inspection only matches traffic going from the source to the destination. 

                

              
              - **Destination** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The destination IP address or address range to inspect for, in CIDR notation. To match with any address, specify ``ANY`` . 

                 

                Specify an IP address or a block of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. Network Firewall supports all address ranges for IPv4.

                      - **FromPort** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                        The lower limit of the port range. This must be less than or equal to the ``ToPort`` specification. 

                        

                      
                      - **ToPort** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                        The upper limit of the port range. This must be greater than or equal to the ``FromPort`` specification. 

                        

                      
                    
                
                  - **DestinationPorts** *(list) --* 

                    The destination ports to inspect for. If not specified, this matches with any destination port. This setting is only used for protocols 6 (TCP) and 17 (UDP).

                    - *(dict) --* 

                      A single port range specification. This is used for source and destination port ranges in the stateless rule  MatchAttributes , ``SourcePorts`` , and ``DestinationPorts`` settings. 

                      

                    
                      - **FromPort** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                        The lower limit of the port range. This must be less than or equal to the ``ToPort`` specification.

                    - *(integer) --* 

                    
                
                  - **TCPFlags** *(list) --* 

                    The TCP flags and masks to inspect for. If not specified, this matches with any settings. This setting is only used for protocol 6 (TCP).

                    

                  
                    - *(dict) --* 

                      TCP flags and masks to inspect packets for, used in stateless rules  MatchAttributes settings.

                      

                    
                      - **Flags** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                        Used in conjunction with the ``Masks`` setting to define the flags that must be set and flags that must not be set in order for the packet to match. This setting can only specify values that are also specified in the ``Masks`` setting.

                         

                        For the flags that are specified in the masks setting, the following must be true for the packet to match: 

                         

                         
                        * The ones that are set in this flags setting must be set in the packet.  
                         
                        * The ones that are not set in this flags setting must also not be set in the packet.  
                         

                        

                      
                        - *(string) --* 

                        
                    
                      - **Masks** *(list) --* 

                        The set of flags to consider in the inspection. To inspect all flags in the valid values list, leave this with no setting.

                        

                      
                        - *(string) --* 

                        
                    
                    
                
                
                - **Actions** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The actions to take on a packet that matches one of the stateless rule definition's match attributes. You must specify a standard action and you can add custom actions. 

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Network Firewall only forwards a packet for stateful rule inspection if you specify ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` for a rule that the packet matches, or if the packet doesn't match any stateless rule and you specify ``aws:forward_to_sfe`` for the ``StatelessDefaultActions`` setting for the  FirewallPolicy .

                     

                   

                  For every rule, you must specify exactly one of the following standard actions. 

                   

                   
                  * **aws:pass** - Discontinues all inspection of the packet and permits it to go to its intended destination. 
                   
                  * **aws:drop** - Discontinues all inspection of the packet and blocks it from going to its intended destination. 
                   
                  * **aws:forward_to_sfe** - Discontinues stateless inspection of the packet and forwards it to the stateful rule engine for inspection.  
                   

                   

                  Additionally, you can specify a custom action. To do this, you define a custom action by name and type, then provide the name you've assigned to the action in this ``Actions`` setting. For information about the options, see  CustomAction . 

                   

                  To provide more than one action in this setting, separate the settings with a comma. For example, if you have a custom ``PublishMetrics`` action that you've named ``MyMetricsAction`` , then you could specify the standard action ``aws:pass`` and the custom action with ``[“aws:pass”, “MyMetricsAction”]`` . 

                  

                
                  - *(string) --* 

                  
              
              
              - **Priority** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                A setting that indicates the order in which to run this rule relative to all of the rules that are defined for a stateless rule group. Network Firewall evaluates the rules in a rule group starting with the lowest priority setting. You must ensure that the priority settings are unique for the rule group. 

                 

                Each stateless rule group uses exactly one ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` object, and each ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` contains exactly one ``StatelessRules`` object. To ensure unique priority settings for your rule groups, set unique priorities for the stateless rules that you define inside any single ``StatelessRules`` object.

                 

                You can change the priority settings of your rules at any time. To make it easier to insert rules later, number them so there's a wide range in between, for example use 100, 200, and so on. 

                

              
            
        
          - **CustomActions** *(list) --* 

            Defines an array of individual custom action definitions that are available for use by the stateless rules in this ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` specification. You name each custom action that you define, and then you can use it by name in your  StatelessRule   RuleDefinition  ``Actions`` specification.

            

          
            - *(dict) --* 

              An optional, non-standard action to use for stateless packet handling. You can define this in addition to the standard action that you must specify. 

               

              You define and name the custom actions that you want to be able to use, and then you reference them by name in your actions settings. 

               

              You can use custom actions in the following places: 

               

               
              * In a rule group's  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specification. The custom actions are available for use by name inside the ``StatelessRulesAndCustomActions`` where you define them. You can use them for your stateless rule actions to specify what to do with a packet that matches the rule's match attributes.  
               
              * In a  FirewallPolicy specification, in ``StatelessCustomActions`` . The custom actions are available for use inside the policy where you define them. You can use them for the policy's default stateless actions settings to specify what to do with packets that don't match any of the policy's stateless rules.  
               

              

            
              - **ActionName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The descriptive name of the custom action. You can't change the name of a custom action after you create it.

                

              
              - **ActionDefinition** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The custom action associated with the action name.

                

              
                - **PublishMetricAction** *(dict) --* 

                  Stateless inspection criteria that publishes the specified metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for the matching packet. This setting defines a CloudWatch dimension value to be published.

                   

                  You can pair this custom action with any of the standard stateless rule actions. For example, you could pair this in a rule action with the standard action that forwards the packet for stateful inspection. Then, when a packet matches the rule, Network Firewall publishes metrics for the packet and forwards it. 

                  

                
                  - **Dimensions** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                    

                    

                  
                    - *(dict) --* 

                      The value to use in an Amazon CloudWatch custom metric dimension. This is used in the ``PublishMetrics``   CustomAction . A CloudWatch custom metric dimension is a name/value pair that's part of the identity of a metric. 

                       

                      AWS Network Firewall sets the dimension name to ``CustomAction`` and you provide the dimension value. 

                       

                      For more information about CloudWatch custom metric dimensions, see `Publishing Custom Metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#usingDimensions>`__ in the `Amazon CloudWatch User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html>`__ .

                      

                    
                      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                        The value to use in the custom metric dimension.

                        

                      
                    
                
                
              
            
        
        
      
    
    :type Rules: string
    :param Rules: 

      A string containing stateful rule group rules specifications in Suricata flat format, with one rule per line. Use this to import your existing Suricata compatible rule groups. 

       

      .. note::

         

        You must provide either this rules setting or a populated ``RuleGroup`` setting, but not both. 

         

       

      You can provide your rule group specification in Suricata flat format through this setting when you create or update your rule group. The call response returns a  RuleGroup object that Network Firewall has populated from your string. 

      

    
    :type Type: string
    :param Type: 

      Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it contains stateful rules. 

       

      .. note::

         

        This setting is required for requests that do not include the ``RuleGroupARN`` .

         

      

    
    :type Description: string
    :param Description: 

      A description of the rule group. 

      

    
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the validity of the request, rather than run the request. 

       

      If set to ``TRUE`` , Network Firewall checks whether the request can run successfully, but doesn't actually make the requested changes. The call returns the value that the request would return if you ran it with dry run set to ``FALSE`` , but doesn't make additions or changes to your resources. This option allows you to make sure that you have the required permissions to run the request and that your request parameters are valid. 

       

      If set to ``FALSE`` , Network Firewall makes the requested changes to your resources.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **UpdateToken** *(string) --* 

          A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the rule group. The token marks the state of the rule group resource at the time of the request. 

           

          To make changes to the rule group, you provide the token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the rule group hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an ``InvalidTokenException`` . If this happens, retrieve the rule group again to get a current copy of it with a current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token. 

          
        

        - **RuleGroupResponse** *(dict) --* 

          The high-level properties of a rule group. This, along with the  RuleGroup , define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects for a rule group by calling  DescribeRuleGroup . 

          
          

          - **RuleGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

            Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it contains stateful rules. 

            
          

          - **Capacity** *(integer) --* 

            The maximum operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group, you are limited to this capacity. When you reference a rule group from a firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves this capacity for the rule group. 

             

            You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule group before you create the rule group by calling  CreateRuleGroup with ``DryRun`` set to ``TRUE`` . 

            
          

          - **RuleGroupStatus** *(string) --* 

            Detailed information about the current status of a rule group. 

            
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A key:value pair associated with an AWS resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource. 

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a category, such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensitive.

    :param UpdateToken: 

      An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall. The token marks the state of the firewall resource at the time of the request. 

       

      To make an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in your update request. Without the token, Network Firewall performs your updates regardless of whether the firewall has changed since you last retrieved it.

       

      To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an ``InvalidTokenException`` . If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy of it with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token.
