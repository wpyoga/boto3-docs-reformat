.. py:class:: IAM.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
   

  Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to Amazon Web Services services. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which Amazon Web Services resources users and applications can access. For more information about IAM, see `Identity and Access Management (IAM) <http://aws.amazon.com/iam/>`__ and the `Identity and Access Management User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/>`__ .

  .. py:method:: add_client_id_to_open_id_connect_provider(**kwargs)

    

    Adds a new client ID (also known as audience) to the list of client IDs already registered for the specified IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource.

     

    This operation is idempotent; it does not fail or return an error if you add an existing client ID to the provider.

    

    See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/iam-2010-05-08/AddClientIDToOpenIDConnectProvider>`_    


    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.add_client_id_to_open_id_connect_provider(
          OpenIDConnectProviderArn='string',
          ClientID='string'
      )
    :type OpenIDConnectProviderArn: string
    :param OpenIDConnectProviderArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource to add the client ID to. You can get a list of OIDC provider ARNs by using the  ListOpenIDConnectProviders operation.

      

    
    :type ClientID: string
    :param ClientID: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The client ID (also known as audience) to add to the IAM OpenID Connect provider resource.

      

    
    
    :returns: None
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`IAM.Client.exceptions.InvalidInputException`

    
    *     :py:class:`IAM.Client.exceptions.NoSuchEntityException`

    
    *     :py:class:`IAM.Client.exceptions.LimitExceededException`

    
    *     :py:class:`IAM.Client.exceptions.ServiceFailureException`

    

    **Examples** 

    The following add-client-id-to-open-id-connect-provider command adds the client ID my-application-ID to the OIDC provider named server.example.com:
    ::

      response = client.add_client_id_to_open_id_connect_provider(
          ClientID='my-application-ID',
          OpenIDConnectProviderArn='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/server.example.com',
      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

      {
          'ResponseMetadata': {
              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: add_role_to_instance_profile(**kwargs)

    

    Adds the specified IAM role to the specified instance profile. An instance profile can contain only one role, and this quota cannot be increased. You can remove the existing role and then add a different role to an instance profile. You must then wait for the change to appear across all of Amazon Web Services because of `eventual consistency <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency>`__ . To force the change, you must `disassociate the instance profile <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DisassociateIamInstanceProfile.html>`__ and then `associate the instance profile <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AssociateIamInstanceProfile.html>`__ , or you can stop your instance and then restart it.

     

    .. note::

       

      The caller of this operation must be granted the ``PassRole`` permission on the IAM role by a permissions policy.

       

     

    For more information about roles, see `Working with roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html>`__ .

    .. note::

       

      You cannot use a managed policy as the role's trust policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using  CreateRole . You can update a role's trust policy using  UpdateAssumeRolePolicy .

       

     

    Use this operation to attach a *managed* policy to a role. To embed an inline policy in a role, use  PutRolePolicy . For more information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see `Validating IAM policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,

  .. py:method:: change_password(**kwargs)

    

    Changes the password of the IAM user who is calling this operation. This operation can be performed using the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the **My Security Credentials** page in the Management Console. The account root user password is not affected by this operation.

     

    Use  UpdateLoginProfile to use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the **Users** page in the IAM console to change the password for any IAM user. For more information about modifying passwords, see `Managing passwords <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingLogins.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      The IAM user's current password.

      

    
    :type NewPassword: string
    :param NewPassword: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The new password. The new password must conform to the account's password policy, if one exists.

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ that is used to validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can include almost any printable ASCII character from the space (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range (``\u00FF`` ). You can also include the tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password. However, many tools, such as the Management Console, might restrict the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning within that tool.

  .. py:method:: create_access_key(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new Amazon Web Services secret access key and corresponding Amazon Web Services access key ID for the specified user. The default status for new keys is ``Active`` .

     

    If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials. This is true even if the account has no associated users.

     

    For information about quotas on the number of keys you can create, see `IAM and STS quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    .. warning::

       

      To ensure the security of your account, the secret access key is accessible only during key and user creation. You must save the key (for example, in a text file) if you want to be able to access it again. If a secret key is lost, you can delete the access keys for the associated user and then create new keys.

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

      

    
    :type Path: string
    :param Path: 

      The path to the instance profile. For more information about paths, see `IAM Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

       

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).

       

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (``\u0021`` ) through the DEL character (``\u007F`` ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created IAM instance profile. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

       

      .. note::

         

        If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.

         

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

           

          .. note::

             

            Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

  .. py:method:: create_login_profile(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a password for the specified IAM user. A password allows an IAM user to access Amazon Web Services services through the Management Console.

     

    You can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the **Users** page in the IAM console to create a password for any IAM user. Use  ChangePassword to update your own existing password in the **My Security Credentials** page in the Management Console.

     

    For more information about managing passwords, see `Managing passwords <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingLogins.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.create_login_profile(
          UserName='string',
          Password='string',
          PasswordResetRequired=True|False
      )
    :type UserName: string
    :param UserName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the IAM user to create a password for. The user must already exist.

       

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

      

    
    :type Password: string
    :param Password: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The new password for the user.

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ that is used to validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can include almost any printable ASCII character from the space (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range (``\u00FF`` ). You can also include the tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password. However, many tools, such as the Management Console, might restrict the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning within that tool.

      

    
    :type PasswordResetRequired: boolean
    :param PasswordResetRequired: 

      Specifies whether the user is required to set a new password on next sign-in.

  .. py:method:: create_open_id_connect_provider(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that supports `OpenID Connect (OIDC) <http://openid.net/connect/>`__ .

     

    The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider.

     

    If you are using an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito, you don't need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC identity providers are already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available for your use. Instead, you can move directly to creating new roles using your identity provider. To learn more, see `Creating a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:

     

     
    * The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust 
     
    * A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the application or applications allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider 
     
    * A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the IdP uses 
     

     

    You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP that you want to use to access Amazon Web Services.

     

    .. note::

       

      Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation.

       

     

    .. note::

       

      The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the  CreateOpenIDConnectProvider operation to highly privileged users.

    ::

      response = client.create_open_id_connect_provider(

              },
          ]
      )
    :type Url: string
    :param Url: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The URL of the identity provider. The URL must begin with ``https://`` and should correspond to the ``iss`` claim in the provider's OpenID Connect ID tokens. Per the OIDC standard, path components are allowed but query parameters are not. Typically the URL consists of only a hostname, like ``https://server.example.org`` or ``https://example.com`` .

       

      You cannot register the same provider multiple times in a single account. If you try to submit a URL that has already been used for an OpenID Connect provider in the account, you will get an error.

      

    
    :type ClientIDList: list
    :param ClientIDList: 

      A list of client IDs (also known as audiences). When a mobile or web app registers with an OpenID Connect provider, they establish a value that identifies the application. (This is the value that's sent as the ``client_id`` parameter on OAuth requests.)

       

      You can register multiple client IDs with the same provider. For example, you might have multiple applications that use the same OIDC provider. You cannot register more than 100 client IDs with a single IAM OIDC provider.

       

      There is no defined format for a client ID. The ``CreateOpenIDConnectProviderRequest`` operation accepts client IDs up to 255 characters long.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ThumbprintList: list
    :param ThumbprintList: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A list of server certificate thumbprints for the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider's server certificates. Typically this list includes only one entry. However, IAM lets you have up to five thumbprints for an OIDC provider. This lets you maintain multiple thumbprints if the identity provider is rotating certificates.

       

      The server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the X.509 certificate used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. It is always a 40-character string.

       

      You must provide at least one thumbprint when creating an IAM OIDC provider. For example, assume that the OIDC provider is ``server.example.com`` and the provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect. In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com.

       

      For more information about obtaining the OIDC provider's thumbprint, see `Obtaining the thumbprint for an OpenID Connect provider <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/identity-providers-oidc-obtain-thumbprint.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

        Contains a thumbprint for an identity provider's server certificate.

         

        The identity provider's server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the self-signed X.509 certificate. This thumbprint is used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. The thumbprint is always a 40-character string.

        

      
  
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

       

      .. note::

         

        If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.

         

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

           

          .. note::

             

            Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

  .. py:method:: create_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new managed policy for your account.

     

    This operation creates a policy version with a version identifier of ``v1`` and sets v1 as the policy's default version. For more information about policy versions, see `Versioning for managed policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see `Validating IAM policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

    :type PolicyName: string
    :param PolicyName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The friendly name of the policy.

       

      IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

      

    
    :type Path: string
    :param Path: 

      The path for the policy.

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).

       

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (``\u0021`` ) through the DEL character (``\u007F`` ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

      

    
    :type PolicyDocument: string
    :param PolicyDocument: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The JSON policy document that you want to use as the content for the new policy.

       

      You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

       

      The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see `IAM and STS character quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length>`__ .

       

      To learn more about JSON policy grammar, see `Grammar of the IAM JSON policy language <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_grammar.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . 

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

       

       
      * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range 
       
      * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF`` ) 
       
      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) 
       

      

    
    :type Description: string
    :param Description: 

      A friendly description of the policy.

       

      Typically used to store information about the permissions defined in the policy. For example, "Grants access to production DynamoDB tables."

       

      The policy description is immutable. After a value is assigned, it cannot be changed.

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM customer managed policy. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value.

            For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

            
          

          - **IsAttachable** *(boolean) --* 

            Specifies whether the policy can be attached to an IAM user, group, or role.

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            A friendly description of the policy.

             

            This element is included in the response to the  GetPolicy operation. It is not included in the response to the  ListPolicies operation. 

            
          

          - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the policy was created.

            
          

          - **UpdateDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the policy was last updated.

             

            When a policy has only one version, this field contains the date and time when the policy was created. When a policy has more than one version, this field contains the date and time when the most recent policy version was created.

            
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            A list of tags that are attached to the instance profile. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

  .. py:method:: create_policy_version(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new version of the specified managed policy. To update a managed policy, you create a new policy version. A managed policy can have up to five versions. If the policy has five versions, you must delete an existing version using  DeletePolicyVersion before you create a new version.

     

    Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default version. The default version is the version that is in effect for the IAM users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached.

     

    For more information about managed policy versions, see `Versioning for managed policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

          SetAsDefault=True|False
      )
    :type PolicyArn: string
    :param PolicyArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy to which you want to add a new version.

       

      For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      

    
    :type PolicyDocument: string
    :param PolicyDocument: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The JSON policy document that you want to use as the content for this new version of the policy.

       

      You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

       

      The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see `IAM and STS character quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length>`__ .

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

       

       
      * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range 
       
      * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF`` ) 
       
      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) 
       

      

    
    :type SetAsDefault: boolean
    :param SetAsDefault: 

      Specifies whether to set this version as the policy's default version.

       

      When this parameter is ``true`` , the new policy version becomes the operative version. That is, it becomes the version that is in effect for the IAM users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to.

       

      For more information about managed policy versions, see `Versioning for managed policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        Contains the response to a successful  CreatePolicyVersion request. 

        
        

        - **PolicyVersion** *(dict) --* 

          A structure containing details about the new policy version.

          
          

          - **Document** *(string) --* 

            The policy document.

             

            The policy document is returned in the response to the  GetPolicyVersion and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. It is not returned in the response to the  CreatePolicyVersion or  ListPolicyVersions operations. 

             

            The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

            
          

          - **VersionId** *(string) --* 

            The identifier for the policy version.

             

            Policy version identifiers always begin with ``v`` (always lowercase). When a policy is created, the first policy version is ``v1`` . 

            
          

          - **IsDefaultVersion** *(boolean) --* 

            Specifies whether the policy version is set as the policy's default version.

              },
          ]
      )
    :type Path: string
    :param Path: 

      The path to the role. For more information about paths, see `IAM Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

       

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).

       

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (``\u0021`` ) through the DEL character (``\u007F`` ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

      

    
    :type RoleName: string
    :param RoleName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the role to create.

       

      IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

      

    
    :type AssumeRolePolicyDocument: string
    :param AssumeRolePolicyDocument: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The trust relationship policy document that grants an entity permission to assume the role.

       

      In IAM, you must provide a JSON policy that has been converted to a string. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

       

       
      * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range 
       
      * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF`` ) 
       
      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) 
       

       

      Upon success, the response includes the same trust policy in JSON format.

      

    
    :type Description: string
    :param Description: 

      A description of the role.

      

    
    :type MaxSessionDuration: integer
    :param MaxSessionDuration: 

      The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for the specified role. If you do not specify a value for this setting, the default maximum of one hour is applied. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

       

      Anyone who assumes the role from the or API can use the ``DurationSeconds`` API parameter or the ``duration-seconds`` CLI parameter to request a longer session. The ``MaxSessionDuration`` setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using the ``DurationSeconds`` parameter. If users don't specify a value for the ``DurationSeconds`` parameter, their security credentials are valid for one hour by default. This applies when you use the ``AssumeRole*`` API operations or the ``assume-role*`` CLI operations but does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see `Using IAM roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      

    
    :type PermissionsBoundary: string
    :param PermissionsBoundary: 

      The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the role.

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      A list of tags that you want to attach to the new role. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

       

      .. note::

         

        If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.

         

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

           

          .. note::

             

            Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

  .. py:method:: create_saml_provider(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an IAM resource that describes an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML 2.0.

     

    The SAML provider resource that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in an IAM role's trust policy. Such a policy can enable federated users who sign in using the SAML IdP to assume the role. You can create an IAM role that supports Web-based single sign-on (SSO) to the Management Console or one that supports API access to Amazon Web Services.

     

    When you create the SAML provider resource, you upload a SAML metadata document that you get from your IdP. That document includes the issuer's name, expiration information, and keys that can be used to validate the SAML authentication response (assertions) that the IdP sends. You must generate the metadata document using the identity management software that is used as your organization's IdP.

     

    .. note::

       

      This operation requires `Signature Version 4 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__ .

       

     

    For more information, see `Enabling SAML 2.0 federated users to access the Management Console <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html>`__ and `About SAML 2.0-based federation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

  .. py:method:: create_service_linked_role(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific Amazon Web Services service. The service controls the attached policies and when the role can be deleted. This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your Amazon Web Services resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to control the role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when a service and its role are no longer needed. For more information, see `Using service-linked roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . 

     

    To attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make the request using the Amazon Web Services service that depends on this role.

    

    See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/iam-2010-05-08/CreateServiceLinkedRole>`_

    :param Description: 

      The description of the role.

      

    
    :type CustomSuffix: string
    :param CustomSuffix: 

      

       

      A string that you provide, which is combined with the service-provided prefix to form the complete role name. If you make multiple requests for the same service, then you must supply a different ``CustomSuffix`` for each request. Otherwise the request fails with a duplicate role name error. For example, you could add ``-1`` or ``-debug`` to the suffix.

       

      Some services do not support the ``CustomSuffix`` parameter. If you provide an optional suffix and the operation fails, try the operation again without the suffix.

  .. py:method:: create_service_specific_credential(**kwargs)

    

    Generates a set of credentials consisting of a user name and password that can be used to access the service specified in the request. These credentials are generated by IAM, and can be used only for the specified service. 

     

    You can have a maximum of two sets of service-specific credentials for each supported service per user.

     

    You can create service-specific credentials for CodeCommit and Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra).

     

    You can reset the password to a new service-generated value by calling  ResetServiceSpecificCredential .

     

    For more information about service-specific credentials, see `Using IAM with CodeCommit\: Git credentials, SSH keys, and Amazon Web Services access keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

           

          .. note::

             

            Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

            The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide* . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

             

             
            * The user never had a password. 
             
            * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. 
             

             

            A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

             

            This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations.

            - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --* 

              The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy`` .

              
            

            - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --* 

              The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

          - **User** *(dict) --* 

            The IAM user associated with this virtual MFA device.

            
            

            - **Path** *(string) --* 

              The path to the user. For more information about paths, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

               

              The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

            - **Arn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see `IAM Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . 

              
            

            - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --*

            - **PasswordLastUsed** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide* . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

               

               
              * The user never had a password. 
               
              * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. 
               

               

              A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

               

              This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations. 

              
            

            - **PermissionsBoundary** *(dict) --* 

              For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

              
              

              - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --* 

                The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy`` .

                
              

              - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --* 

                The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

              A list of tags that are associated with the user. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

  .. py:method:: delete_access_key(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the access key pair associated with the specified IAM user.

     

    If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.

  .. py:method:: delete_login_profile(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the password for the specified IAM user, which terminates the user's ability to access Amazon Web Services services through the Management Console.

     

    You can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the **Users** page in the IAM console to delete a password for any IAM user. You can use  ChangePassword to update, but not delete, your own password in the **My Security Credentials** page in the Management Console.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Deleting a user's password does not prevent a user from accessing Amazon Web Services through the command line interface or the API. To prevent all user access, you must also either make any access keys inactive or delete them. For more information about making keys inactive or deleting them, see  UpdateAccessKey and  DeleteAccessKey .

  .. py:method:: delete_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the specified managed policy.

     

    Before you can delete a managed policy, you must first detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that it is attached to. In addition, you must delete all the policy's versions. The following steps describe the process for deleting a managed policy:

     

     
    * Detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to, using  DetachUserPolicy ,  DetachGroupPolicy , or  DetachRolePolicy . To list all the users, groups, and roles that a policy is attached to, use  ListEntitiesForPolicy . 
     
    * Delete all versions of the policy using  DeletePolicyVersion . To list the policy's versions, use  ListPolicyVersions . You cannot use  DeletePolicyVersion to delete the version that is marked as the default version. You delete the policy's default version in the next step of the process. 
     
    * Delete the policy (this automatically deletes the policy's default version) using this operation.

  .. py:method:: delete_service_linked_role(**kwargs)

    

    Submits a service-linked role deletion request and returns a ``DeletionTaskId`` , which you can use to check the status of the deletion. Before you call this operation, confirm that the role has no active sessions and that any resources used by the role in the linked service are deleted. If you call this operation more than once for the same service-linked role and an earlier deletion task is not complete, then the ``DeletionTaskId`` of the earlier request is returned.

     

    If you submit a deletion request for a service-linked role whose linked service is still accessing a resource, then the deletion task fails. If it fails, the  GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus operation returns the reason for the failure, usually including the resources that must be deleted. To delete the service-linked role, you must first remove those resources from the linked service and then submit the deletion request again. Resources are specific to the service that is linked to the role. For more information about removing resources from a service, see the `Amazon Web Services documentation <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/>`__ for your service.

    If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated IAM users.

    You can generate a service last accessed data report for entities by specifying only the entity's path. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by any service control policies (SCPs) that apply to the entity.

     

    You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by specifying an entity's path and an optional Organizations policy ID. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by the specified SCP.

     

    For each service in both report types, the data includes the most recent account activity that the policy allows to account principals in the entity or the entity's children. For important information about the data, reporting period, permissions required, troubleshooting, and supported Regions see `Reducing permissions using service last accessed data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      The data includes all attempts to access Amazon Web Services, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the Management Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that an account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access.

    This operation returns a ``JobId`` . Use this parameter in the ``  GetOrganizationsAccessReport `` operation to check the status of the report generation. To check the status of this request, use the ``JobId`` parameter in the ``  GetOrganizationsAccessReport `` operation and test the ``JobStatus`` response parameter. When the job is complete, you can retrieve the report.

     

    To generate a service last accessed data report for entities, specify an entity path without specifying the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned in the report.

     

     
    * **Root** – When you specify the organizations root as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to your root. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization except the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. 
     
    * **OU** – When you specify an organizational unit (OU) as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the OU and its parents. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children. This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. 
     
    * **management account** – When you specify the management account, the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. For each service, the report includes data for only the management account. 
     
    * **Account** – When you specify another account as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the account and its parents. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified account. 
     

     

    To generate a service last accessed data report for policies, specify an entity path and the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned for each service.

     

     
    * **Root** – When you specify the root entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization to which the SCP applies. This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to any entities in the organization, then the report will return a list of services with no data. 
     
    * **OU** – When you specify an OU entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children to which the SCP applies. This means that other accounts outside the OU that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to the OU or one of its children, the report will return a list of services with no data. 
     
    * **management account** – When you specify the management account, the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a policy ID in the CLI or API, the policy is ignored. For each service, the report includes data for only the management account. 
     
    * **Account** – When you specify another account entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified account. This means that other accounts in the organization that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. If the SCP is not attached to the account, the report will return a list of services with no data. 
     

     

    .. note::

       

      Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a principal could access a service. These other policy types include identity-based policies, resource-based policies, access control lists, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies SCP logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see `Evaluating policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

                  The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

                  The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

                  The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the policy version was created.

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

  .. py:method:: get_context_keys_for_custom_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Gets a list of all of the context keys referenced in the input policies. The policies are supplied as a list of one or more strings. To get the context keys from policies associated with an IAM user, group, or role, use  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

     

    Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. Context keys can be evaluated by testing against a value specified in an IAM policy. Use ``GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy`` to understand what key names and values you must supply when you call  SimulateCustomPolicy . Note that all parameters are shown in unencoded form here for clarity but must be URL encoded to be included as a part of a real HTML request.

  .. py:method:: get_context_keys_for_principal_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Gets a list of all of the context keys referenced in all the IAM policies that are attached to the specified IAM entity. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role. If you specify a user, then the request also includes all of the policies attached to groups that the user is a member of.

     

    You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies, specified as strings. If you want to include *only* a list of policies by string, use  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy instead.

     

     **Note:** This operation discloses information about the permissions granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user's permissions, then consider allowing them to use  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy instead.

     

    Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. Context keys can be evaluated by testing against a value in an IAM policy. Use  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy to understand what key names and values you must supply when you call  SimulatePrincipalPolicy .

      The name of the group.

       

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide* . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

               

               
              * The user never had a password. 
               
              * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. 
               

               

              A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

               

              This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations. 

              
            

            - **PermissionsBoundary** *(dict) --* 

              For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

              
              

              - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --* 

                The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy`` .

                
              

              - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --* 

                The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

                A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

                     

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

  .. py:method:: get_group_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves the specified inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM group.

     

    .. note::

       

      Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

       

     

    An IAM group can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve a managed policy document that is attached to a group, use  GetPolicy to determine the policy's default version, then use  GetPolicyVersion to retrieve the policy document.

     

    For more information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

  .. py:method:: get_login_profile(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves the user name for the specified IAM user. A login profile is created when you create a password for the user to access the Management Console. If the user does not exist or does not have a password, the operation returns a 404 (``NoSuchEntity`` ) error.

     

    If you create an IAM user with access to the console, the ``CreateDate`` reflects the date you created the initial password for the user.

     

    If you create an IAM user with programmatic access, and then later add a password for the user to access the Management Console, the ``CreateDate`` reflects the initial password creation date. A user with programmatic access does not have a login profile unless you create a password for the user to access the Management Console.

          - *(string) --* 

            Contains a thumbprint for an identity provider's server certificate.

             

            The identity provider's server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the self-signed X.509 certificate. This thumbprint is used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. The thumbprint is always a 40-character string.

            
      
        

        - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time when the IAM OIDC provider resource object was created in the account.

          
        

        - **Tags** *(list) --* 

          A list of tags that are attached to the specified IAM OIDC provider. The returned list of tags is sorted by tag key. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

               

              .. note::

                 

                Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

  .. py:method:: get_organizations_access_report(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves the service last accessed data report for Organizations that was previously generated using the ``  GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport `` operation. This operation retrieves the status of your report job and the report contents.

     

    Depending on the parameters that you passed when you generated the report, the data returned could include different information. For details, see  GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport .

     

    To call this operation, you must be signed in to the management account in your organization. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have permissions to perform this operation. For more information, see `Refining permissions using service last accessed data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    For each service that principals in an account (root users, IAM users, or IAM roles) could access using SCPs, the operation returns details about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, it returns the reason that it failed.

     

    By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.

      The identifier of the request generated by the  GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport operation.

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

      

    
    :type SortKey: string
    :param SortKey: 

      The key that is used to sort the results. If you choose the namespace key, the results are returned in alphabetical order. If you choose the time key, the results are sorted numerically by the date and time.

            The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the policy was last updated.

             

            When a policy has only one version, this field contains the date and time when the policy was created. When a policy has more than one version, this field contains the date and time when the most recent policy version was created.

            
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            A list of tags that are attached to the instance profile. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

  .. py:method:: get_policy_version(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves information about the specified version of the specified managed policy, including the policy document.

     

    .. note::

       

      Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

       

     

    To list the available versions for a policy, use  ListPolicyVersions .

     

    This operation retrieves information about managed policies. To retrieve information about an inline policy that is embedded in a user, group, or role, use  GetUserPolicy ,  GetGroupPolicy , or  GetRolePolicy .

     

    For more information about the types of policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

    Retrieves the specified inline policy document that is embedded with the specified IAM role.

     

    .. note::

       

      Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ .

  .. py:method:: get_service_last_accessed_details(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves a service last accessed report that was created using the ``GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails`` operation. You can use the ``JobId`` parameter in ``GetServiceLastAccessedDetails`` to retrieve the status of your report job. When the report is complete, you can retrieve the generated report. The report includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that the resource (user, group, role, or managed policy) can access.

     

    .. note::

       

      Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see `Evaluating policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

       

     

    For each service that the resource could access using permissions policies, the operation returns details about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, the ``GetServiceLastAccessedDetails`` operation returns the reason that it failed.

     

    The ``GetServiceLastAccessedDetails`` operation returns a list of services. This list includes the number of entities that have attempted to access the service and the date and time of the last attempt. It also returns the ARN of the following entity, depending on the resource ARN that you used to generate the report:

     

     
    * **User** – Returns the user ARN that you used to generate the report 
     
    * **Group** – Returns the ARN of the group member (user) that last attempted to access the service 
     
    * **Role** – Returns the role ARN that you used to generate the report 
     
    * **Policy** – Returns the ARN of the user or role that last used the policy to attempt to access the service 
     

     

    By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.

     

    If you specified ``ACTION_LEVEL`` granularity when you generated the report, this operation returns service and action last accessed data. This includes the most recent access attempt for each tracked action within a service. Otherwise, this operation returns only service data.

     

    For more information about service and action last accessed data, see `Reducing permissions using service last accessed data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

    :param JobId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ID of the request generated by the  GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation. The ``JobId`` returned by ``GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail`` must be used by the same role within a session, or by the same user when used to call ``GetServiceLastAccessedDetail`` .

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

                - **ActionName** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the tracked action to which access was attempted. Tracked actions are actions that report activity to IAM.

                  
                

                - **LastAccessedEntity** *(string) --* 

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique identifiers for Amazon Web Services resources.

          The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the generated report job was completed or failed.

           

          This field is null if the job is still in progress, as indicated by a job status value of ``IN_PROGRESS`` .

          
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

          
        

        - **Error** *(dict) --* 

          An object that contains details about the reason the operation failed.

  .. py:method:: get_service_last_accessed_details_with_entities(**kwargs)

    

    After you generate a group or policy report using the ``GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails`` operation, you can use the ``JobId`` parameter in ``GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities`` . This operation retrieves the status of your report job and a list of entities that could have used group or policy permissions to access the specified service.

     

     
    * **Group** – For a group report, this operation returns a list of users in the group that could have used the group’s policies in an attempt to access the service. 
     
    * **Policy** – For a policy report, this operation returns a list of entities (users or roles) that could have used the policy in an attempt to access the service. 
     

     

    You can also use this operation for user or role reports to retrieve details about those entities.

     

    If the operation fails, the ``GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities`` operation returns the reason that it failed.

     

    By default, the list of associated entities is sorted by date, with the most recent access listed first.

          ServiceNamespace='string',
          MaxItems=123,
          Marker='string'
      )
    :type JobId: string
    :param JobId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ID of the request generated by the ``GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails`` operation.

      

    
    :type ServiceNamespace: string
    :param ServiceNamespace: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The service namespace for an Amazon Web Services service. Provide the service namespace to learn when the IAM entity last attempted to access the specified service.

       

      To learn the service namespace for a service, see `Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . Choose the name of the service to view details for that service. In the first paragraph, find the service prefix. For example, ``(service prefix: a4b)`` . For more information about service namespaces, see `Amazon Web Services service namespaces <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

  .. py:method:: get_user(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves information about the specified IAM user, including the user's creation date, path, unique ID, and ARN.

     

    If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request to this operation.

            Due to a service issue, password last used data does not include password use from May 3, 2018 22:50 PDT to May 23, 2018 14:08 PDT. This affects `last sign-in <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_finding-unused.html>`__ dates shown in the IAM console and password last used dates in the `IAM credential report <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_getting-report.html>`__ , and returned by this operation. If users signed in during the affected time, the password last used date that is returned is the date the user last signed in before May 3, 2018. For users that signed in after May 23, 2018 14:08 PDT, the returned password last used date is accurate.

             

            You can use password last used information to identify unused credentials for deletion. For example, you might delete users who did not sign in to Amazon Web Services in the last 90 days. In cases like this, we recommend that you adjust your evaluation window to include dates after May 23, 2018. Alternatively, if your users use access keys to access Amazon Web Services programmatically you can refer to access key last used information because it is accurate for all dates. 

             

          
          

          - **Path** *(string) --* 

            The path to the user. For more information about paths, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

             

            The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

            
          

          - **UserName** *(string) --* 

            The friendly name identifying the user.

            
          

          - **UserId** *(string) --* 

            The stable and unique string identifying the user. For more information about IDs, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

            
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see `IAM Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . 

            
          

          - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user was created.

            
          

          - **PasswordLastUsed** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide* . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

             

             
            * The user never had a password. 
             
            * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. 
             

             

            A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

             

            This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations. 

            
          

          - **PermissionsBoundary** *(dict) --* 

            For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

            
            

            - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --* 

              The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy`` .

              
            

            - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --* 

              The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

              
        
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            A list of tags that are associated with the user. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                 

                .. note::

                   

                  Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

  .. py:method:: get_user_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves the specified inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM user.

     

    .. note::

       

      Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

       

     

    An IAM user can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve a managed policy document that is attached to a user, use  GetPolicy to determine the policy's default version. Then use  GetPolicyVersion to retrieve the policy document.

     

    For more information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

  .. py:method:: list_access_keys(**kwargs)

    

    Returns information about the access key IDs associated with the specified IAM user. If there is none, the operation returns an empty list.

     

    Although each user is limited to a small number of keys, you can still paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

     

    If the ``UserName`` field is not specified, the user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.

     

    .. note::

       

      To ensure the security of your account, the secret access key is accessible only during key and user creation.

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

    Lists all managed policies that are attached to the specified IAM group.

     

    An IAM group can also have inline policies embedded with it. To list the inline policies for a group, use  ListGroupPolicies . For information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters. You can use the ``PathPrefix`` parameter to limit the list of policies to only those matching the specified path prefix. If there are no policies attached to the specified group (or none that match the specified path prefix), the operation returns an empty list.

If it is not included, all attached entities (users, groups, and roles) are returned. The argument for this parameter must be one of the valid values listed below.

      

    
    :type PathPrefix: string
    :param PathPrefix: 

      The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all entities.

       

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (``\u0021`` ) through the DEL character (``\u007F`` ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

      

    
    :type PolicyUsageFilter: string
    :param PolicyUsageFilter: 

      The policy usage method to use for filtering the results.

       

      To list only permissions policies, set ``PolicyUsageFilter`` to ``PermissionsPolicy`` . To list only the policies used to set permissions boundaries, set the value to ``PermissionsBoundary`` .

       

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies are returned. 

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

          The list of tags that are currently attached to the IAM instance profile. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. If no tags are attached to the specified resource, the response contains an empty list.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

               

              .. note::

                 

                Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

  .. py:method:: list_instance_profiles(**kwargs)

    

    Lists the instance profiles that have the specified path prefix. If there are none, the operation returns an empty list. For more information about instance profiles, see `About instance profiles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AboutInstanceProfiles.html>`__ .

     

    .. note::

       

      IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the information for an instance profile, see  GetInstanceProfile .

       

     

    You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

    :param PathPrefix: 

      The path prefix for filtering the results. For example, the prefix ``/application_abc/component_xyz/`` gets all instance profiles whose path starts with ``/application_abc/component_xyz/`` .

       

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all instance profiles.

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

          
    
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`IAM.Client.exceptions.ServiceFailureException`

    

  .. py:method:: list_instance_profiles_for_role(**kwargs)

    

    Lists the instance profiles that have the specified associated IAM role. If there are none, the operation returns an empty list. For more information about instance profiles, go to `About instance profiles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AboutInstanceProfiles.html>`__ .

     

    You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.list_instance_profiles_for_role(
          RoleName='string',
          Marker='string',
          MaxItems=123
      )
    :type RoleName: string
    :param RoleName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the role to list instance profiles for.

       

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

  .. py:method:: list_policies(**kwargs)

    

    Lists all the managed policies that are available in your account, including your own customer-defined managed policies and all Amazon Web Services managed policies.

     

    You can filter the list of policies that is returned using the optional ``OnlyAttached`` , ``Scope`` , and ``PathPrefix`` parameters. For example, to list only the customer managed policies in your Amazon Web Services account, set ``Scope`` to ``Local`` . To list only Amazon Web Services managed policies, set ``Scope`` to ``AWS`` .

     

    You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

     

    For more information about managed policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

      IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the information for a customer manged policy, see  GetPolicy .

          MaxItems=123
      )
    :type Scope: string
    :param Scope: 

      The scope to use for filtering the results.

       

      To list only Amazon Web Services managed policies, set ``Scope`` to ``AWS`` . To list only the customer managed policies in your account, set ``Scope`` to ``Local`` .

       

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, or if it is set to ``All`` , all policies are returned.

      

    
    :type OnlyAttached: boolean
    :param OnlyAttached: 

      A flag to filter the results to only the attached policies.

       

      When ``OnlyAttached`` is ``true`` , the returned list contains only the policies that are attached to an IAM user, group, or role. When ``OnlyAttached`` is ``false`` , or when the parameter is not included, all policies are returned.

      

    
    :type PathPrefix: string
    :param PathPrefix: 

      The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all policies. This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (``\u0021`` ) through the DEL character (``\u007F`` ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

      

    
    :type PolicyUsageFilter: string
    :param PolicyUsageFilter: 

      The policy usage method to use for filtering the results.

       

      To list only permissions policies, set ``PolicyUsageFilter`` to ``PermissionsPolicy`` . To list only the policies used to set permissions boundaries, set the value to ``PermissionsBoundary`` .

       

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies are returned. 

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

                     

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

  .. py:method:: list_policies_granting_service_access(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves a list of policies that the IAM identity (user, group, or role) can use to access each specified service.

     

    .. note::

       

      This operation does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see `Evaluating policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

       

     

    The list of policies returned by the operation depends on the ARN of the identity that you provide.

     

     
    * **User** – The list of policies includes the managed and inline policies that are attached to the user directly. The list also includes any additional managed and inline policies that are attached to the group to which the user belongs.  
     
    * **Group** – The list of policies includes only the managed and inline policies that are attached to the group directly. Policies that are attached to the group’s user are not included. 
     
    * **Role** – The list of policies includes only the managed and inline policies that are attached to the role. 
     

     

    For each managed policy, this operation returns the ARN and policy name. For each inline policy, it returns the policy name and the entity to which it is attached. Inline policies do not have an ARN. For more information about these policy types, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    Policies that are attached to users and roles as permissions boundaries are not returned. To view which managed policy is currently used to set the permissions boundary for a user or role, use the  GetUser or  GetRole operations.

                  For more information about ARNs, go to `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* . 

                  
                

                - **EntityType** *(string) --* 

                  The type of entity (user or role) that used the policy to access the service to which the inline policy is attached.

                   

                  This field is null for managed policies. For more information about these policy types, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

          - *(dict) --* 

            Contains information about a version of a managed policy.

             

            This data type is used as a response element in the  CreatePolicyVersion ,  GetPolicyVersion ,  ListPolicyVersions , and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. 

             

            For more information about managed policies, refer to `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . 

            
            

            - **Document** *(string) --* 

              The policy document.

               

              The policy document is returned in the response to the  GetPolicyVersion and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. It is not returned in the response to the  CreatePolicyVersion or  ListPolicyVersions operations. 

               

              The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

              
            

            - **VersionId** *(string) --* 

              The identifier for the policy version.

               

              Policy version identifiers always begin with ``v`` (always lowercase). When a policy is created, the first policy version is ``v1`` . 

              
            

            - **IsDefaultVersion** *(boolean) --*

  .. py:method:: list_role_policies(**kwargs)

    

    Lists the names of the inline policies that are embedded in the specified IAM role.

     

    An IAM role can also have managed policies attached to it. To list the managed policies that are attached to a role, use  ListAttachedRolePolicies . For more information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters. If there are no inline policies embedded with the specified role, the operation returns an empty list.

  .. py:method:: list_roles(**kwargs)

    

    Lists the IAM roles that have the specified path prefix. If there are none, the operation returns an empty list. For more information about roles, see `Working with roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html>`__ .

     

    .. note::

       

      IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the information for a role, see  GetRole .

       

     

    You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.list_roles(
          PathPrefix='string',
          Marker='string',
          MaxItems=123
      )
    :type PathPrefix: string
    :param PathPrefix: 

      The path prefix for filtering the results. For example, the prefix ``/application_abc/component_xyz/`` gets all roles whose path starts with ``/application_abc/component_xyz/`` .

       

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all roles. This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (``\u0021`` ) through the DEL character (``\u007F`` ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

                  The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

                The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ that the role was last used.

                 

                This field is null if the role has not been used within the IAM tracking period. For more information about the tracking period, see `Regions where data is tracked <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#access-advisor_tracking-period>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

        - **Tags** *(list) --* 

          The list of tags that are currently attached to the IAM server certificate. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. If no tags are attached to the specified resource, the response contains an empty list.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

               

              .. note::

                 

                Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

                 

              
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

  .. py:method:: list_server_certificates(**kwargs)

    

    Lists the server certificates stored in IAM that have the specified path prefix. If none exist, the operation returns an empty list.

     

    You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

     

    For more information about working with server certificates, see `Working with server certificates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . This topic also includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.

     

    .. note::

       

      IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the information for a servercertificate, see  GetServerCertificate .

    Returns information about the signing certificates associated with the specified IAM user. If none exists, the operation returns an empty list.

     

    Although each user is limited to a small number of signing certificates, you can still paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

     

    If the ``UserName`` field is not specified, the user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request for this operation. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.

      )
    :type UserName: string
    :param UserName: 

      The name of the IAM user to list SSH public keys for. If none is specified, the ``UserName`` field is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key used to sign the request.

       

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

              The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company.

    Lists the IAM users that have the specified path prefix. If no path prefix is specified, the operation returns all users in the account. If there are none, the operation returns an empty list.

     

    .. note::

       

      IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the information for a user, see  GetUser .

            - **Path** *(string) --* 

              The path to the user. For more information about paths, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

               

              The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide* . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

               

               
              * The user never had a password. 
               
              * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. 
               

               

              A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

               

              This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations.

              - *(dict) --* 

                A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

                     

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

  .. py:method:: list_virtual_mfa_devices(**kwargs)

    

    Lists the virtual MFA devices defined in the account by assignment status. If you do not specify an assignment status, the operation returns a list of all virtual MFA devices. Assignment status can be ``Assigned`` , ``Unassigned`` , or ``Any`` .

     

    .. note::

       

      IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the information for a virtual MFA device, see  ListVirtualMFADevices .

       

     

    You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.list_virtual_mfa_devices(
          AssignmentStatus='Assigned'|'Unassigned'|'Any',
          Marker='string',
          MaxItems=123
      )
    :type AssignmentStatus: string
    :param AssignmentStatus: 

      The status (``Unassigned`` or ``Assigned`` ) of the devices to list. If you do not specify an ``AssignmentStatus`` , the operation defaults to ``Any`` , which lists both assigned and unassigned virtual MFA devices.,

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

The ``Base32String`` value is base64-encoded. 

              
            

            - **User** *(dict) --* 

              The IAM user associated with this virtual MFA device.

              
              

              - **Path** *(string) --* 

                The path to the user. For more information about paths, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                 

                The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

                
              

              - **UserName** *(string) --* 

                The friendly name identifying the user.

                
              

              - **UserId** *(string) --* 

                The stable and unique string identifying the user. For more information about IDs, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                
              

              - **Arn** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see `IAM Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . 

                
              

              - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

                The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user was created.

                
              

              - **PasswordLastUsed** *(datetime) --* 

                The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide* . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

                 

                 
                * The user never had a password. 
                 
                * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. 
                 

                 

                A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

                 

                This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations. 

                
              

              - **PermissionsBoundary** *(dict) --* 

                For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                
                

                - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --* 

                  The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy`` .

                  
                

                - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --* 

                  The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

                  
            
              

              - **Tags** *(list) --*

                    The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

                    
                  

                  - **Value** *(string) --* 

                    The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company.

  .. py:method:: put_group_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM group.

     

    A user can also have managed policies attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a group, use  AttachGroupPolicy . To create a new managed policy, use  CreatePolicy . For information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed in a group, see `IAM and STS quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

    Adds or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM role's permissions boundary. You can use an Amazon Web Services managed policy or a customer managed policy to set the boundary for a role. Use the boundary to control the maximum permissions that the role can have. Setting a permissions boundary is an advanced feature that can affect the permissions for the role.

     

    You cannot set the boundary for a service-linked role. 

     

    .. warning::

       

      Policies used as permissions boundaries do not provide permissions. You must also attach a permissions policy to the role. To learn how the effective permissions for a role are evaluated, see `IAM JSON policy evaluation logic <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html>`__ in the IAM User Guide.

  .. py:method:: put_role_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM role.

     

    When you embed an inline policy in a role, the inline policy is used as part of the role's access (permissions) policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using  CreateRole . You can update a role's trust policy using  UpdateAssumeRolePolicy . For more information about IAM roles, see `Using roles to delegate permissions and federate identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html>`__ .

     

    A role can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a role, use  AttachRolePolicy . To create a new managed policy, use  CreatePolicy . For information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

  .. py:method:: set_security_token_service_preferences(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the specified version of the global endpoint token as the token version used for the account.

     

    By default, Security Token Service (STS) is available as a global service, and all STS requests go to a single endpoint at ``https://sts.amazonaws.com`` . Amazon Web Services recommends using Regional STS endpoints to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase session token availability. For information about Regional endpoints for STS, see `Security Token Service endpoints and quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sts.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

     

    If you make an STS call to the global endpoint, the resulting session tokens might be valid in some Regions but not others. It depends on the version that is set in this operation. Version 1 tokens are valid only in Regions that are available by default. These tokens do not work in manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong). Version 2 tokens are valid in all Regions. However, version 2 tokens are longer and might affect systems where you temporarily store tokens. For information, see `Activating and deactivating STS in an Region <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    To view the current session token version, see the ``GlobalEndpointTokenVersion`` entry in the response of the  GetAccountSummary operation.

  .. py:method:: simulate_custom_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Simulate how a set of IAM policies and optionally a resource-based policy works with a list of API operations and Amazon Web Services resources to determine the policies' effective permissions. The policies are provided as strings.

     

    The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the operations. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.

     

    If you want to simulate existing policies that are attached to an IAM user, group, or role, use  SimulatePrincipalPolicy instead.

     

    Context keys are variables that are maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services and which provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the ``Condition`` element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy .

     

    If the output is long, you can use ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters to paginate the results.

      A list of policy documents to include in the simulation. Each document is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of an IAM policy. Do not include any resource-based policies in this parameter. Any resource-based policy must be submitted with the ``ResourcePolicy`` parameter. The policies cannot be "scope-down" policies, such as you could include in a call to `GetFederationToken <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetFederationToken.html>`__ or one of the `AssumeRole <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html>`__ API operations. In other words, do not use policies designed to restrict what a user can do while using the temporary credentials.

       

      The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see `IAM and STS character quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length>`__ .

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

       

       
      * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range 
       
      * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF`` ) 
       
      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) 
       

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type PermissionsBoundaryPolicyInputList: list
    :param PermissionsBoundaryPolicyInputList: 

      The IAM permissions boundary policy to simulate. The permissions boundary sets the maximum permissions that an IAM entity can have. You can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM entities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . The policy input is specified as a string that contains the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy.

      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ActionNames: list
    :param ActionNames: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A list of names of API operations to evaluate in the simulation. Each operation is evaluated against each resource. Each operation must include the service identifier, such as ``iam:CreateUser`` . This operation does not support using wildcards (*) in an action name.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ResourceArns: list
    :param ResourceArns: 

      A list of ARNs of Amazon Web Services resources to include in the simulation. If this parameter is not provided, then the value defaults to ``*`` (all resources). Each API in the ``ActionNames`` parameter is evaluated for each resource in this list. The simulation determines the access result (allowed or denied) of each combination and reports it in the response. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.

       

      The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the ``ResourcePolicy`` parameter.

       

      If you include a ``ResourcePolicy`` , then it must be applicable to all of the resources included in the simulation or you receive an invalid input error.

       

      For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ResourcePolicy: string
    :param ResourcePolicy: 

      A resource-based policy to include in the simulation provided as a string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this policy attached. You can include only one resource-based policy in a simulation.

       

      The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see `IAM and STS character quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length>`__ .

    :type ResourceOwner: string
    :param ResourceOwner: 

      An ARN representing the account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If ``ResourceOwner`` is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any ``ResourcePolicy`` included in the simulation. If the ``ResourceOwner`` parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in ``CallerArn`` . This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user ``CallerArn`` .

       

      The ARN for an account uses the following syntax: ``arn:aws:iam::*AWS-account-ID* :root`` . For example, to represent the account with the 112233445566 ID, use the following ARN: ``arn:aws:iam::112233445566-ID:root`` . 

      

    
    :type CallerArn: string
    :param CallerArn: 

      The ARN of the IAM user that you want to use as the simulated caller of the API operations. ``CallerArn`` is required if you include a ``ResourcePolicy`` so that the policy's ``Principal`` element has a value to use in evaluating the policy.

       

      You can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.

      

    
    :type ContextEntries: list
    :param ContextEntries: 

      A list of context keys and corresponding values for the simulation to use. Whenever a context key is evaluated in one of the simulated IAM permissions policies, the corresponding value is supplied.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Contains information about a condition context key. It includes the name of the key and specifies the value (or values, if the context key supports multiple values) to use in the simulation. This information is used when evaluating the ``Condition`` elements of the input policies.

         

        This data type is used as an input parameter to  SimulateCustomPolicy and  SimulatePrincipalPolicy .

        

      
        - **ContextKeyName** *(string) --* 

          The full name of a condition context key, including the service prefix. For example, ``aws:SourceIp`` or ``s3:VersionId`` .

          

        
        - **ContextKeyValues** *(list) --* 

          The value (or values, if the condition context key supports multiple values) to provide to the simulation when the key is referenced by a ``Condition`` element in an input policy.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
        - **ContextKeyType** *(string) --* 

          The data type of the value (or values) specified in the ``ContextKeyValues`` parameter.

          

        
      
  
    :type ResourceHandlingOption: string
    :param ResourceHandlingOption: 

      Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that support resource-based policies require different combinations of resources. By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation.

       

      Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security-group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network-interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the EC2 scenario options, see `Supported platforms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* .

       

       
      * **EC2-Classic-InstanceStore**   instance, image, security-group 
       
      * **EC2-Classic-EBS**   instance, image, security-group, volume 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-InstanceStore**   instance, image, security-group, network-interface 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-InstanceStore-Subnet**   instance, image, security-group, network-interface, subnet 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-EBS**   instance, image, security-group, network-interface, volume 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-EBS-Subnet**   instance, image, security-group, network-interface, subnet, volume 
       

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

            - **MissingContextValues** *(list) --* 

              A list of context keys that are required by the included input policies but that were not provided by one of the input parameters. This list is used when the resource in a simulation is "*", either explicitly, or when the ``ResourceArns`` parameter blank. If you include a list of resources, then any missing context values are instead included under the ``ResourceSpecificResults`` section. To discover the context keys used by a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
            

            - **OrganizationsDecisionDetail** *(dict) --* 

              A structure that details how Organizations and its service control policies affect the results of the simulation. Only applies if the simulated user's account is part of an organization.

              
              

              - **AllowedByOrganizations** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether the simulated operation is allowed by the Organizations service control policies that impact the simulated user's account.

                
          
            

            - **PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail** *(dict) --* 

              Contains information about the effect that a permissions boundary has on a policy simulation when the boundary is applied to an IAM entity.

              
              

              - **AllowedByPermissionsBoundary** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether an action is allowed by a permissions boundary that is applied to an IAM entity (user or role). A value of ``true`` means that the permissions boundary does not deny the action. This means that the policy includes an ``Allow`` statement that matches the request. In this case, if an identity-based policy also allows the action, the request is allowed. A value of ``false`` means that either the requested action is not allowed (implicitly denied) or that the action is explicitly denied by the permissions boundary. In both of these cases, the action is not allowed, regardless of the identity-based policy.

                
          
            

            - **EvalDecisionDetails** *(dict) --* 

              Additional details about the results of the cross-account evaluation decision. This parameter is populated for only cross-account simulations. It contains a brief summary of how each policy type contributes to the final evaluation decision.

               

              If the simulation evaluates policies within the same account and includes a resource ARN, then the parameter is present but the response is empty. If the simulation evaluates policies within the same account and specifies all resources (``*`` ), then the parameter is not returned.

               

              When you make a cross-account request, Amazon Web Services evaluates the request in the trusting account and the trusted account. The request is allowed only if both evaluations return ``true`` . For more information about how policies are evaluated, see `Evaluating policies within a single account <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics>`__ .

               

              If an Organizations SCP included in the evaluation denies access, the simulation ends. In this case, policy evaluation does not proceed any further and this parameter is not returned.

              
              

              - *(string) --*

              - *(dict) --* 

                Contains the result of the simulation of a single API operation call on a single resource.

                 

                This data type is used by a member of the  EvaluationResult data type.

                
                

                - **EvalResourceName** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the simulated resource, in Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format.

                  
                

                - **EvalResourceDecision** *(string) --* 

                  The result of the simulation of the simulated API operation on the resource specified in ``EvalResourceName`` .

                  
                

                - **MatchedStatements** *(list) --* 

                  A list of the statements in the input policies that determine the result for this part of the simulation. Remember that even if multiple statements allow the operation on the resource, if *any* statement denies that operation, then the explicit deny overrides any allow. In addition, the deny statement is the only entry included in the result.

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    Contains a reference to a ``Statement`` element in a policy document that determines the result of the simulation.

                     

                    This data type is used by the ``MatchedStatements`` member of the ``  EvaluationResult `` type.

                    
                    

                    - **SourcePolicyId** *(string) --* 

                      The identifier of the policy that was provided as an input.

                - **MissingContextValues** *(list) --* 

                  A list of context keys that are required by the included input policies but that were not provided by one of the input parameters. This list is used when a list of ARNs is included in the ``ResourceArns`` parameter instead of "*". If you do not specify individual resources, by setting ``ResourceArns`` to "*" or by not including the ``ResourceArns`` parameter, then any missing context values are instead included under the ``EvaluationResults`` section. To discover the context keys used by a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

This parameter explains how each policy type contributes to the resource-specific evaluation decision.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --*

                - **PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail** *(dict) --* 

                  Contains information about the effect that a permissions boundary has on a policy simulation when that boundary is applied to an IAM entity.

                  
                  

                  - **AllowedByPermissionsBoundary** *(boolean) --* 

                    Specifies whether an action is allowed by a permissions boundary that is applied to an IAM entity (user or role). A value of ``true`` means that the permissions boundary does not deny the action. This means that the policy includes an ``Allow`` statement that matches the request. In this case, if an identity-based policy also allows the action, the request is allowed. A value of ``false`` means that either the requested action is not allowed (implicitly denied) or that the action is explicitly denied by the permissions boundary. In both of these cases, the action is not allowed, regardless of the identity-based policy.

                    
              
            
          
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

  .. py:method:: simulate_principal_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Simulate how a set of IAM policies attached to an IAM entity works with a list of API operations and Amazon Web Services resources to determine the policies' effective permissions. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role. If you specify a user, then the simulation also includes all of the policies that are attached to groups that the user belongs to. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.

     

    You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies specified as strings to include in the simulation. If you want to simulate only policies specified as strings, use  SimulateCustomPolicy instead.

     

    You can also optionally include one resource-based policy to be evaluated with each of the resources included in the simulation.

     

    The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the operations.

     

     **Note:** This operation discloses information about the permissions granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user's permissions, then consider allowing them to use  SimulateCustomPolicy instead.

     

    Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the ``Condition`` element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

     

    If the output is long, you can use the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters to paginate the results.

    :type PolicySourceArn: string
    :param PolicySourceArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a user, group, or role whose policies you want to include in the simulation. If you specify a user, group, or role, the simulation includes all policies that are associated with that entity. If you specify a user, the simulation also includes all policies that are attached to any groups the user belongs to.

       

      The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see `IAM and STS character quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length>`__ .

       

      For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      

    
    :type PolicyInputList: list
    :param PolicyInputList: 

      An optional list of additional policy documents to include in the simulation. Each document is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of an IAM policy.

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

       

       
      * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range 
       
      * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF`` ) 
       
      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) 
       

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type PermissionsBoundaryPolicyInputList: list
    :param PermissionsBoundaryPolicyInputList: 

      The IAM permissions boundary policy to simulate. The permissions boundary sets the maximum permissions that the entity can have. You can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. An IAM entity can only have one permissions boundary in effect at a time. For example, if a permissions boundary is attached to an entity and you pass in a different permissions boundary policy using this parameter, then the new permissions boundary policy is used for the simulation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM entities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . The policy input is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy.

      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ActionNames: list
    :param ActionNames: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A list of names of API operations to evaluate in the simulation. Each operation is evaluated for each resource. Each operation must include the service identifier, such as ``iam:CreateUser`` .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ResourceArns: list
    :param ResourceArns: 

      A list of ARNs of Amazon Web Services resources to include in the simulation. If this parameter is not provided, then the value defaults to ``*`` (all resources). Each API in the ``ActionNames`` parameter is evaluated for each resource in this list. The simulation determines the access result (allowed or denied) of each combination and reports it in the response. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.

       

      The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the ``ResourcePolicy`` parameter.

       

      For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ResourcePolicy: string
    :param ResourcePolicy: 

      A resource-based policy to include in the simulation provided as a string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this policy attached. You can include only one resource-based policy in a simulation.

       

      The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see `IAM and STS character quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length>`__ .

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

       

       
      * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range 
       
      * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF`` ) 
       
      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) 
       

      

    
    :type ResourceOwner: string
    :param ResourceOwner: 

      An account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If ``ResourceOwner`` is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any ``ResourcePolicy`` included in the simulation. If the ``ResourceOwner`` parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in ``CallerArn`` . This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user ``CallerArn`` .

      

    
    :type CallerArn: string
    :param CallerArn: 

      The ARN of the IAM user that you want to specify as the simulated caller of the API operations. If you do not specify a ``CallerArn`` , it defaults to the ARN of the user that you specify in ``PolicySourceArn`` , if you specified a user. If you include both a ``PolicySourceArn`` (for example, ``arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/David`` ) and a ``CallerArn`` (for example, ``arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob`` ), the result is that you simulate calling the API operations as Bob, as if Bob had David's policies.

       

      You can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.

       

       ``CallerArn`` is required if you include a ``ResourcePolicy`` and the ``PolicySourceArn`` is not the ARN for an IAM user. This is required so that the resource-based policy's ``Principal`` element has a value to use in evaluating the policy.

       

      For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      

    
    :type ContextEntries: list
    :param ContextEntries: 

      A list of context keys and corresponding values for the simulation to use. Whenever a context key is evaluated in one of the simulated IAM permissions policies, the corresponding value is supplied.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Contains information about a condition context key. It includes the name of the key and specifies the value (or values, if the context key supports multiple values) to use in the simulation. This information is used when evaluating the ``Condition`` elements of the input policies.

         

        This data type is used as an input parameter to  SimulateCustomPolicy and  SimulatePrincipalPolicy .

        

      
        - **ContextKeyName** *(string) --* 

          The full name of a condition context key, including the service prefix. For example, ``aws:SourceIp`` or ``s3:VersionId`` .

          

        
        - **ContextKeyValues** *(list) --* 

          The value (or values, if the condition context key supports multiple values) to provide to the simulation when the key is referenced by a ``Condition`` element in an input policy.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
        - **ContextKeyType** *(string) --* 

          The data type of the value (or values) specified in the ``ContextKeyValues`` parameter.

          

        
      
  
    :type ResourceHandlingOption: string
    :param ResourceHandlingOption: 

      Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that support resource-based policies require different combinations of resources. By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation.

       

      Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the EC2 scenario options, see `Supported platforms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* .

       

       
      * **EC2-Classic-InstanceStore**   instance, image, security group 
       
      * **EC2-Classic-EBS**   instance, image, security group, volume 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-InstanceStore**   instance, image, security group, network interface 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-InstanceStore-Subnet**   instance, image, security group, network interface, subnet 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-EBS**   instance, image, security group, network interface, volume 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-EBS-Subnet**   instance, image, security group, network interface, subnet, volume 
       

      

    
    :type MaxItems: integer
    :param MaxItems: 

      Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

       

      If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

                  - **Column** *(integer) --* 

                    The column in the line containing the specified position in the document.

                    
              
            
          
            

            - **MissingContextValues** *(list) --* 

              A list of context keys that are required by the included input policies but that were not provided by one of the input parameters. This list is used when the resource in a simulation is "*", either explicitly, or when the ``ResourceArns`` parameter blank. If you include a list of resources, then any missing context values are instead included under the ``ResourceSpecificResults`` section. To discover the context keys used by a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
            

            - **OrganizationsDecisionDetail** *(dict) --* 

              A structure that details how Organizations and its service control policies affect the results of the simulation. Only applies if the simulated user's account is part of an organization.

              
              

              - **AllowedByOrganizations** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether the simulated operation is allowed by the Organizations service control policies that impact the simulated user's account.

                
          
            

            - **PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail** *(dict) --* 

              Contains information about the effect that a permissions boundary has on a policy simulation when the boundary is applied to an IAM entity.

              
              

              - **AllowedByPermissionsBoundary** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether an action is allowed by a permissions boundary that is applied to an IAM entity (user or role). A value of ``true`` means that the permissions boundary does not deny the action. This means that the policy includes an ``Allow`` statement that matches the request. In this case, if an identity-based policy also allows the action, the request is allowed. A value of ``false`` means that either the requested action is not allowed (implicitly denied) or that the action is explicitly denied by the permissions boundary. In both of these cases, the action is not allowed, regardless of the identity-based policy.

                
          
            

            - **EvalDecisionDetails** *(dict) --* 

              Additional details about the results of the cross-account evaluation decision. This parameter is populated for only cross-account simulations. It contains a brief summary of how each policy type contributes to the final evaluation decision.

               

              If the simulation evaluates policies within the same account and includes a resource ARN, then the parameter is present but the response is empty. If the simulation evaluates policies within the same account and specifies all resources (``*`` ), then the parameter is not returned.

               

              When you make a cross-account request, Amazon Web Services evaluates the request in the trusting account and the trusted account. The request is allowed only if both evaluations return ``true`` . For more information about how policies are evaluated, see `Evaluating policies within a single account <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics>`__ .

               

              If an Organizations SCP included in the evaluation denies access, the simulation ends. In this case, policy evaluation does not proceed any further and this parameter is not returned.

                  A list of the statements in the input policies that determine the result for this part of the simulation. Remember that even if multiple statements allow the operation on the resource, if *any* statement denies that operation, then the explicit deny overrides any allow. In addition, the deny statement is the only entry included in the result.

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    Contains a reference to a ``Statement`` element in a policy document that determines the result of the simulation.

                     

                    This data type is used by the ``MatchedStatements`` member of the ``  EvaluationResult `` type.

                  A list of context keys that are required by the included input policies but that were not provided by one of the input parameters. This list is used when a list of ARNs is included in the ``ResourceArns`` parameter instead of "*". If you do not specify individual resources, by setting ``ResourceArns`` to "*" or by not including the ``ResourceArns`` parameter, then any missing context values are instead included under the ``EvaluationResults`` section. To discover the context keys used by a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

                  - **AllowedByPermissionsBoundary** *(boolean) --* 

                    Specifies whether an action is allowed by a permissions boundary that is applied to an IAM entity (user or role). A value of ``true`` means that the permissions boundary does not deny the action. This means that the policy includes an ``Allow`` statement that matches the request. In this case, if an identity-based policy also allows the action, the request is allowed. A value of ``false`` means that either the requested action is not allowed (implicitly denied) or that the action is explicitly denied by the permissions boundary.

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

  .. py:method:: tag_instance_profile(**kwargs)

    

    Adds one or more tags to an IAM instance profile. If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value.

     

    Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:

     

     
    * **Administrative grouping and discovery** - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name *Project* and the value *MyImportantProject* . Or search for all resources with the key name *Cost Center* and the value *41200* .  
     
    * **Access control** - Include tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only an IAM instance profile that has a specified tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see `Control access using IAM tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . 
     

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . 
       
      * Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

      Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one numeric character (0 to 9).

       

      If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of ``false`` . The result is that passwords do not require at least one numeric character.

      

    
    :type RequireUppercaseCharacters: boolean
    :param RequireUppercaseCharacters: 

      Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one uppercase character from the ISO basic Latin alphabet (A to Z).

       

      If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of ``false`` . The result is that passwords do not require at least one uppercase character.

      

    
    :type RequireLowercaseCharacters: boolean
    :param RequireLowercaseCharacters: 

      Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one lowercase character from the ISO basic Latin alphabet (a to z).

       

      If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of ``false`` . The result is that passwords do not require at least one lowercase character.

      

    
    :type AllowUsersToChangePassword: boolean
    :param AllowUsersToChangePassword: 

      Allows all IAM users in your account to use the Management Console to change their own passwords. For more information, see `Letting IAM users change their own passwords <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/HowToPwdIAMUser.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

       

      If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of ``false`` . The result is that IAM users in the account do not automatically have permissions to change their own password.

      

    
    :type MaxPasswordAge: integer
    :param MaxPasswordAge: 

      The number of days that an IAM user password is valid.

       

      If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of ``0`` . The result is that IAM user passwords never expire.

      

    
    :type PasswordReusePrevention: integer
    :param PasswordReusePrevention: 

      Specifies the number of previous passwords that IAM users are prevented from reusing.

       

      If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of ``0`` . The result is that IAM users are not prevented from reusing previous passwords.

      

    
    :type HardExpiry: boolean
    :param HardExpiry: 

      Prevents IAM users from setting a new password after their password has expired. The IAM user cannot be accessed until an administrator resets the password.

       

      If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of ``false`` . The result is that IAM users can change their passwords after they expire and continue to sign in as the user.

    Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM group.

     

    .. warning::

       

      You should understand the implications of changing a group's path or name. For more information, see `Renaming users and groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_WorkingWithGroupsAndUsers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

       

     

    .. note::

       

      The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the role group with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the group named ``Managers`` to ``MGRs`` , the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both groups. If the principal has permission to update the ``Managers`` group, but not the ``MGRs`` group, then the update fails.

  .. py:method:: update_open_id_connect_provider_thumbprint(**kwargs)

    

    Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new list of thumbprints.

     

    The list that you pass with this operation completely replaces the existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.)

     

    Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate *does* change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.

     

    .. note::

       

      Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation.

       

     

    .. note::

       

      Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider certificate and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the ``UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint`` operation to highly privileged users.

    :type OpenIDConnectProviderArn: string
    :param OpenIDConnectProviderArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM OIDC provider resource object for which you want to update the thumbprint. You can get a list of OIDC provider ARNs by using the  ListOpenIDConnectProviders operation.

       

      For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      A list of certificate thumbprints that are associated with the specified IAM OpenID Connect provider. For more information, see  CreateOpenIDConnectProvider . 

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

        Contains a thumbprint for an identity provider's server certificate.

         

        The identity provider's server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the self-signed X.509 certificate. This thumbprint is used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. The thumbprint is always a 40-character string.

    :param MaxSessionDuration: 

      The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for the specified role. If you do not specify a value for this setting, the default maximum of one hour is applied. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

       

      Anyone who assumes the role from the CLI or API can use the ``DurationSeconds`` API parameter or the ``duration-seconds`` CLI parameter to request a longer session. The ``MaxSessionDuration`` setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using the ``DurationSeconds`` parameter. If users don't specify a value for the ``DurationSeconds`` parameter, their security credentials are valid for one hour by default. This applies when you use the ``AssumeRole*`` API operations or the ``assume-role*`` CLI operations but does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL.

    .. note::

       

      The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the server certificate with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the certificate named ``ProductionCert`` to ``ProdCert`` , the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both certificates. If the principal has permission to update the ``ProductionCert`` group, but not the ``ProdCert`` certificate, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see `Access management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

    We recommend that you use `Certificate Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/>`__ to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. With ACM you can request a certificate, deploy it to Amazon Web Services resources, and let ACM handle certificate renewals for you. Certificates provided by ACM are free. For more information about using ACM, see the `Certificate Manager User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/>`__ .

    .. note::

       

      Because the body of the public key certificate, private key, and the certificate chain can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling ``UploadServerCertificate`` .

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/). This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (``\u0021`` ) through the DEL character (``\u007F`` ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

       

      .. note::

         

        If you are uploading a server certificate specifically for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions, you must specify a path using the ``path`` parameter. The path must begin with ``/cloudfront`` and must include a trailing slash (for example, ``/cloudfront/test/`` ).

         

      

    
    :type ServerCertificateName: string
    :param ServerCertificateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name for the server certificate. Do not include the path in this value. The name of the certificate cannot contain any spaces.

       

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

      

    
    :type CertificateBody: string

  .. py:method:: upload_signing_certificate(**kwargs)

    

    Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the specified IAM user. Some Amazon Web Services services require you to use certificates to validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private key. When you upload the certificate, its default status is ``Active`` .

     

    For information about when you would use an X.509 signing certificate, see `Managing server certificates in IAM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    If the ``UserName`` is not specified, the IAM user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.

     

    .. note::

       

      Because the body of an X.509 certificate can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling ``UploadSigningCertificate`` . For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, see `Signing Amazon Web Services API requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* . For general information about using the Query API with IAM, see `Making query requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

            - **Path** *(string) --* 

              The path to the user. For more information about paths, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

               

              The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

            - **Arn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see `IAM Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . 

              
            

            - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user was created.

              
            

            - **PasswordLastUsed** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide* . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

               

               
              * The user never had a password. 
               
              * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. 
               

               

              A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

               

              This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations. 

              
            

            - **PermissionsBoundary** *(dict) --* 

              For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

              
              

              - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --* 

                The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy`` .

                
              

              - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --* 

                The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

                
          
            

            - **Tags** *(list) --* 

              A list of tags that are associated with the user. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

                     

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token to resume pagination.

We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token to resume pagination.

            - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the policy was created.

              
            

            - **UpdateDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the policy was last updated.

               

              When a policy has only one version, this field contains the date and time when the policy was created. When a policy has more than one version, this field contains the date and time when the most recent policy version was created.

              
            

            - **Tags** *(list) --* 

              A list of tags that are attached to the instance profile. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

                     

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token to resume pagination.

        - **Versions** *(list) --* 

          A list of policy versions.

           

          For more information about managed policy versions, see `Versioning for managed policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Contains information about a version of a managed policy.

             

            This data type is used as a response element in the  CreatePolicyVersion ,  GetPolicyVersion ,  ListPolicyVersions , and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. 

             

            For more information about managed policies, refer to `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . 

            
            

            - **Document** *(string) --* 

              The policy document.

               

              The policy document is returned in the response to the  GetPolicyVersion and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. It is not returned in the response to the  CreatePolicyVersion or  ListPolicyVersions operations. 

               

              The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

              
            

            - **VersionId** *(string) --* 

              The identifier for the policy version.

               

              Policy version identifiers always begin with ``v`` (always lowercase). When a policy is created, the first policy version is ``v1`` . 

              
            

            - **IsDefaultVersion** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether the policy version is set as the policy's default version.

              
            

            - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the policy version was created.

                  The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                   

                  .. note::

                     

                    Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

Activity is only reported for the trailing 400 days. This period can be shorter if your Region began supporting these features within the last year. The role might have been used more than 400 days ago. For more information, see `Regions where data is tracked <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#access-advisor_tracking-period>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

              The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

          A list of users.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Contains information about an IAM user entity.

             

            This data type is used as a response element in the following operations:

             

             
            *  CreateUser   
             
            *  GetUser   
             
            *  ListUsers   
             

            
            

            - **Path** *(string) --* 

              The path to the user. For more information about paths, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

               

              The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

              
            

            - **UserName** *(string) --* 

              The friendly name identifying the user.

              
            

            - **UserId** *(string) --* 

              The stable and unique string identifying the user. For more information about IDs, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

              
            

            - **Arn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see `IAM Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . 

              
            

            - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user was created.

              
            

            - **PasswordLastUsed** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide* . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

               

               
              * The user never had a password. 
               
              * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. 
               

               

              A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

               

              This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations. 

              
            

            - **PermissionsBoundary** *(dict) --* 

              For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

              
              

              - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --* 

                The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy`` .

                
              

              - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --* 

                The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

                
          
            

            - **Tags** *(list) --* 

              A list of tags that are associated with the user. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

              The base32 seed defined as specified in `RFC3548 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548.txt>`__ . The ``Base32StringSeed`` is base64-encoded. 

              
            

            - **QRCodePNG** *(bytes) --* 

              A QR code PNG image that encodes ``otpauth://totp/$virtualMFADeviceName@$AccountName?secret=$Base32String`` where ``$virtualMFADeviceName`` is one of the create call arguments. ``AccountName`` is the user name if set (otherwise, the account ID otherwise), and ``Base32String`` is the seed in base32 format. The ``Base32String`` value is base64-encoded. 

              
            

            - **User** *(dict) --* 

              The IAM user associated with this virtual MFA device.

              
              

              - **Path** *(string) --* 

                The path to the user. For more information about paths, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                 

                The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

                
              

              - **UserName** *(string) --* 

                The friendly name identifying the user.

                
              

              - **UserId** *(string) --* 

                The stable and unique string identifying the user. For more information about IDs, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                
              

              - **Arn** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see `IAM Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user was created.

                
              

              - **PasswordLastUsed** *(datetime) --* 

                The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide* . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

                 

                 
                * The user never had a password. 
                 
                * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. 
                 

                 

                A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

                 

                This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations. 

                
              

              - **PermissionsBoundary** *(dict) --*

              - **Tags** *(list) --* 

                A list of tags that are associated with the user. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource.

                    The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

                    
                  

                  - **Value** *(string) --* 

                    The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                     

                    .. note::

                       

                      Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

                       

                    
              
            
          
            

            - **EnableDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time on which the virtual MFA device was enabled.

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token to resume pagination.

    :type PolicyInputList: list
    :param PolicyInputList: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A list of policy documents to include in the simulation. Each document is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of an IAM policy. Do not include any resource-based policies in this parameter. Any resource-based policy must be submitted with the ``ResourcePolicy`` parameter. The policies cannot be "scope-down" policies, such as you could include in a call to `GetFederationToken <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetFederationToken.html>`__ or one of the `AssumeRole <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html>`__ API operations. In other words, do not use policies designed to restrict what a user can do while using the temporary credentials.

       

      The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see `IAM and STS character quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length>`__ .

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

       

       
      * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range 
       
      * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF`` ) 
       
      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) 
       

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type PermissionsBoundaryPolicyInputList: list
    :param PermissionsBoundaryPolicyInputList: 

      The IAM permissions boundary policy to simulate. The permissions boundary sets the maximum permissions that an IAM entity can have. You can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM entities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . The policy input is specified as a string that contains the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy.

      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ActionNames: list
    :param ActionNames: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A list of names of API operations to evaluate in the simulation. Each operation is evaluated against each resource. Each operation must include the service identifier, such as ``iam:CreateUser`` . This operation does not support using wildcards (*) in an action name.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ResourceArns: list
    :param ResourceArns: 

      A list of ARNs of Amazon Web Services resources to include in the simulation. If this parameter is not provided, then the value defaults to ``*`` (all resources). Each API in the ``ActionNames`` parameter is evaluated for each resource in this list. The simulation determines the access result (allowed or denied) of each combination and reports it in the response. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.

       

      The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the ``ResourcePolicy`` parameter.

       

      If you include a ``ResourcePolicy`` , then it must be applicable to all of the resources included in the simulation or you receive an invalid input error.

       

      For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ResourcePolicy: string
    :param ResourcePolicy: 

      A resource-based policy to include in the simulation provided as a string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this policy attached. You can include only one resource-based policy in a simulation.

       

      The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see `IAM and STS character quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length>`__ .

      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) 
       

      

    
    :type ResourceOwner: string
    :param ResourceOwner: 

      An ARN representing the account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If ``ResourceOwner`` is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any ``ResourcePolicy`` included in the simulation. If the ``ResourceOwner`` parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in ``CallerArn`` . This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user ``CallerArn`` .

       

      The ARN for an account uses the following syntax: ``arn:aws:iam::*AWS-account-ID* :root`` . For example, to represent the account with the 112233445566 ID, use the following ARN: ``arn:aws:iam::112233445566-ID:root`` . 

      

    
    :type CallerArn: string
    :param CallerArn: 

      The ARN of the IAM user that you want to use as the simulated caller of the API operations. ``CallerArn`` is required if you include a ``ResourcePolicy`` so that the policy's ``Principal`` element has a value to use in evaluating the policy.

       

      You can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.

      

    
    :type ContextEntries: list
    :param ContextEntries: 

      A list of context keys and corresponding values for the simulation to use. Whenever a context key is evaluated in one of the simulated IAM permissions policies, the corresponding value is supplied.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Contains information about a condition context key. It includes the name of the key and specifies the value (or values, if the context key supports multiple values) to use in the simulation. This information is used when evaluating the ``Condition`` elements of the input policies.

         

        This data type is used as an input parameter to  SimulateCustomPolicy and  SimulatePrincipalPolicy .

        

      
        - **ContextKeyName** *(string) --* 

          The full name of a condition context key, including the service prefix. For example, ``aws:SourceIp`` or ``s3:VersionId`` .

          

        
        - **ContextKeyValues** *(list) --* 

          The value (or values, if the condition context key supports multiple values) to provide to the simulation when the key is referenced by a ``Condition`` element in an input policy.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
        - **ContextKeyType** *(string) --* 

          The data type of the value (or values) specified in the ``ContextKeyValues`` parameter.

          

        
      
  
    :type ResourceHandlingOption: string
    :param ResourceHandlingOption: 

      Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that support resource-based policies require different combinations of resources. By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation.

       

      Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security-group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network-interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the EC2 scenario options, see `Supported platforms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* .

       

       
      * **EC2-Classic-InstanceStore**   instance, image, security-group 
       
      * **EC2-Classic-EBS**   instance, image, security-group, volume 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-InstanceStore**   instance, image, security-group, network-interface 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-InstanceStore-Subnet**   instance, image, security-group, network-interface, subnet 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-EBS**   instance, image, security-group, network-interface, volume 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-EBS-Subnet**   instance, image, security-group, network-interface, subnet, volume

            This data type is used by the return parameter of ``  SimulateCustomPolicy `` and ``  SimulatePrincipalPolicy `` .

            
            

            - **EvalActionName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the API operation tested on the indicated resource.

            - **MatchedStatements** *(list) --* 

              A list of the statements in the input policies that determine the result for this scenario. Remember that even if multiple statements allow the operation on the resource, if only one statement denies that operation, then the explicit deny overrides any allow. In addition, the deny statement is the only entry included in the result.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Contains a reference to a ``Statement`` element in a policy document that determines the result of the simulation.

                 

                This data type is used by the ``MatchedStatements`` member of the ``  EvaluationResult `` type.

                    The line containing the specified position in the document.

                    
                  

                  - **Column** *(integer) --* 

                    The column in the line containing the specified position in the document.

                    
              
            
          
            

            - **MissingContextValues** *(list) --* 

              A list of context keys that are required by the included input policies but that were not provided by one of the input parameters. This list is used when the resource in a simulation is "*", either explicitly, or when the ``ResourceArns`` parameter blank. If you include a list of resources, then any missing context values are instead included under the ``ResourceSpecificResults`` section. To discover the context keys used by a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
            

            - **OrganizationsDecisionDetail** *(dict) --* 

              A structure that details how Organizations and its service control policies affect the results of the simulation. Only applies if the simulated user's account is part of an organization.

              
              

              - **AllowedByOrganizations** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether the simulated operation is allowed by the Organizations service control policies that impact the simulated user's account.

                
          
            

            - **PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail** *(dict) --* 

              Contains information about the effect that a permissions boundary has on a policy simulation when the boundary is applied to an IAM entity.

              
              

              - **AllowedByPermissionsBoundary** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether an action is allowed by a permissions boundary that is applied to an IAM entity (user or role). A value of ``true`` means that the permissions boundary does not deny the action. This means that the policy includes an ``Allow`` statement that matches the request. In this case, if an identity-based policy also allows the action, the request is allowed. A value of ``false`` means that either the requested action is not allowed (implicitly denied) or that the action is explicitly denied by the permissions boundary. In both of these cases, the action is not allowed, regardless of the identity-based policy.

                
          
            

            - **EvalDecisionDetails** *(dict) --* 

              Additional details about the results of the cross-account evaluation decision. This parameter is populated for only cross-account simulations. It contains a brief summary of how each policy type contributes to the final evaluation decision.

               

              If the simulation evaluates policies within the same account and includes a resource ARN, then the parameter is present but the response is empty. If the simulation evaluates policies within the same account and specifies all resources (``*`` ), then the parameter is not returned.

               

              When you make a cross-account request, Amazon Web Services evaluates the request in the trusting account and the trusted account. The request is allowed only if both evaluations return ``true`` . For more information about how policies are evaluated, see `Evaluating policies within a single account <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics>`__ .

               

              If an Organizations SCP included in the evaluation denies access, the simulation ends. In this case, policy evaluation does not proceed any further and this parameter is not returned.

              
              

              - *(string) --*

              - *(dict) --* 

                Contains the result of the simulation of a single API operation call on a single resource.

                 

                This data type is used by a member of the  EvaluationResult data type.

                
                

                - **EvalResourceName** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the simulated resource, in Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format.

                  
                

                - **EvalResourceDecision** *(string) --* 

                  The result of the simulation of the simulated API operation on the resource specified in ``EvalResourceName`` .

                  
                

                - **MatchedStatements** *(list) --* 

                  A list of the statements in the input policies that determine the result for this part of the simulation. Remember that even if multiple statements allow the operation on the resource, if *any* statement denies that operation, then the explicit deny overrides any allow. In addition, the deny statement is the only entry included in the result.

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    Contains a reference to a ``Statement`` element in a policy document that determines the result of the simulation.

                     

                    This data type is used by the ``MatchedStatements`` member of the ``  EvaluationResult `` type.

                    
                    

                    - **SourcePolicyId** *(string) --* 

                      The identifier of the policy that was provided as an input.

                      
                    

                    - **SourcePolicyType** *(string) --*

                    - **EndPosition** *(dict) --* 

                      The row and column of the end of a ``Statement`` in an IAM policy.

                - **MissingContextValues** *(list) --* 

                  A list of context keys that are required by the included input policies but that were not provided by one of the input parameters. This list is used when a list of ARNs is included in the ``ResourceArns`` parameter instead of "*". If you do not specify individual resources, by setting ``ResourceArns`` to "*" or by not including the ``ResourceArns`` parameter, then any missing context values are instead included under the ``EvaluationResults`` section. To discover the context keys used by a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --*

                - **PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail** *(dict) --* 

                  Contains information about the effect that a permissions boundary has on a policy simulation when that boundary is applied to an IAM entity.

                  
                  

                  - **AllowedByPermissionsBoundary** *(boolean) --* 

                    Specifies whether an action is allowed by a permissions boundary that is applied to an IAM entity (user or role). A value of ``true`` means that the permissions boundary does not deny the action. This means that the policy includes an ``Allow`` statement that matches the request. In this case, if an identity-based policy also allows the action, the request is allowed. A value of ``false`` means that either the requested action is not allowed (implicitly denied) or that the action is explicitly denied by the permissions boundary. In both of these cases, the action is not allowed, regardless of the identity-based policy.

                    
              
            
          
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token to resume pagination.

    :type PolicySourceArn: string
    :param PolicySourceArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a user, group, or role whose policies you want to include in the simulation. If you specify a user, group, or role, the simulation includes all policies that are associated with that entity. If you specify a user, the simulation also includes all policies that are attached to any groups the user belongs to.

       

      The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see `IAM and STS character quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length>`__ .

       

      For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      

    
    :type PolicyInputList: list
    :param PolicyInputList: 

      An optional list of additional policy documents to include in the simulation. Each document is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of an IAM policy.

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

       

       
      * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range 
       
      * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF`` ) 
       
      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) 
       

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type PermissionsBoundaryPolicyInputList: list
    :param PermissionsBoundaryPolicyInputList: 

      The IAM permissions boundary policy to simulate. The permissions boundary sets the maximum permissions that the entity can have. You can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. An IAM entity can only have one permissions boundary in effect at a time. For example, if a permissions boundary is attached to an entity and you pass in a different permissions boundary policy using this parameter, then the new permissions boundary policy is used for the simulation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM entities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . The policy input is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy.

      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) 
       

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ActionNames: list
    :param ActionNames: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A list of names of API operations to evaluate in the simulation. Each operation is evaluated for each resource. Each operation must include the service identifier, such as ``iam:CreateUser`` .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ResourceArns: list
    :param ResourceArns: 

      A list of ARNs of Amazon Web Services resources to include in the simulation. If this parameter is not provided, then the value defaults to ``*`` (all resources). Each API in the ``ActionNames`` parameter is evaluated for each resource in this list. The simulation determines the access result (allowed or denied) of each combination and reports it in the response. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.

       

      The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the ``ResourcePolicy`` parameter.

       

      For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type ResourcePolicy: string
    :param ResourcePolicy: 

      A resource-based policy to include in the simulation provided as a string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this policy attached. You can include only one resource-based policy in a simulation.

       

      The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see `IAM and STS character quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length>`__ .

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

       

       
      * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range 
       
      * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF`` ) 
       
      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) 
       

      

    
    :type ResourceOwner: string
    :param ResourceOwner: 

      An account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If ``ResourceOwner`` is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any ``ResourcePolicy`` included in the simulation. If the ``ResourceOwner`` parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in ``CallerArn`` . This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user ``CallerArn`` .

      

    
    :type CallerArn: string
    :param CallerArn: 

      The ARN of the IAM user that you want to specify as the simulated caller of the API operations. If you do not specify a ``CallerArn`` , it defaults to the ARN of the user that you specify in ``PolicySourceArn`` , if you specified a user. If you include both a ``PolicySourceArn`` (for example, ``arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/David`` ) and a ``CallerArn`` (for example, ``arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob`` ), the result is that you simulate calling the API operations as Bob, as if Bob had David's policies.

       

      You can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.

       

       ``CallerArn`` is required if you include a ``ResourcePolicy`` and the ``PolicySourceArn`` is not the ARN for an IAM user. This is required so that the resource-based policy's ``Principal`` element has a value to use in evaluating the policy.

       

      For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      

    
    :type ContextEntries: list
    :param ContextEntries: 

      A list of context keys and corresponding values for the simulation to use. Whenever a context key is evaluated in one of the simulated IAM permissions policies, the corresponding value is supplied.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Contains information about a condition context key. It includes the name of the key and specifies the value (or values, if the context key supports multiple values) to use in the simulation. This information is used when evaluating the ``Condition`` elements of the input policies.

         

        This data type is used as an input parameter to  SimulateCustomPolicy and  SimulatePrincipalPolicy .

        

      
        - **ContextKeyName** *(string) --* 

          The full name of a condition context key, including the service prefix. For example, ``aws:SourceIp`` or ``s3:VersionId`` .

          

        
        - **ContextKeyValues** *(list) --* 

          The value (or values, if the condition context key supports multiple values) to provide to the simulation when the key is referenced by a ``Condition`` element in an input policy.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
        - **ContextKeyType** *(string) --* 

          The data type of the value (or values) specified in the ``ContextKeyValues`` parameter.

          

        
      
  
    :type ResourceHandlingOption: string
    :param ResourceHandlingOption: 

      Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that support resource-based policies require different combinations of resources. By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation.

       

      Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the EC2 scenario options, see `Supported platforms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* .

       

       
      * **EC2-Classic-InstanceStore**   instance, image, security group 
       
      * **EC2-Classic-EBS**   instance, image, security group, volume 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-InstanceStore**   instance, image, security group, network interface 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-InstanceStore-Subnet**   instance, image, security group, network interface, subnet 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-EBS**   instance, image, security group, network interface, volume 
       
      * **EC2-VPC-EBS-Subnet**   instance, image, security group, network interface, subnet, volume 
       

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

        

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --*

            - **MissingContextValues** *(list) --* 

              A list of context keys that are required by the included input policies but that were not provided by one of the input parameters. This list is used when the resource in a simulation is "*", either explicitly, or when the ``ResourceArns`` parameter blank. If you include a list of resources, then any missing context values are instead included under the ``ResourceSpecificResults`` section. To discover the context keys used by a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
            

            - **OrganizationsDecisionDetail** *(dict) --* 

              A structure that details how Organizations and its service control policies affect the results of the simulation. Only applies if the simulated user's account is part of an organization.

              
              

              - **AllowedByOrganizations** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether the simulated operation is allowed by the Organizations service control policies that impact the simulated user's account.

                
          
            

            - **PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail** *(dict) --* 

              Contains information about the effect that a permissions boundary has on a policy simulation when the boundary is applied to an IAM entity.

              
              

              - **AllowedByPermissionsBoundary** *(boolean) --* 

                Specifies whether an action is allowed by a permissions boundary that is applied to an IAM entity (user or role). A value of ``true`` means that the permissions boundary does not deny the action. This means that the policy includes an ``Allow`` statement that matches the request. In this case, if an identity-based policy also allows the action, the request is allowed. A value of ``false`` means that either the requested action is not allowed (implicitly denied) or that the action is explicitly denied by the permissions boundary. In both of these cases, the action is not allowed, regardless of the identity-based policy.

                
          
            

            - **EvalDecisionDetails** *(dict) --* 

              Additional details about the results of the cross-account evaluation decision. This parameter is populated for only cross-account simulations. It contains a brief summary of how each policy type contributes to the final evaluation decision.

               

              If the simulation evaluates policies within the same account and includes a resource ARN, then the parameter is present but the response is empty. If the simulation evaluates policies within the same account and specifies all resources (``*`` ), then the parameter is not returned.

               

              When you make a cross-account request, Amazon Web Services evaluates the request in the trusting account and the trusted account. The request is allowed only if both evaluations return ``true`` . For more information about how policies are evaluated, see `Evaluating policies within a single account <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics>`__ .

               

              If an Organizations SCP included in the evaluation denies access, the simulation ends. In this case, policy evaluation does not proceed any further and this parameter is not returned.

                - **EvalResourceDecision** *(string) --* 

                  The result of the simulation of the simulated API operation on the resource specified in ``EvalResourceName`` .

                  
                

                - **MatchedStatements** *(list) --* 

                  A list of the statements in the input policies that determine the result for this part of the simulation. Remember that even if multiple statements allow the operation on the resource, if *any* statement denies that operation, then the explicit deny overrides any allow. In addition, the deny statement is the only entry included in the result.

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    Contains a reference to a ``Statement`` element in a policy document that determines the result of the simulation.

                     

                    This data type is used by the ``MatchedStatements`` member of the ``  EvaluationResult `` type.

                    
                    

                    - **SourcePolicyId** *(string) --*

                - **MissingContextValues** *(list) --* 

                  A list of context keys that are required by the included input policies but that were not provided by one of the input parameters. This list is used when a list of ARNs is included in the ``ResourceArns`` parameter instead of "*". If you do not specify individual resources, by setting ``ResourceArns`` to "*" or by not including the ``ResourceArns`` parameter, then any missing context values are instead included under the ``EvaluationResults`` section. To discover the context keys used by a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

                  Contains information about the effect that a permissions boundary has on a policy simulation when that boundary is applied to an IAM entity.

                  
                  

                  - **AllowedByPermissionsBoundary** *(boolean) --* 

                    Specifies whether an action is allowed by a permissions boundary that is applied to an IAM entity (user or role). A value of ``true`` means that the permissions boundary does not deny the action. This means that the policy includes an ``Allow`` statement that matches the request. In this case, if an identity-based policy also allows the action, the request is allowed. A value of ``false`` means that either the requested action is not allowed (implicitly denied) or that the action is explicitly denied by the permissions boundary. In both of these cases, the action is not allowed, regardless of the identity-based policy.

                    
              
            
          
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token to resume pagination.

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: change_password(**kwargs)

    

    Changes the password of the IAM user who is calling this operation. This operation can be performed using the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the **My Security Credentials** page in the Management Console. The account root user password is not affected by this operation.

     

    Use  UpdateLoginProfile to use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the **Users** page in the IAM console to change the password for any IAM user. For more information about modifying passwords, see `Managing passwords <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingLogins.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

    :param NewPassword: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The new password. The new password must conform to the account's password policy, if one exists.

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ that is used to validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can include almost any printable ASCII character from the space (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range (``\u00FF`` ). You can also include the tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password. However, many tools, such as the Management Console, might restrict the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning within that tool.

      * This operation does not support partial updates. No parameters are required, but if you do not specify a parameter, that parameter's value reverts to its default value. See the **Request Parameters** section for each parameter's default value. Also note that some parameters do not allow the default parameter to be explicitly set. Instead, to invoke the default value, do not include that parameter when you invoke the operation.

      Anyone who assumes the role from the or API can use the ``DurationSeconds`` API parameter or the ``duration-seconds`` CLI parameter to request a longer session. The ``MaxSessionDuration`` setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using the ``DurationSeconds`` parameter. If users don't specify a value for the ``DurationSeconds`` parameter, their security credentials are valid for one hour by default. This applies when you use the ``AssumeRole*`` API operations or the ``assume-role*`` CLI operations but does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL.

  .. py:method:: create_saml_provider(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an IAM resource that describes an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML 2.0.

     

    The SAML provider resource that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in an IAM role's trust policy. Such a policy can enable federated users who sign in using the SAML IdP to assume the role. You can create an IAM role that supports Web-based single sign-on (SSO) to the Management Console or one that supports API access to Amazon Web Services.

     

    When you create the SAML provider resource, you upload a SAML metadata document that you get from your IdP. That document includes the issuer's name, expiration information, and keys that can be used to validate the SAML authentication response (assertions) that the IdP sends. You must generate the metadata document using the identity management software that is used as your organization's IdP.

     

    .. note::

       

      This operation requires `Signature Version 4 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__ .

       

     

    For more information, see `Enabling SAML 2.0 federated users to access the Management Console <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html>`__ and `About SAML 2.0-based federation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

    Uploads a server certificate entity for the account. The server certificate entity includes a public key certificate, a private key, and an optional certificate chain, which should all be PEM-encoded.

     

    We recommend that you use `Certificate Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/>`__ to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. With ACM you can request a certificate, deploy it to Amazon Web Services resources, and let ACM handle certificate renewals for you. Certificates provided by ACM are free. For more information about using ACM, see the `Certificate Manager User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/>`__ .

     

    For more information about working with server certificates, see `Working with server certificates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . This topic includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.

     

    For information about the number of server certificates you can upload, see `IAM and STS quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

      Because the body of the public key certificate, private key, and the certificate chain can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling ``UploadServerCertificate`` . For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, see `Signing Amazon Web Services API requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

    Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the specified IAM user. Some Amazon Web Services services require you to use certificates to validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private key. When you upload the certificate, its default status is ``Active`` .

     

    For information about when you would use an X.509 signing certificate, see `Managing server certificates in IAM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    If the ``UserName`` is not specified, the IAM user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.

        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

           

          .. note::

             

            Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

        The path prefix for filtering the results. For example, the prefix ``/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/`` gets all groups whose path starts with ``/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/`` .

         

        This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all groups. This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the !

        Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

         

        If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

        The path prefix for filtering the results. For example, the prefix ``/application_abc/component_xyz/`` gets all roles whose path starts with ``/application_abc/component_xyz/`` .

         

        This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all roles. This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes.

        Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

        

      
      :type MaxItems: integer

        Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

         

        If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

  Attributes
  
  Attributes provide access to the properties of a resource. Attributes are lazy-loaded the first time one is accessed via the :py:meth:`load` method.
  For more information about attributes refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: arn

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see `IAM Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . 

      

  .. py:attribute:: create_date

    

    - *(datetime) --* 

      The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user was created.

      

  .. py:attribute:: password_last_used

    

    - *(datetime) --* 

      The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide* . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

       

       
      * The user never had a password. 
       
      * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. 
       

       

      A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

       

      This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations. 

      

  .. py:attribute:: path

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The path to the user. For more information about paths, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

       

      The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

      

  .. py:attribute:: permissions_boundary

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      
      

      - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --* 

        The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy`` .

        
      

      - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

        
  

  .. py:attribute:: tags

    

    - *(list) --* 

      A list of tags that are associated with the user. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      
      

      - *(dict) --* 

        A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

        
        

        - **Key** *(string) --* 

          The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

          
        

        - **Value** *(string) --* 

          The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

           

          .. note::

             

            Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

             

          
    
  

  .. py:attribute:: user_id

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The stable and unique string identifying the user. For more information about IDs, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      

  .. py:attribute:: user_name

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The friendly name identifying the user.

  Attributes
  
  Attributes provide access to the properties of a resource. Attributes are lazy-loaded the first time one is accessed via the :py:meth:`load` method.
  For more information about attributes refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: policy_document

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The policy document.

       

      IAM stores policies in JSON format. However, resources that were created using CloudFormation templates can be formatted in YAML. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

      

  .. py:attribute:: policy_name

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The name of the policy.

    You can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the **Users** page in the IAM console to delete a password for any IAM user. You can use  ChangePassword to update, but not delete, your own password in the **My Security Credentials** page in the Management Console.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Deleting a user's password does not prevent a user from accessing Amazon Web Services through the command line interface or the API. To prevent all user access, you must also either make any access keys inactive or delete them.

  .. py:method:: create_version(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new version of the specified managed policy. To update a managed policy, you create a new policy version. A managed policy can have up to five versions. If the policy has five versions, you must delete an existing version using  DeletePolicyVersion before you create a new version.

     

    Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default version. The default version is the version that is in effect for the IAM users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached.

     

    For more information about managed policy versions, see `Versioning for managed policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

    :type PolicyDocument: string
    :param PolicyDocument: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The JSON policy document that you want to use as the content for this new version of the policy.

       

      You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

       

      The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see `IAM and STS character quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length>`__ .

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

       

       
      * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range 
       
      * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF`` ) 
       
      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) 
       

      

    
    :type SetAsDefault: boolean
    :param SetAsDefault: 

      Specifies whether to set this version as the policy's default version.

       

      When this parameter is ``true`` , the new policy version becomes the operative version. That is, it becomes the version that is in effect for the IAM users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to.

    :returns: PolicyVersion resource
    

  .. py:method:: delete()

    

    Deletes the specified managed policy.

     

    Before you can delete a managed policy, you must first detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that it is attached to. In addition, you must delete all the policy's versions. The following steps describe the process for deleting a managed policy:

     

     
    * Detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to, using  DetachUserPolicy ,  DetachGroupPolicy , or  DetachRolePolicy . To list all the users, groups, and roles that a policy is attached to, use  ListEntitiesForPolicy . 
     
    * Delete all versions of the policy using  DeletePolicyVersion . To list the policy's versions, use  ListPolicyVersions . You cannot use  DeletePolicyVersion to delete the version that is marked as the default version. You delete the policy's default version in the next step of the process. 
     
    * Delete the policy (this automatically deletes the policy's default version) using this operation.

      :type Marker: string
      :param Marker: 

        Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

        

      
      :type MaxItems: integer
      :param MaxItems: 

        Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

         

        If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

  Attributes
  
  Attributes provide access to the properties of a resource. Attributes are lazy-loaded the first time one is accessed via the :py:meth:`load` method.
  For more information about attributes refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: create_date

    

    - *(datetime) --* 

      The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the policy version was created.

      

  .. py:attribute:: document

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The policy document.

       

      The policy document is returned in the response to the  GetPolicyVersion and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. It is not returned in the response to the  CreatePolicyVersion or  ListPolicyVersions operations. 

       

      The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

      

  .. py:attribute:: is_default_version

    

    - *(boolean) --* 

      Specifies whether the policy version is set as the policy's default version.

        If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

  Identifiers
  
  Identifiers are properties of a resource that are set upon instantation of the resource.
  For more information about identifiers refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: role_name

    *(string)* The RolePolicy's role_name identifier. This **must** be set.

  .. py:attribute:: name

    *(string)* The RolePolicy's name identifier. This **must** be set.
  .. rst-class:: admonition-title
  
  Attributes
  
  Attributes provide access to the properties of a resource. Attributes are lazy-loaded the first time one is accessed via the :py:meth:`load` method.
  For more information about attributes refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: policy_document

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The policy document.

       

      IAM stores policies in JSON format. However, resources that were created using CloudFormation templates can be formatted in YAML. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

      

  .. py:attribute:: policy_name

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The name of the policy.

      
  .. rst-class:: admonition-title
  
  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: delete()

    

    Deletes the specified inline policy that is embedded in the specified IAM role.

     

    A role can also have managed policies attached to it. To detach a managed policy from a role, use  DetachRolePolicy . For more information about policies, refer to `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      role_policy.load()
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: put(**kwargs)

    

    Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM role.

     

    When you embed an inline policy in a role, the inline policy is used as part of the role's access (permissions) policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using  CreateRole . You can update a role's trust policy using  UpdateAssumeRolePolicy . For more information about IAM roles, see `Using roles to delegate permissions and federate identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html>`__ .

     

    A role can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a role, use  AttachRolePolicy . To create a new managed policy, use  CreatePolicy . For information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed with a role, see `IAM and STS quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

      Because policy documents can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling ``PutRolePolicy`` . For general information about using the Query API with IAM, see `Making query requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      The policy document.

       

      You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

       

       
      * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range 
       
      * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF`` ) 
       
      * The special characters tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` )

        - **Value** *(string) --* 

          The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

           

          .. note::

             

            Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

  .. py:attribute:: password_last_used

    

    - *(datetime) --* 

      The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide* . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

       

       
      * The user never had a password. 
       
      * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. 
       

       

      A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

       

      This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations. 

      

  .. py:attribute:: path

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The path to the user. For more information about paths, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

       

      The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

      

  .. py:attribute:: permissions_boundary

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      
      

      - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --* 

        The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy`` .

        
      

      - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

        
  

  .. py:attribute:: tags

    

    - *(list) --* 

      A list of tags that are associated with the user. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

        A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

        
        

        - **Key** *(string) --* 

          The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

          
        

        - **Value** *(string) --* 

          The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

           

          .. note::

             

            Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

             

          
    
  

  .. py:attribute:: user_id

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).

       

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the !

        If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.

         

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

           

          .. note::

             

            Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

             

          

        
      
  
    
    :rtype: :py:class:`iam.User`

  .. py:method:: create_access_key_pair()

    

    Creates a new Amazon Web Services secret access key and corresponding Amazon Web Services access key ID for the specified user. The default status for new keys is ``Active`` .

     

    If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials. This is true even if the account has no associated users.

     

    For information about quotas on the number of keys you can create, see `IAM and STS quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

     

    .. warning::

       

      To ensure the security of your account, the secret access key is accessible only during key and user creation. You must save the key (for example, in a text file) if you want to be able to access it again. If a secret key is lost, you can delete the access keys for the associated user and then create new keys.

  .. py:method:: create_login_profile(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a password for the specified IAM user. A password allows an IAM user to access Amazon Web Services services through the Management Console.

     

    You can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the **Users** page in the IAM console to create a password for any IAM user. Use  ChangePassword to update your own existing password in the **My Security Credentials** page in the Management Console.

      The new password for the user.

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ that is used to validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can include almost any printable ASCII character from the space (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range (``\u00FF`` ). You can also include the tab (``\u0009`` ), line feed (``\u000A`` ), and carriage return (``\u000D`` ) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password. However, many tools, such as the Management Console, might restrict the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning within that tool.

      

    
    :type PasswordResetRequired: boolean
    :param PasswordResetRequired: 

      Specifies whether the user is required to set a new password on next sign-in.

  .. py:method:: create_policy(**kwargs)

    

    Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM user.

     

    An IAM user can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a user, use  AttachUserPolicy . To create a new managed policy, use  CreatePolicy . For information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

    :type PolicyDocument: string
    :param PolicyDocument: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The policy document.

       

      You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

       

       
      * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\u0020`` ) through the end of the ASCII character range 
       
      * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF`` )

    :rtype: :py:class:`iam.UserPolicy`
    :returns: UserPolicy resource
    

  .. py:method:: delete()

    

    Deletes the specified IAM user. Unlike the Management Console, when you delete a user programmatically, you must delete the items attached to the user manually, or the deletion fails. For more information, see `Deleting an IAM user <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html#id_users_deleting_cli>`__ . Before attempting to delete a user, remove the following items:

      :param Marker: 

        Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

      :param MaxItems: 

        Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true`` .

         

        If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true`` , and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

  Attributes
  
  Attributes provide access to the properties of a resource. Attributes are lazy-loaded the first time one is accessed via the :py:meth:`load` method.
  For more information about attributes refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: policy_document

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The policy document.

       

      IAM stores policies in JSON format. However, resources that were created using CloudFormation templates can be formatted in YAML. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

      

  .. py:attribute:: policy_name

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The name of the policy.

        - **Value** *(string) --* 

          The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

           

          .. note::

             

            Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

             

          
    
  

  .. py:attribute:: user_attribute

    

    - *(dict) --*

If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

         

         
        * The user never had a password. 
         
        * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. 
         

         

        A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

         

        This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations.

        - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --* 

          The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy`` .

          
        

        - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --* 

          The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

          
    
      

      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        A list of tags that are associated with the user. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .
